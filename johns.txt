we do kind of like christmas with our red and green today's video is the one you guys have been asking about the most probably since we've announced that it's all about him and his reaction when i told him that we were having a baby and i already posted on my channel the video i took when i found out i was pregnant which you guys really enjoyed and thought was very funny do you want to talk about the day before what happened yeah because she knew a full 15 hours before i did she had to hold that secret so the day before i had the pregnancy test in my bathroom drawer but again i'd have been for like a week and i was like i'm not taking these it's a waste of pregnancy test and then one night i was home alone you were filming for fake book marcus place your igtv thing and i was like you know what i'm about to start cooking dinner and i'm just going to take this pregnancy test and then i of course found out it was positive and i had already invited cody and lexi over for dinner that night i remember i was making chicken pot pie and marcus and his like camera crew and cody and lexi were basically all getting to the house at the same time so i came home it was late at night we had just bought these snowmobiles it was like the last episode of fake with marcus place and my two friends were over and we have her reaction on camera being like oh my gosh the snowmobiles but really the whole time she was just thinking about how she's pregnant and she couldn't say because my friends were over and cody and lexi were coming over okay are you uh are you cooking yes are you cooking up something good yes you always do all right i have a big surprise for the family you do so i wanted to obviously wait for marx and i to be alone and i of course wanted to film his reaction when i told him for the first time that we're having a baby so i just had to wait all night until the next morning i remember the night that i found out you were laying in bed you were looking at old pictures of you and your dad and do you remember what you said that night you you showed me a picture of you and your dad waterskiing when you were little you're like this is what i'm gonna be like when i'm a dad and right when you said that i was like oh my gosh you are a dad right now yeah i think i have the picture it was a it was like me or maybe my sister knee boarding and my dad was like holding on to the rope and like holding like a baby and i just remember my heart was racing so much and i was like how do i not tell him right now it took like all the willpower in the world so then the next morning i was like marcus i'm filming a video and i want you to react this dress so just set up the camera and i'm gonna walk in because i've done like try on hauls where he's reacted to the clothes so i thought that was my best bet because marcus knows when i'm filming him like i can never sneakily prank him and like him not know that i'm videoing so i knew i had to make it blatant that i was filming him but something like still sneaky so yeah i go in the room i set up the camera and then here this is oh my gosh i'm shaking um so i've known since last night around five that i'm pregnant and i have not told marcus yet and it has been the hardest thing to keep from him but i knew i wanted to tell him during the day so i could film it because i know we want this memory forever so um i came up with this idea it was the first idea that came to my head and i'm just going with it but i told him that i want him to react to a dress that i'm trying on for a clothing haul that i'm doing for youtube and um i'm just gonna tell him i'm i don't know i don't know what i'm gonna do but he's awake i'm gonna um go set up the camera i'm so nervous okay okay okay should i put it here okay   let me okay your eyes okay ready yes isn't this a pretty dress wouldn't it be perfect if i was pregnant in this dress like a perfectly stretches huh well looks like you're going to a fancy dinner shut up shut up shut up no no no no no are you serious i'm pregnant i don't know how to react right now i found out last night oh dude and i took like five tests [Laughter] good job dude i'm proud of you it's gonna be fun can you believe it no it's been so hard to not tell you like this last night i'm just like my heart's been beating so yeah whoa i i almost don't even feel like it's real right now i know well that's the thing i'm just like it's not real but then i took another test this morning and it was also real so can you believe it oh shoot okay whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on i know it's like really unexpected so i'm almost two months pregnant   and i haven't had any symptoms like i don't feel nauseous tired anything you're the exact same pregnancy as cody lexi yeah so she's three weeks ahead of me that's it three weeks that's another that is the reason why i'm just like okay cool let's roll if i if they hadn't had been pregnant i would be taking out even more i'd be freaking out but now since i've already accepted like okay our lives are changing they're having a kid like cool like let's do it and let's have like three more because now it's easy do you want to see the other pregnancy tests and how many i'll show you and i took this weird one that i found that's pregnant and this is the second one i took but it had like an error on it because i didn't pee enough on it i don't know dude okay so look i'm pregnant right doesn't that mean i'm pregnant i mean it can't malfunction four times in a row i know hey man so are you an uncle or a broder you don't even know okay i have a couple things to say about just reacting to this video i couldn't believe it at first and i was like no no no you're joking because two days before two maybe three days before we had found out that my brother is pregnant with the baby and lexi is pregnant it's like what the heck like so the fact that she's telling me that we're pregnant and there's just too much pregnancy going on at once i couldn't imagine that it was real i thought she was pranking me because sometimes she does that but but when she started you know sometimes but but when you started crying i was like oh my gosh okay all right let's go and then i just was then i was just really happy i was like all right but i had to get over the whole idea that like cody and lexi were just pregnant and i'm still feeling weird that like my brother is about to have a baby and it just it's just a lot of information to take in and then once i could kind of get that out of the way of the reality of the situation i was very excited about like being a dad i was like all right let's go i'm excited and then camper and honey are such a distraction the whole time just like running around helping each other but they could tell that they can really feel our energy and they knew that some good news had just happened they were just so excited so it was it was a lot of fun that me and you both said no no no no no no no no no no no no and it wasn't like no no no we don't want this it was like this cannot be real yeah like we both felt that way and i just remember i was i had so many pent up emotions because i had found out and not told anyone so i just immediately started crying when i told you because i was just like finally i can tell you it felt like so long that i had to wait but yeah i was just excited i was like all right cool let's roll you know and i also think that kristen sometimes like like if you if you think that i'm like oh i don't know where i'm you will start to feel weird so i want to just be like okay we got this you know what i mean yeah because i don't think you're ever ready to find out you're having a baby if you're not actively planning and trying to have a baby so i was like all right like you either you either go no what in in or you just say okay we're doing this and you kind of just have to like when you're on top of a huge ramp you got to just drop in fully and stomp that foot down and just send it or else you you'll just you'll eat it at the bottom of the ramp and so that's that was kind of my my thought process was like all right we're having a baby i'm going to be excited about it and and i am but you have to like make that conscious decision of being like all right let's do it and now i feel like we're both at a place where it's just like feels so much more real we've gotten to see the baby and ultrasound and i'm 16 weeks now really we got to hang out with stevie and cezanne's newborn baby and like that was really you know visualize like what it's actually going to be like and then that made me so excited because i was like wow marcus loves little babies like you just love just holding her and i never did before i wasn't ever really like i wasn't like oh an infant me neither i've never really been like that but now like that i have one on the way i fully get it i've always been a kid person though i've always loved like playing with with kids and goofing around with kids but like an infant you can't really talk to or communicate with so i just had a disconnect but now i fully understand like how special they are and how vulnerable they are and why they're cool because they're vulnerable well i hope you guys enjoyed watching that video i'm honestly so happy i was thinking about it last night that we even like filmed our reactions because normally i wouldn't even like think about filming this kind of stuff but it's like these are the most like the realest moments that we get to go back and look at and it's just really special so i'm happy that we got to share with you guys and we'll probably do one more video of the reactions of all of our friends and families and stuff and like one big compilation yeah and then just keep talking about the journey of having a kid yeah and moving and moving and all this stuff that's going to take place very soon very exciting stuff we're in a real season of change but there's no one i'd rather do it with than you yeah so if you guys like this video give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe and we will see you guys very soon bye one two three we're pregnant she's pregnant but i had a little bit to do with it she had a little bit to do with it but we won't get too much into that well let's start from the beginning right now i am currently 14 weeks pregnant and a couple of days so officially out of the first trimester which was a little bit rough to say the least yes a little bit and we've known since we've known since november 16th that's right so we've been keeping a secret from you guys for a while a long secret so yesterday we announced officially on instagram so if you follow us over there you might have already heard the news but we of course wanted to make a video telling you guys more details because i know a lot of you guys probably have lots of questions we're so excited but also so surprised very surprised it was the biggest surprise of our lives i would say yeah four months after the accident we conceived a baby so let's just tell them a little bit about the story of how we found out i took a video when i took the pregnancy test that we'll show you guys in a later video we have marcus's reaction lexi and cody's reaction which if you guys don't know they are also having a baby that's the other thing is we're all having a baby within the same time frame exactly but it was completely unplanned so most people are like you guys plan this we didn't plan it zero planning they told us and then three days later we told them when lexi and cody told us that they were having a baby we were obviously so excited we were like okay we're gonna be aunt and an uncle and we were so excited but when she told me it made me think wait when was the last time i had my period and i was like no no i'm not gonna take a pregnancy test because there's no possible way that i'm pregnant because i've taken so many pregnancy tests just when i think maybe i'm a few days late and it's just never pregnant but then i was like 11 days late and i was like okay so i got a pregnancy test marcus wasn't home no one was home one night and i just decided to take it it was pregnant and i was so shocked okay so i have all my pregnancy tests right here so many pregnancy tests because i was like there's no way so i have all of these pregnancy tests look at these excuse me you're having a baby i took all of these pregnancy tests and they were all very positive like you know how sometimes the line is like kind of faint well my lines were like so pregnant i was just like oh my gosh i even had to google is it possible to get seven false positive pregnancy tests and i was like no you're pregnant then i told marcus and how did you feel i was ready to roll as soon as i found out i was like all right sick let's do it zero reservations i was shocked when i was like i think i was mostly shocked because cody and lexie had just told us so i thought maybe she's like playing a prank on me it was funny because i was so so shocked when i found out that i was almost like panicky because i was like we were not planning this am i like mentally prepared for this but then when i told marcus and he was just 100 happy 100 excited i was like okay everything's gonna be okay it's fine we are prepared to have babies and and he just like made me feel calm we have one boy name one girl name we still don't know what it's gonna be i feel like right when i found out like i saw the positive pregnancy test i don't know if something in my heart was just like it's a boy like that was my first like reaction but now i have no idea so yeah i think most people have said it's gonna be a boy most people think that lexi and cody are gonna have a girl we're gonna have a boy yeah but it would be fun if they were the same so they could just be like little best friend like twins kind of but honestly we'll be happy either i think it's it's for the opposite sex it's always like you don't you don't know how to yeah you don't know how to identify with them as much so like you know how to take care of like like i want the i want an infant a baby girl but then after it's a baby girl i'm starting to get older and teenage years i'm like all right that's a mom's territory you know so like i want to show it you know where i can throw the football but like i don't care what it's gonna be like when it's an infant once a baby at all it's just gonna be perfect should we talk a little bit about how the first trimester was like yeah cause i got a lot of people asking like if i was sick she threw up every single day uh okay she threw up five days a week for four weeks pretty much yeah yeah when i first found out i was actually five weeks pregnant i think and i didn't have any symptoms at all the only thing was that i was like craving salty things that happened like right away but then um at seven or eight weeks i started feeling the nausea and it was basically pretty much in the mornings i just like didn't even want to get out of bed because i knew if i got out of bed i'd be throwing up and it's funny because certain things will like trigger me to throw up like if i'm brushing my teeth oh yeah there's that brush in my teeth and in the mornings like if i open the trash can it's like full of like yesterday's trash then that smell will also make me throw up she hasn't been throwing up recently but she threw up one time yesterday for the first time like a week and camper's eating ice and um it was it was the worst throw up that i had seen her do like she was like bad she was like like nasty and it just like kept coming out usually nothing happened she just dried these but there was like a lot of goo that came out that time dude think about this kristen broke her dang hip in the accident and her femur but like imagine there could have been all types of complications but like praise god we're chilling dude there's nothing wrong with their hips they're gonna spread out just birth that baby like a wide canal no problem so everything's good medically with person i heard the heartbeat for the first time a few weeks back that was pretty cool it's kind of scary like your first appointment because you're like okay this is where you find out if everything's okay if the baby's in the right place it's like you're worried i don't know i was very anxious before the first appointment and then we heard the little heartbeat it was i think there were seven weeks when we heard the heartbeat and it was just so so fast so you're measuring seven weeks by the ultrasound oh wow can you hear them well i think maybe it makes sense to you guys more now why we're like we're moving that was the big reason so we're going to be finding a house having a baby figuring it's a lot but i feel like so at peace about our decision to move and i think it's gonna be really really nice to be closer to family i think we always said like we're here while we're young in l.a and it's fun but when it comes time to like raising a family i want my kids to be in like you know just a different place a different environment should i show them my belly show them your belly okay i feel like this last week it's gotten bigger here it is can you see it there's a grid lit in there there's a little griblet in there somehow grab that there this is the baby right now you know those abs that tell you how big your baby is right now our baby is the size of a navel orange wait we had to get the whole family in it to say our goodbye to you but one last thing also while the dogs are here i really think that camper and honey both sense that i'm pregnant camper always lays on my stomach and he usually follows me around the house but now it's like he will never not know where i am in the house follows me everywhere he definitely knows she knows also knows but she's kind of like slimy we're so excited that you guys finally know thank you for being so nice and also so excited on our announcement on instagram it just made us feel like so loved and so excited to continue to share this journey with you guys he doesn't want to be on the journey with us and that concludes this very short-ish update video they are camper's home right now so that's very appropriate for this video we caught him in the mood but we love you guys thank you for watching make sure to subscribe if you want to follow along on the journey give this video a thumbs up we will see you very soon baby loves you too baby bye good morning today is an exciting day because marcus is going to be doing my morning routine   i'm gonna bring you through my morning routine making coffee doing my skincare routine which by the way thank you to clinique for sponsoring this video and i'm going to show you what i do with the dogs my tidy up routine did you ever shave your face in the morning because i need to do that kind of yeah every morning i shave my face now we can do your version of my morning routine so is that perfect ready to begin now it's time to take the babies outside to go potty who's ready we're ready should i open the door oh fine let's have a party time the fountains are on what does that mean that it's nine o'clock it means it's 9am look at that special there look how trained you are yeah you used to keep in the house in your baby yeah okay now i usually after i let the dogs out i'll do like my skincare routine brush my teeth so it's time for you to get a little skincare routine you ready okay let's go i don't have to shave my face but you do in the mornings right yeah let's do a cool transition where you're standing there and then you go and your face is shaved okay ready not shaved face okay you gotta remember it's at nose height perfect okay we're gonna give marcus a little skin care routine and all growing up my dad always used clinique and i think this is perfect to give him yeah he always did to give him a little skincare routine that i've also been using in the morning from clinique because this is actually a really cool product this is their clarifying lotion you use this twice a day once in the morning and once at night for about three minutes and it's really cool because it gets off dead skin flakes from your skin it also gets rid of like pollution and stuff like that things that i never do things that you never do and things that make your skin not be able to absorb moisture which is really important so i'm going to show you guys a cool little test with a cotton ball in my little jar that looks like a cotton ball so we're gonna put this clarifying lotion on one of my hands this is um like a liquid exfoliator so it's gonna again help moisture absorb into your skin and i'm not going to put it on the other hand but then i'm also going to put on the clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion so i applied a little bit of that to the hand that we put the clarifying lotion on and then we're going to also apply it to the hand that didn't have anything on it and rub it in and watch this okay as you can see it absorbed super fast and then on this one you can see it's taking a lot longer to absorb into the skin so you can kind of see how that would help your skin absorb moisture throughout the day and throughout the night so let's put some on so clinique offers this clarifying lotion in five different types so we have type number one this is for very dry skin they also have it for combination skin oily skin all of that good stuff okay now apply this to your face gently sweeping motions on your face and neck okay look at all the dirt on my stinking face oh my gosh gonna do your neck as well you come home from a long day's work got the dirt on me and they use clinique to get it off a little bit of dirt on the helmet too dramatically different moisturizing lotion how much just like a pea that a pea size yeah that's good oh it's soaked to the bone okay let's see who has more dirt on their face do you ever have dirt on your cotton ball face never cause i washed my face out last night so did i no you didn't yeah the dirt just really likes me oh now i'm just gonna apply a little bit of this to my face and we're skin cared for the day now it's time to brush our teeth you want to brush your kid well it's your morning routine so i'm going to do what you do how do you brush them in circles back and okay forth rush like this yeah i hate that that's horrible you don't do circles you go back and forth like you're like you're trying to cut a rope now that our faces are looking beautiful feeling good it's time to let the babies in hey they're like it's time for breakfast hey doing some beefest you want some beef oh that's a beefest who's ready for some breakfast yeah one scoop [ __ ] bendy one sweet [ __ ] usually while i let them eat i'll do like a quick little tidy around the house okay so first i like fluff the pillows and on the pouch i also open the blinds over here pretty good do you smack it really hard just get out all your aggression on it i hate marcus now i open the blinds oh i don't open that one not this one that not that one you hide the cancer yeah i don't like seeing the trash can perfect hey and now the dogs are all happy and then i usually poop right yeah hey all right come on let's go outside and on a day like today i'll usually keep the door open because it's really pretty outside hey it's so nice man you could be inside of the dog now it's really my favorite part of the morning time to make some coffee her new found addiction it's not an addiction it's just a love it's just a pathway to addiction okay so you're gonna press the power button okay oh my gosh now take that little thing right there and you're gonna place it into the coffee machine like this exactly wait wait wait don't go in don't go anything because i think i need to refill the coffee i need to refill it let me do that really quick and and what you do is you just get the beans and you just pour it in how much who knows she'll tell me when to stop okay okay now we press power no now you push this in and now we push this in but let go oh my gosh you smack the top make sure the beans filter down okay perfect love that now you're gonna get out a little kitchen towel kitchen towel this can make a mess because it can make a mess and so you're gonna pull this out and set it right here okay now i'm gonna pull this out and set it right here even it out with your finger while it's straight just boink yeah just kind of get it in there evened out okay now let me get this this is a tamp so first you're gonna do this and spin it around to distribute the coffee and then press it down like with that second then stamp it yep exactly just spin it in to tighten it that way oh babes it's kind of oh that's good that's good oh shoot okay now you're gonna make latte art with some milk okay so pour the milk to the second line pour the milk to the second line check now we're gonna turn the steam on okay just don't do it yet it has to warm up first oh my gosh pull it to the corner to make a whirlpool okay do you see the whirlpool yeah don't don't do that don't let that sound happen it's good because that's putting too much air in it and then we can actually don't don't let that happen it's hard when you try to pull it under one it's about to spill out then tip it careful babe see how you have the crema on top that's very good how did i do that it just means it's a good shot of espresso oh no it has that foamy on top okay okay and we can come over this way tap your milk on the counter top to get the bubbles out okay now just pour it however you would think uh do i make a design and stuff yeah you can make a design can you pour in little bits and use a spoon to like get designs and stuff it's not going to start getting foamy till you get okay oh well i don't know let me pour out some milk this is for all the marbles right here look how good that looks perfect lie and then now wait i'm not done i'm not done this is called the uber twirl oh oh my gosh oh my gosh look at that twirl you've never seen a twirl like that before look at that unbelievable twirl that's actually pretty amazing wow better than me on his first try your first coffee creation it's not bad but i'm going to be zoinked after this just that one sip um if i had like three more sips i would be late your first design was so good really yeah i'm serious cheers to marcus's first coffee now would you have to say that it's a lot of work for a cup of coffee totally it would never do experiment over there you would never do it it's kind of calming now nope what's what do i normally do next oh yes i usually do my morning devotion so i have my devotion book my journal and my bible and i'll just go sit outside and drink my coffee and do it okay   so we just finished our devotion time i think marcus really enjoyed it right oh yeah i loved it it's time to make some breakfast and this is usually you know it depends day to day if i'm gonna do like a bigger breakfast or just like cereal or a smoothie today i'm feeling a smoothie so you want to learn yeah let's do it let's do it have you ever used this blender uh i'm not personally like taking it out okay i'll get it all set up for you and then i will just let you do pick the ingredients okay okay i laid out all your options so you can just put in whatever you got blueberries pineapples mangoes bananas and spinach really you put spinach in our stuff yeah a lot and then we have some protein collagen and some milk so i'm gonna completely guess all of this yeah so you're going for the berry blend first i feel like banana mango blueberry is a solid thing i like my stuff very bananay i don't know how many put in but we're going to just go with the clean like probably like two whole bananas i would say i like mine very mannery is that a lot all right we'll see and then we're gonna sprinkle about this many blueberries not too many oh there's it's multiple berries blend i'm gonna go a little lighter on the berries we're also gonna go mango chunks not too too many we're gonna make this thing sweet sweet sweet so i'm gonna go maybe like three pineapple actually i take that back i want it to be more banana but you like when it has the tangy flavor are you giving me a hint yeah you are i'll do i'll do two more and that's it because i gotta ride or die you know what i mean and then we'll do what i would have guessed is only a pinch of greens she says a lot but i probably would have only done like this much so we're gonna just do that much no do more for health trust me you can't even taste the spinach in it well well i do want to still drink it and get my greens in all right that's it this is where it can get crazy so i'm going to under do the protein because i don't want it to be disgusting oops and i'm going to say two scoops of protein one rounded two the way you make a mess kind of not even look there's not even a single piece rub your hand on that see i wiped it all off the counter you couldn't even feel it and here's the suction thing so we clearly put it in there hold on and then milk i know trust me trust me trust me you pour the milk from the top through the hole now we're gonna do some milk just just we're gonna pour it about a quarter of the way up ah right there um could i drink about that much do a little more that we're gonna do that we're gonna see what happens with that okay now we are going to move this around at level four and a half and then i'm gonna i'm gonna push the middle and then i'm gonna know that that doesn't work and then going to do up that's not going to do anything and i'm going to press smoothie and then something's awfully wrong and i grab the baton while it's spinning okay okay all right all right all right but see what i would have done is probably just mix it and try it again but we'll do the baton spin you like it so far yeah i think you need a little more liquid the more you smoothie it like mix it doesn't make it more liquidy though sometimes you're gonna let people make mistakes you know get in the kitchen and some of it let's see what's going on with this for a second i'm finding this difficult to let go of the control of the smoothie see it's not even moving at all look at that so that's how you know that it needs a little more and now we're going to just go blink really get that in there maybe even a little bit more blink all right let's try that let's see how it pours really quick yeah it's like a frozen puppy these types are hard to pour okay that's okay   right now we got a little water on the top but that's okay it's not the end of the world it's actually going to help us kind of mix it up and make it a little bit more drinkable now this is what kristen does and this is where our lives intersect at this very moment poor pork done my guess your breakfast is ready and then we wait i made my voice sound so attractive okay let me try it again   all right i'm gonna try to do the most realistic one that i possibly can hi guys your breakfast is ready oh sounds horrible and then you heard you just heard what's that kristen your breakfast is ready uh-huh okay now so now you get up all excited i take ten minutes to come get it no that's not true it's not even close so get out of the bed and now he's gonna be like wait what the heck marcus is getting out of bed that means it's a dang party now and then i usually say this i say what do i say kristen you say okay and then i have what is the one thing i have to do before you get the breakfast i'm gonna go to the bathroom yes so let's go to the bathroom really quick you can't see me going to the bathroom yeah yeah i need you to stand up though when you do it and now this is the moment of truth where we see what type of breakfast we got and today it's uh nice and we're always thankful right thank you so much that's right and then before we do it we kind of assess how much damage has been done in the kitchen okay not that bad so this is an easy one but of course there's a smoothie so we know what's going on it's about like you know three to five minutes of dishes like not even close and now we'll sit down no no we never stand in this drinkers but we always sit down that's right we might like you know look at our phone a little bit but then we we say thank you one more time thank you so much okay and then now we sip it and let's see how good this thing is is it good pretty good then we lie if it's not good and is that what you're doing right now well it's good it's just very banana-y that's well that's what i like yeah so you actually like it and that's alternate reality yeah so you really love it and it's the best thing you've ever had yeah all right let's see if this thing's actually good that's super nannery it's a little like bland you know what i'm saying yeah yeah i think more mangoes would have done it pineapple it might have been that water that i spilt in a little bit kind of watered it down maybe oops interesting i just got a really good sip i think you just gotta kind of mix it around please stop i know whatever you would make you would say you liked it because you're like trying to prove yourself that's not true i said it's not as good as other things but i got a good sip some sips were bad since for good i just got a feeling of love for you good okay so i guess that wraps up today's morning routine switch and i also wanted to say thank you again to clinique for sponsoring this video maybe marcus will start you know a little skincare routine looking young for a few extra years and don't forget to subscribe to our channel for many more videos and we will see you again soon hey guys and welcome back to our channel the last time you saw us we were telling you the story of our accident and many things have happened since yes how long has it been three months three months yeah it's been almost six months no no no no since we did the video oh up four months i think really yeah wow time flies really fast when you're not doing your youtube channel nothing has changed also at the same time this is a camper he's just many things have changed and nothing has changed so today we kind of just want to use this video to update you guys answer some of your questions and also we're going to answer some of your assumptions as well because you sent some of those in and just give you a live update how are you feeling since the accident i feel really good yeah i feel like my mobility is coming back i'm able to skip mostly because i can't jog on the left leg so i kind of did we just started up our like athletic physical therapy mine oh no it's tomorrow it's tomorrow are you sure yes i'm positive for sure i'm positive because it's 1 30 and it starts at 12 30. oh my gosh but isn't that the worst feeling when you're like my appointment yes it's like when you were in high school or college and you were like the test there's a discussion due like you know that's the worst feeling there's nothing worse right now we are at the point of being like okay life is going to start feeling like very normal i feel like it's like 85 normal but then the physical abilities that you're like wait i want to run and i want to jog yeah are the things that kind of hold you back but i think mentally we're fully back to being normal yeah it's more so just physically when we want to play sports or you want to lunge for that one ball that someone hits during pickleball you're like i can't do that but now my brain is allowing me to be like i want it before i didn't even want to move there's nothing worse than your mind holding you back because your mind does have so much control over your physical body even like when we were in the hospital it was weird the doctors were like make sure you're touching your leg feeling your leg squeezing your leg because sometimes your brain will like disconnect that injured part of yourself from your body all right should we start with the questions dude someone says has the accident pushed back your timeline on wanting a baby no i think it's accelerated it because it's made us kind of go oh shoot life's short let's get this kid popping i was going to say the opposite because we were like we definitely want to travel a lot more before well i think it's made the reality of having a kid more apparent but i think because we keep saying arbitrarily two years three years but now i think we're like no like we want a kid and we need to plan for it like asap it kind of just felt like something off in the distant future but now it's like concrete where we're gonna like plan when we're having our kid yeah whereas before we did it how has the accident affected your marriage has it brought you closer together yes if we can get through that season of life together we can get through anything cause two people being in such extreme pain for so many months it brings you so much closer together and just experiencing something like that that we know no one will ever know what we actually went through except for me and you and just that in it of itself that's a good way to put it because when someone else is going through pain you just don't feel what they're feeling but i don't think that there is a more comparable thing where we both were in the same exact accident and we both had similar injuries like we both broke our legs on the left side the whole process has just been very parallel i don't think many people get to go through something like that so it's very it's very he wants to get down okay okay it's very cool to like go through that together my pants are just bombed with hair yeah mine too okay camper's back with us for the third question when will you be able to talk about details from the accident and do you think you will or would yeah i think we're actually pretty close um really yeah i think that i think that we're close like to the case being closed it's very unlikely that that an amazing circumstance is going to come out of this i think it's just one of those situations where you get hit by a car and you're lucky to be alive and and the guy gets away and oops that sucks babe we can't say that why why can't you say that the guy possibly gets him gets away he knows he got away yeah he does a duh he knows he got away he's sitting there going hey got away he doesn't have to hear me say that for him to know he just did unfortunately i think it's looking a bit bleak yeah what's your top state to move to from your choices right now i would say texas is our number one state i think we like north carolina and tennessee too because we love the mountains but we don't really know many people there who are currently living there we know a lot of people who are from there so that just makes it difficult because you kind of want to move to a place where you have a built-in network so really outside of austin and florida we don't really have a built-in network where we could just go in and feel like home okay last question and then we're going to move on to the assumptions what is happening with your engagement ring slash wedding rings are you gonna repair the old ones get a new one yeah i lost my wedding ring in in the hospital they took all of it off and i never got it back when you get admitted to the hospital and you have to have like cat scans and mris and all that stuff you have to take off all the metal on your body so they took off my wedding rings my earrings all that kind of stuff and put them in a little bag and i didn't know where they went after that and then they came in like two days later and said hey we found these wedding rings underneath your hospital bed that you were in yesterday are they yours and i was like yeah but i thought you guys put them somewhere safe so i totally think that the hospital probably lost your wedding rings because they almost lost mine yes we definitely want to get um mine fixed because all the diamonds and stuff are still in it it's just completely bent in half should i go grab it really yeah show them wait did you show it in the last video no they wrote on it that it was found in bed so weird but this is what my wedding ring looks like see it's completely bent in half let's put it on that's your engagement ring oh i always get those two confused oh my gosh doesn't even fit me anymore okay here's what it looks like it's completely bent so i think i should just grab some pliers and i'd be so scared actually just think about this for a second like this bent but her finger didn't break yeah but this hand broke but i mean think about how much force there had to have been to just bend just your band yeah like how weird that you like hit the ground you were like i probably just hit it so hard on the ground did you get even scrapes on your hand well i broke my hand right here like this bone is fractured to see how it's like thick right there so that was confirmed yeah my hand was fractured and my toes fractured but they didn't like do anything about my hand or my toe because there's nothing really they could do let's move into the assumptions it's about to get real juicy and hot and heated in here because of your accent you haven't been able to be intimate oh my gosh it's only up to the game but we've made up for lost time someone assumed kristen is actually super funny even though most people see marcus as the funny one uh yeah definitely i think it depends with the group if we're with our group of friends i think kristen is making our group of friends laugh more than i am i think to a more mass audience or if you don't know who i am the closer you get to me the less funny i get essentially and the closer you get to me the more funnier wow that's so true i i think it's true because you're not making jokes all the time and like saying funny things no i think i i think i just reel it back and i don't try to be as funny there are certain times where i do i think i'm hilarious i think he would be good i think he would be good i assume that marcus was really popular in high school they didn't say really i added really i assume that marcus was popular in high school and you were a shy wall flower totally true that's a good assumption very true i wouldn't say i was a shy wall flower but i definitely was not like homecoming queen or anything like that but marcus was like president of every club had everything i got all c's in high school but i was like involved in everything see i got a 4.0 no you didn't yes i did gpa you got all a's no yes i did are you kidding yeah you got a freaking 4.0 uh i i scraped together a 3-0 but i would get c's because i was so overextended doing everything else and i didn't really give a rip about it look look look c's get degrees i agrees except for i didn't get a degree i just have my aaa okay let's let's just do one more no no four more speed round babe just okay okay marcus isn't a touchy feely type guy but you force him to be oh heck no did i touch hannah so touchy feel some other people assume that we don't give each other a lot of affection but i feel like since we don't give each other a lot of affection off on camera but we do and really i need a little more i think yeah marcus always says of the physical affection level please but marcus is very physical affection i feel like marcus is always embarrassed in your vlogs lol uh sometimes probably yeah she's doing something that's extremely feminine i just think wow this is so not me and different and i really think it's funny but how do you feel when i like make you try my food bib imagine for example i'm hanging with the boys okay and someone just throws me a freaking score on the first one i grab and i go yeah and i chest bump everyone like don't you think it's a little bit silly no oh okay well sick dude you've made a full letter all right let's say dude i freaking crack back a freaking briskey and chug it and then i go i love dolphins like the football team yeah i love that like would you be like that's a little silly no what if i like arm wrestle guy i'm like yeah i'm stronger than you chest bumps when you be like that's a little silly you're so lying now so just get out of here i love this question kristen you're down to earth and humble and you don't realize how beautiful you are no she knows she knows she's freaking sexy dude it is really hard to pick good ones just just read like i want you to read four in a row no matter how bad four in a row you all get tired of the influence your life yes yes for sure okay marcus has never cooked you dinner 100 for sure you never fight not true for sure be honest not true for sure not true you hate spicy food marcus loves spicy food no we both like it at the same time marcus can't cook yes you know what though i do not care what people say i don't cook oops i do so many other things but i don't cook and i never want to cook if i wanted to get really mad that you don't cook if i wanted to cook dude i would just be a boss cook he's like kristen i completely understand how much time and effort goes into cooking and thank you for doing it but he just doesn't cook himself and that's fine i don't do the dishes he always does dishes you keep your life pretty private even though you're famous i would say that kristen is more famous than me and i think in her dms she's getting tons of people and she's getting tons of engagement and tons of like um like over stimulation if that's that's probably not a word um but i do not feel that way at all i think life is perfect how it is right now because we can go out and live our normal life without having a mob of people and but we meet one or two fans when we go out and it's like so nice and chill i think right now is like the perfect amount of fame but the whole question was can you live a private life oh yeah we live an extremely private life like would you say i would definitely say even though our life is like a lot in front of the cameras especially mine you would think i'm not a very private person but i am an extremely private oh yeah dude after this i mean besides the time it takes to set up the camera and just sit here and shoot the video she's gonna review the comments and spend a little bit of time for about an hour but then after this like it's just like regular life okay guys i think this wraps up this video let us know in the comments below what you guys would like to see from us because we can really use some good ideas and things that you want to see us do so if you did like this video please give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to the channel do we have an outro handshake or something i feel like i remember us having that yeah it was like dude that's disgusting and there's only two situations in which i get this you decide if you want to leave this in it's shooting a video because you're just like nervous you're thinking about answers and you're just like i gotta get and when i play video games because you're like yeah just but i never sweat i literally never sweat that's why they call me the camel because i just store that water inside and i can just go forever dude you're not gonna put that in are you cause that's disgusting yeah i'll put it in but you gotta kiss me if you want me to get it out all right now you have lipstick hey guys as you might have noticed we have been on a pretty long youtube hiatus and that is because we got into a horrible accident if you guys already follow us on instagram you might know some details about it but we wanted to take this time to tell you guys the full story so we are gonna do this YouTube video as though you have no idea what happened and go through all the details because some people may not know what happened to us so anyways without further ado on May 11th at 7:56 me and Kristen were smashed by an oncoming car that was going somewhere between 60 and 80 miles an hour breaking news from Toluca Lake where police say a speeding car hit a bicyclist and two pedestrians and then took off that's right this investigation is still ongoing there's a look back there LAPD with the entire area sealed off some video now coming in this is the scene shortly after the incident paramedics rush year and 10 - the two victims the two pedestrians witnesses described them as two teenagers one about a 15 year old boy and maybe a girl a couple years younger they had gone up over the hood and it looks like they had also taken out the side mirror he also says that the impact knocked off the front license plate it was last seen near universal studios but tonight the driver is still on the loose so you guys know we ride it together almost every single day we go on like little evening rides for 30 minutes and this day was no different I remember I just put on a beanie and I was like Marcus I don't really want to wear my helmet because we're going on a ten minute ride and you just said come on you just got a new helmet just wear it just to be safe and yeah I was especially like no you're wearing your helmet yeah because she we have a bunch of helmets if you watched our other electric bike video she doesn't like the certain green helmet that I make her where she thinks it's ugly so I said she ordered this helmet this white cute helmet on Amazon and she had just bought it and had it worn it and I was like no you're wearing the stinkin helmet that you just bought because you think it looks cute so you're definitely going to wear a helmet so that for sure saved her life because but we'll get to it we'll get to the crash so crash so anyways she puts on her helmet and we go for a ride so we go through our usual neighborhood and we turned down a street that we always like to go down because there are never any cars there's usually a lot of people and a lot of bikers and it's a dead-end street with multiple stop signs and multiple speed bumps between those stop signs so there's kind of no reason to think oh this is a busy street and you have your guard up well I remember hearing this car way down at the end of the road going and I was like okay this cars going very fast so I turned to Kristen and I said oh my gosh what is this guy doing I look up and I see him coming straight at us that was laughing so I saw him probably a football fields length away and by the time I finished that sentence he was like feet in front of us we're about to smash into each other mind you there's a stop sign about 50 feet in front of us so I'm also thinking why is this guy going so fast because he's gonna have to stop at the stop sign well he didn't stop at the stop sign he blasted through it and we were on the far right side of the road and this car was on the far right side of his lane so I was on the left side and he completely swerves and turns at us and that's when I was just like what am I gonna do and I tried to swerve at the last second and by that point I knew when he swerved at us I freaked out and tried to swerve out of the way as a last ditch effort and it was too late it wasn't gonna happen and I knew at that point I'm going over this car and we're smashing this car full on and oh that's just such a weird experience to feel there's a few moments like from accident that I can be completely transported back to you in my brain and being hit by the car and flipping in the air and we flew 50 feet when the car hit us from our bike and I just can remember that so clearly just thinking oh my gosh what is happening it's like so slow and so fast thank you yes at this point I'll continue the story because you kind of lost consciousness at first when you passed yes this was the most traumatic part of the whole thing was oh my gosh I'm not gonna cry it's been too long and um but I remember I was awake the whole time and I was laying down on the concrete and Marcus was laying next to me and the first thing I looked down I saw my leg was like my left leg was laying across my whole body and I just thought oh wow my leg is definitely gonna get cut off like amputated because it was like like jello like it was not a normal leg I didn't feel anything from the waist down like I couldn't feel anything so I lifted my leg and put it down next to me and then I looked over to Marcus and he just looked like totally not himself and he had throw-up coming up and I was just like he's brain dead for sure puts his helmet flew off so I thought he I was my first thought was I'm never gonna be able to talk to my husband again so the first thing I did was I just thought if he's gonna be going into coma I feel like I had heard that you're supposed to make people talk and like say and so I reached over to you I grabbed your face and I said are you okay are you okay Murphy say your name but the craziest thing was is that I couldn't talk at that moment I remember it was like my brain was completely working but I literally couldn't say Marcus I was like ma like my mouth was like it was like slow motion but I grabbed you by your face and I was finally came to and I said are you okay are you okay and you started talking like weird like not normally like it was like like horrible then I kept going like this to your face as much as I could saying what Marcus are you okay say your name and then you were like you said your name you know like are you okay and you finally started coming to like your normal self and that's when I was like okay he's not brain-dead like he's not paralyzed where he can't speak and right and then that was the most horrific part of the whole thing is thinking in that moment that I would that you were gone I was very confused at that point I have a couple we have a video of it was about seven minutes after we got hit when the ambulance and everything showed up someone started recording and we'll show this video   okay either here you can tell when you look in my eyes and her eyes were both just fully in shock and even though like I'm talking and like slowly moving around I'm completely confused and so the point being is when you've been hit when you get hit by a car like that and you're just on the ground you're confused you have no idea what's going on around the witnesses and the people who are there when they saw what happened everyone screamed because they thought that we had just completely died there was a lot of witnesses that saw what happened and I remember we had a few people standing around us holding our hands like I just remember looking at this guy I had no idea who he was just a random older guy and I just was holding his hand so tight I was looking at him and his eyes like are we gonna die are we gonna die am I ever gonna walk again and he was just like so calming and I just feel like in that moment jesus's presence was so apparent for so many reasons first reason is that the type of fracture I got in my femur there's a specific name for it but like when it completely shatters in the middle like 99.9% of people pass out from the pain right when it happens and the fact that I had no feeling for my hips down of anything and it just makes me think like I was either just fully in shock or like who knows maybe I was paralyzed from the waist down and and jesus healed me right there I mean we don't know but Marcus I remember still completely out of it was just saying Jesus name no we're saying if anybody here believes in Jesus please just like praise his name and say his name over and over again pray for healing and pray that we're gonna be okay and it was crazy to hear just all these random people we didn't know just praying Jesus name over us it's pretty crazy that that was like my initial go to like my subconscious my just soul was like screaming for Jesus I was like I don't care about anything else I just like that's who you go to when you're like am I gonna live it was just such a weird experience and I was so like out of my brain that it just nothing felt real I just felt like yeah it's like you're in a dream yeah it's just like you have a very impaired vision yeah so the paramedics came everyone came it was like a crazy scene helicopters everything and I just remember the paramedics like when they get there you just think wow everything's gonna be okay like help us here it was comforting but at the same time that was when my pain was setting in and I was starting to feel how horribly I was injured and I just remember them asking us questions what's her name blah blah and they loaded it first me into an ambulance and took me to the hospital first and then you wanted a separate ambulance they came after me at this point we didn't know why the car hit us we just thought this car was trying to kill us on purpose that's all we knew we were just riding her bike and all of a sudden a car is going 80 miles an hour and then swerves at us and smashes into us so the only when I woke up in the hospital like when I became conscious in the hospital I looked over and I saw Cody my brother who was there and I just said dude we got hit by a car and they tried to kill us they tried to run into us and that's that's all I know like what happened why did the car try to hit us you have a video of us talking yesterday at the dinner table about the whole hospital experience and Cody axon videos in the hospital so we'll show those videos we got the call at 9:35 p.m. from a Beverly Hills number remember babe we were like who's calling us and we normally never answer this like we don't answer random calls ever but I said Beverly Hills and I was like okay yeah it was late so I'm like why would we get a call from someone a random number so late as soon as they said it was the hospital your brother and I was just like what did they say exactly can you remember your brother Marcus Johns asked me to call you him and his wife have been in an accident and she goes yeah they were hit by a car while riding their bike and I was like your mind goes to the worst possible thing Oh me up so immediately and I literally fell to my knees I fell to my knees and started praying because yeah and then Cody was really collected and he was like are they okay what's going on they said their heads okay but are there a bottom half we don't know right yeah they talked to Marcus I looked at him in there and you were you know you were sitting there you were like I do I don't remember anything right my first memory is of you in the hospital yeah and I filmed it I need to give you this video really yeah so listen we we heard I heard a scream but our loud yell whatever and I just thought whatever why Wow Marcus Marcus knew it was Kristen's scream yeah do you remember I do remember that over my years cover my ears and I was like and I was like this is so bumped up and I cover his ears okay we don't have time we're about to drill into your knee bone we're going to put four screws into your knee while you're awake to put your femur in traction which is basically when they pull up with this machine to make the bone not like this anymore but like this so it's on top of each other and they did the same thing to mark I was in there with you they wouldn't let me go back to see Marcus and they made me sit with one of the nurses in which this is when they showed me this picture oh is that my FEMA and other such persons mark wall Marcus have wanted me to film he's like hey film cuz why I haven't seen Kristin since the accident and you guys went in different ambulances right so do I hate film is so this was the moment this is the moment when they they brought Chris in I love you so much baby I love you so much Kristen this sucks I'm so sorry this happened in she can't believe you forget did that I don't know my left leg hurts so bad but everything else is fine and that's what we were able to first kind of talk to each other and then realize Oh what happened what was your side of the story what do you remember why did this happen and we just had all these questions and I remember a police officer came in and he didn't do a full list of questions but I remember him coming in and taking pictures I was weird it's like a crime scene in the hospital and he was taking pictures and I asked him some questions and I said what the heck happened and so this is the story that we got from the very beginning that we put on social media and essentially what we're gonna have to do since it's still an active crime investigation we're gonna recap the details and we've already talked about we can't further talk about the investigation just because it can ruin the investigation so anyways we're gonna have to just not talk about the details that we know but it's crazy it's weird there was some sort of burglary something to do with burglary someone said burglary so we were like oh okay there's a burglary it was a burger and the police were chasing this car they were pursuing this car the car kind of got away somehow and we found this car in the the neighborhood and when the car saw the cop again in the neighborhood it just took off we thought at that point that he swerved and tried to hit us on purpose in order for the police to kind of stop and deal with that situation so he could get away we don't know why he did that we don't know why he was initially being chased officially as of yet but he wouldn't hit us he got away he got away and got on the highway and the police didn't catch him and yeah we can't this is all public information and we've been instructed to not talk about it moving forward so eventually there's gonna be updates obviously about the story but at the time the police did not catch the person and the person got away and is still out and that's what we know apparently our shoes flew off right when we got hit by the car our shoes stayed and got knocked off our feet and our bodies flew like 50 feet and I was talking to my dad he was a paramedic firefighter for her what is it 30 years 35 years something crazy like that and he said every single time someone gets hit very hard and they see the shoes on the ground they know it was a bad hit and it pretty much always happens where the body goes in the shoes stay which is weird that's where the phrase and knock-your-socks-off comes from because that literally happens which is so weird to think of it I was just thinking you know you hear okay my shoes blew off but think about wearing tied up tennis shoes and think how hard you have to shake your leg you could never shake your leg hard enough to get your shoe to fly off yeah that's true but that's how fast and hard the impact was where your shoes just come off and in Marx's helmet yeah buckled well my helmet was next to me on the ground so what we think is the helmet saved my life when I flew my head smashed but then my helmet flew off probably after the impact because I would have been bleeding and everything but then I probably hit my head again after bouncing the second time which is what probably knocked me out but I just have to say this like we should be dead the Tigers are spines all right we all have internal bleeding our nanny we don't have scars or scratches all over our face both of our legs we got crushed look see all the scars down the side of her leg that should have been everywhere yeah and I just remember when I got admitted to the ER they were like okay we need to flip you over because you're not we need to put bandages over all your road rash all over your back and I was like I really don't think I have anything on my back and they were like no 100% you do flips me over so painful because my femurs literally shattered in your hip and my hip and they're like you don't have any scratches on your back like I don't understand I'm like I don't understand you there the fact that I'm even talking right now I don't understand and it's just there's no other explanation except for that Jesus saved us god save us a miracle we were talking about this when you've come like very close to death you know you start realizing how important and how amazing life is and you stop saying like oh Jesus saved us in that incident but it's like Jesus God saves you every day every day you wake up you're given a chance yeah you're given life and like no now we definitely don't take that for granted look you wake up here just like whoa I'm chillin I'm alive it's one thing to be like oh man I can't walk and I'll never take walking for granted again but like now it's like life it's like oh I'm alive dude I'm feeling good like God is good and I'm alive yeah even though we're in so much pain still every single day it's like when we do get sad or I start to cry and think about all the things I used to be able to do I'm right there met with the fact that I'm alive and that's a miracle and I'm so grateful to be alive because the fact that we didn't die in the accident just wakes you up and you just everything is put into perspective yeah you don't care about silly stupid things anymore right in that moment everything changes and I mean it's honestly a blessing to go through something like this because it's like it changes you the only way to really wake up yeah you know everyone can say Oh live every day like it's your last well wha but until you live through something like this or I don't know for me until I lived through something like this it doesn't really make your man so should we go to the second day in the hospital yeah I mean the hospital days just start getting blurry ER after our first surgeries were in a hospital for total of five days in eight days I got up three days earlier they wouldn't release Kristen because she wasn't reaching a certain physical therapy benchmark that they wanted her to reach which is they wanted to understand for five minutes with that passing out but there was some intensity of the graphs that way that was very frustrating for me but essentially they didn't catch that Kristen's hip was fractured so she wasn't reaching this benchmark because she had a fractured hip and the worst thing you can do for a hip is make someone stand and put pressure on it that just makes it worse so she was saying ow my hip ow my hip I can't stand and told she was passing out for pain told me it was phantom pain from my femur surgery that I was just my brain was just thinking my hip but I was like it's such a sharp pain in my hip I don't know how it could be phantom pain but I just you just believe that offer you there the freakin doctors and so she's passing out from the pain she can't do this they're making her stand multiple times a day trying to do this test oh you can't do it today well you're gonna have to stay no one likes to be in the hospital you can go home you want to go home you want to eat not hospital food and that's a whole other thing very thankful for the hustle but everyone knows dude hospital food ain't fun and you don't have an appetite when you're on all those drugs that you just had a surgery so you're just like you're not eating it's not fun you have no one there I'm on top of which we could have no visitors so Kristen's there completely by herself because of coronavirus we prep Kristen to come home we have this big reunion she comes home and it's awesome and she's here for three days and the hospital calls and goes hey we were looking at those x-rays that we took and it turns out that we think she does have a hip fracture she might have to come in and get surgery anyways that was a very annoying thing she went back I look at this fractured the hip was fractured and it's called a non-displaced femoral neck fracture and what that means basically is it's basically the bone that is about to be at your hip joint so the doctor said this is an extremely timely surgery because if this crack gets displaced at all our gets any worse your hip joint is gonna die because this is the bone that lets the blood travel to your hip joint and you're gonna have to have an entire hip replacement if this gets any worse so she immediately when she got her x-rays had to be admitted to they said you have to go to the emergency room you're gonna get surgery in the morning and I was so sad that I had to go back into the hospital had to go back alone and get another horrible surgery but I was less scared cuz he told me it was a way less scary surgery I woke up out of that surgery screaming in pain it was the worst pain since the accident that I had felt and I was like why did he tell me this is not a painful surgery it was horrible and I'm still having so much pain in this hip it's still really swollen and masses but so this set her back two weeks now the clock restarts because it's been almost two weeks from the accident she comes back home and then she's having chest pains and so they have to emergency take her back in because she might have if the pulmonary embolism goes untreated which is a blood clot in your lung there's a one in three chance that you will die like it's very very severe so we go into the hospital stay there all day they run a million tests on me and they say you have a pulmonary embolism it's just a pulled muscle you can go home me and my mom are so happy and then right when we're out in the parking lot the hospital calls me and they say she's getting in the car yeah I'm getting in the car and they say yeah you need to come back in immediately because you have a pulmonary embolism on your left lung and you need to be admitted to the hospital till further notice because this is really serious associated go back so how do you gospel now for the technically fourth time yeah it's done it was horrible so many blood tests then I had to get on this blood thinner that was these shots in my stomach that Marcus had to give me for two weeks now we're home and life is good because we got two beans here yeah I mean that's not even the whole story there's so many decoder for getting Chi is it do you want to tell them about all the details we have a detail about you my brother sent me a video in the hospital of the next day when the police had dropped off our bike which was totally destroyed and I'll just play this video but essentially it's a video of camper sniffing the bike which she's never done when they dropped it off he just extensively sniffed the whole bike it was something happen this isn't right and you know in his head he's thinking Oh mom and dad go out on the bike they don't come home they've been gone now like for a full 24 hours where did they go what happened and then they drop off that bike it's all destroyed and it just like it just I just started crying because I was like that's the worst thing ever is to see your dog being like my parents are dead you know and I just thought about like whoa what if I have kids and like whoa what other people are thinking about like what happens if like Kristin had died like how I would feel or like vice versa like when you yeah it was just like all those feelings started you know just hitting me at once you know you see people sharing about traumatic incidents it's on social media always been like I wonder what I would do in a circumstance like that like what I want to share the whole story with people or what I want to stay private but in that moment when I was in the hospital I just gone on my femur surgery I was like I have to share that Jesus saved our lives with our audience and honestly y'all's messages got me through being in the hospital alone I would refresh I get like six new messages every second and I would just through all of them all night while I was alone in the hospital and it made me feel so loved they cared about and not alone and I've never felt like more connected to you guys in my whole life and just like I don't know what I would have done if I just you know it really lifts the spirits yeah so now our lives are way different because we're so active and we love just being independent and doing our own things and this has just forced us to let go of control you might think about life and just appreciate each other's company in it's been so frustrating at times and I just want to go outside and I just want to vacuum my carpets and just do like the little things that I normally do says no one just like the mundane things that you don't think about but take camper and honey for a walk like any of those things but you know it's gonna be you know a long journey to recovery ahead all of our family's been incredible all of the support on social media has been incredible all of the friends who just come by we've had friends who's like sent like so many flowers and post mates and like yeah yeah it's been great it's been really great oh my gosh Chris let me say this part I was in the hospital for eight days every day passing out three times a day dripping in sweat because when you pass out you sweat and like cold sweat my hair was matted like a serious dog mat I hadn't showered they like to wipe you down but not really but Marcus said that when I got home I smelled so listen to me when I say this they opened up to the door no I was on the very other side to announce that not exaggerating she opened up to the door and I was just like I was a Christian and then all of a sudden I just get hit with the whiff of like dude it was like wow I'm smelling this stink from that far away and that was the stinkiest thing I've ever smelled and it was from you and I can't believe it and I was like you're so happy to see you I remember and I just turn around sleep did you got a shower that day I was so happy to see you but that was so stinky no maybe I get embarrassed laugh after this that I've heard her fart in front of me for the first time I don't care I've known her I've known her for seven years and I never heard her fart she would always like doctors yell I've heard her speak excuse me I've smelled her farts like a couple times she's very very late cautious - I'm just smell when I'm just like and she'll blame it on the dog or so like I know that's you but then I finally heard it and we both knew and I was like it's okay dude it's okay like you can fart I because you're extremely gassy but you you have no poop at all like when you're on these drugs assess you just like I was like alright babe no I didn't oh you didn't oh you didn't do it okay we're gonna have a little fun in this video yeah I didn't fart in front you I don't care actually I did and I don't care it's because of the don't be mean to me no kiss me no something else too is her breath has been oddly stinky all the time and she's brushing her teeth that's fine I always have I always have where's honey you found a crunchy crunchy - our dogs have been extremely misbehaving lately because they know we can take very very disappear baby I think we're gonna wrap it up because we pretty much have

and I need to look young and nice and freshened up so I really don't hate it but it is too poufy on the side the thing is I've cut his hair once before and it turned out pretty good I think it looks good I think it looks good - it's definitely longer on the top but I kind of like it you know I don't know what happened to our other Clippers but in the move we lost them so I had to go buy new Clippers and they were all sold out so the only thing that they had was beard trimmer babe that's no kind of work well it's mostly for beards it's all in one trimmer it's all in one does it all so you're giving me problems already you went to my face and just get the feel for it so was it thousand dollars no it was twenty six bucks it was really go it's going on the ground what do you do is sponsored by a norelco but it could be I think it's gonna work do you have your clippers it's very lightweight which is frightening let's just shave the sides like like with this you know maybe you should watch a video or something before we get started are you sure you know what you're doing yeah oh my gosh babe this is your literal miracle what she always complains how I have long nose hairs here's the thing that everything that you triggered everyone's around video you're such a big fat baby everything that is a huge I've had a CEO that I'm like I'm entertaining good that's what I am I'm not a freaking baby Philips Norelco my favorite no me friend I've ever used all right let's see if you can get a brand deal out of that okay Philips Norelco I feel it know me friend we messed up

channel cut beep here three two one I need me to do that this isn't the first time I wanted to stuff you in a trash bag you see what I'm saying I'm reading a true-crime book I didn't even have to I don't even have to say anything you just expose yourself you're trying to act like you're so nice also are you freaking kidding me really don't mess up my hair actually this time I'm taking a whole entirely new approach to what I'm gonna do well whatever you think you're doing this is what you're actually doing well my approach you're gonna cut my hair like Great Gatsby oh my my my style is gonna be to be quick and to be confident and last time I was so nervous click click and that's what made it take so long so I'm just gonna Jupe Jupe Jupe get it done ready yeah leave it long on the top and just cut the sides okay do I need to get a clip yeah you need to get a clip I mean do it because I think I'm gonna do like this all right okay don't mess up my hair we're outside literally I'm going to shave it fully shaved three all the way around he mess up and I don't care cuz I'm down for that too but I'll just look like a twelve-year-old with gray hairs I don't know what that's the length you want I don't know wait I'm so confused I what I like to do like that or like this like this all right stop it freaking rich beautiful seriously don't watch a youtube video something because I haven't done it in two years sit down and watch a five minute YouTube video then really quick don't don't go oh I don't know what I'm doing I don't care that the cameras rolling and you're trying to be silly go watch a youtube video cuz this is gonna last for six months and what you do the remnants of this is gonna ripple the effects will ripple for six months the next person who cuts my hair are you the one who's hitting hair you have no reason to you stress how about this if it turns out horrible you can snip a piece of my hair no I don't want to do that I don't want to ruin your hair juicy real in mind that doesn't help me just just watching YouTube oh this is what happened last time big fat baby and she's like you're being a baby don't freaking wash it and give me my phone where's my phone I know exactly what to do now that I know what to do alright then trust me I do I needed just it was just nervous at first beginning nerves you don't go all the way up remember don't go all the way up you got it you got to stop it at the right point okay you should probably you should probably clip my hair you know I'm taking then just go grab some clips why do I have to say I think you should do this like this should already be done I'm so confident good Oh something that they told me oh you can good you know you talk to the barber yeah that's what with it the fact that it's even working for $26 and I'm assuming working well what do you think does it look okay you got to be my eyes bro like you can't just let this be good dude did you really just give me that uh it's strange the things that are happening but I think it's good you look like a hillbilly or something good I want the freakin mullet vibe give me the shape this I've gotten a lot off wow I'm really doing something hey babe leave the backlog I don't care anymore I want a hillbilly frickin really Bob bullet I want a hillbilly mullet the only reason I said I wanted to put you in a trash bag is because I'm reading that scary but there's no excusing that then yeah but I don't want people think I'm psycho I thought you were giving me a mullet dude you're cutting the back well okay I am going to stop this is honestly therapeutic and I remember the last time we did this video you were like every weekend we can do this and then we haven't done it first we'll check the footage I don't think I ever said yes check the footage because he did say that if this turns out good I think we'll probably always do this right I love this and this am i calling it's so fun to just a little lighter this is what she's doing give me it beautifies my technique last time too and I'm not bad stand for and you know what dude that's what you got when you married me she's doing this she's gonna into this where she goes and just kind of she goes like that she goes and then curls it let me just get a little more of the back and then I'll leave your mullet are we really doing a mullet well we can just do it too just see what it will look like he'll barely baby you really have to trust someone to let them cut your hair I know and that's why this isn't working so I didn't part out his hair very well it was kind of like jaggedy so what I'm doing now is fixing my mistakes see now it's perfect well now it's perfect and now we're gonna go from here how to well that's why I'm not beautiful they can't take it yeah that's why I'm the most beautiful person they got a deal with you every day okay new cut you know I didn't think I'd be that guy who like you know did like the classic like married I'm married jokes you don't but it's a rite of passage okay right it's it's a rite of passage you just do like you really I obviously love her like to the nth degree and I tell everyone how much I love her but it's like it's like such like you know when you like a girl in fourth grade and you like slap her I just got in the hair on campers back do you see that you see every time you're not filming she does something very abusive yeah he went laughs and sweat hang grab my chin okay so anyways like I was saying you don't slap her obviously because that's you know domestic abuse so you just slap her with your worry this is going in the video as people you're gonna trigger everyone hmm oh dude I'm down doing this as much anymore now I'm like worried I need the scissors I'm moving on to the next side we know what we signed up for this isn't gonna be the best haircut of your entire life but it's the memories that channel right mm-hmm whoever gets the comment with the most likes I will ship my hair to you let me look at you from the front we're just gonna end up shaving it all off to be honest cuz I think you have no hope oh happy day oh happy day when Jesus washed right now I'm feeling like the first few strokes you feel confident cuz it's like there's so much to work with it's like the finishing details that trip you up cuz you're like okay now this is like the part that you really gotta make it look nice right now I'm feeling good there's gonna be here every way perfect for the bird's nest they're building look at honey bee what is she doing she's laying there and if it's quite all right I need you baby do all the lonely nights let me get a Midway look at the reflection should I just rock it like this is it look kind of sick what do you think since rocket like this some guys welcome back to the channel it's Marcus John's dude I'm here at my crib with my wife she's freaking hot dude okay now I'm seeing what is the whole picture okay I'm very confused on having the back of your head what do they usually do leave the this whole thing long right see this is the part I have no recollection of I mean this is a this is an extensive haircut because it's very long yeah I should get paid extra I think I literally did get a bowl on my head and get a bowl cut back in the day like I would get straight up in Boca you just have the Justin Bieber cut that was in yeah high school or so well what it was is I just grew up my sideburns and he just let him go yeah baby yeah while I'm cutting your hair you went yeah that's not good okay coined this technique called the wiggling shoe and basically when you get up to those tiny long hairs you just wiggle and shoot them quick so they can't get away wiggling no don't do that Kristen because you're gonna bend the hair sideways and then cut it off shorter it's gonna make my hair jagged seriously think about it that just goes straight no we did it trust me I don't stop my head Marty's sick of this mhm I would not pay you I wouldn't pay you if I went to a barber shop you'd be like you're inexperienced and you you need to go back to hair school yes you say that I'd say I'd pay you on kisses and I'd say you're going to jail okay I think this is the time for the scissors all right wait I miss something yeah we're that now stand up and shake your head around so I can see my canvas I'm gonna have to do some real work on the sides because that is something else the head I think I need to almost like do like that all needs to go right here well you fade that down I I need to get a snack babe I got it I'll help you out no I seriously actually got it and I loosened it really a lot huh see this is exactly what I didn't want to happen oh I could have used 10% of my muscle to open that here I'll open this to 3% of my muscle I'm not gonna labs like 36 percent hello baby they do they know what's going on they're like mom is cutting cats hair she's so pretty right now mom she was having ear problems and was making her eyes water cuz they're her allergies and now she looks amazing Wow Harold my peanut butter okay I'm gonna go get this isn't   I'm ready for the real party to start [Applause] use one hand and use your other hand to come through and pull it up with your two fingers okay and don't just cut crazy like just do a couple snips let off and then look you know what it's like you are in a room with all the lights turn off and I can see perfectly and I'm telling you how to go and if I did it you would just run into every single inch of the walls and never find the door part it's like what do I do with it I just have to snip sip and blend blend but it just takes so long hey don't spray she's way too cute I never seen you so pretty little baby yeah I needed that I needed that snack come on Kristen no keep your hand on my head as if I move then you're gonna sniff way too much so keep your hand on my head lift lift it up I hope you put all of this in dude because this is ridiculous what she's doing it seems innocent but when you are the freakin head that's going sneaky sneaky sneaky snip snip and it's pulling your hair at all the direction she's just going it's like a friggin edge I'm not doing this you did this to you it's a great technique don't do it I didn't do it but it is simply put it in one hand only I have been I'm serious don't do that anyway put your hand on my head because you're gonna mess it up and this whole thing will be for nothing I actually want to have a decent haircut I don't want to have to shave my hair if you go too far in you will mess it up that's not an exaggeration so so we fully pay attention to what you're doing no I'm scared good tensions have risen good hey this is actually looking great and faded when I really don't take my time I'm done with this you don't understand how much effort this is it looks great though this last 20 minutes just cut all that far all right do you want me to really do what I do when I go to the barber this is what I really do I stick I stay completely silent and I close my eyes and I just let them cut and then I if they ask me a question I'm like I'm from Florida and I just I'm like polite but I just kind of let them know I want to fall asleep I I couldn't relax but now I'm just like who cares that we've been at this for 45 minutes and if it's tight I'll see you on the other side you know because I'm too tired for this though just good night for a little bit see and I have to do all of this they probably have special tools to do these parts with right Marcus mm-hmm they don't I'm from Florida and I'm gonna tip you well I'm gonna be so nice to you but look dude I'm from Florida I'm closing my eyes on you do I need the Clippers were they where's this Clippers I left them out here Ron let me think while my eyes were closed and I was doing nothing I put them I don't know really where could they have gone oh shoot man yep you definitely uuf my hair I can tell right now I can totally tell you AG headed me all the way up and that should not look like that yeah he messed up look at my hair and tell me that you didn't mess up you egg-headed me and I and I promise you after this I don't care I'm taking the three and I'm gonna do it myself so do whatever type of creation you want cuz I really I really don't think you're coming out of this tunnel I'm close I'll see you on the other side though I'm from Florida babe I didn't egghead you Marcus understand I hope I hope you didn't I want to look for the Clippers this is exactly what you did last time and then at the end you said it's not bad yeah of course it's either gonna be one of the two so you know wow you did pretty good it just took you two hours or it'll be like well it's about I thought I'd be so I'm hoping it's the first and a haircut cannot be okay a haircut can't be like a haircut oh come on come on you either got a good haircut or someone did something wrong ones and zeroes babies on and off it's code the world we live oh yeah but I know what it is I'm about to code me a hot child with you though oh now you want a child after you've been yelling at me yeah I'll just I'll just say mommy ain't touching the Clippers though where are the Clippers is the question I don't know Kristen did when you got me the watermelon did you put it in there when you went and fetched me my snack did you lose the Clippers so tell me about your wife I'm from Florida she beautiful yeah I mean it's just from Florida so you can figure that out I can already tell people are gonna hate you in this video no one edit me to look like a freaking angel I'll put a halo over my head right now things are looking pretty good okay I'm just gonna take some length off the back Marcus yeah just fade it in I'm trying it's not as easy as you think you know when I talked to the barber I don't ever hear them saying you know this job's pretty hard we just say hey can you do this and they say yes well cuz they're trained that's what I want to hear also there's something that you're doing very specific that is at the utmost of annoyance to me you are snipping the hair and then you're grabbing the last little bit and you're like I'm done and you rip them out of my head you go so like here's all the hairs you go rip on the last two every single snip and you know what - because you freaking feel it get ripped out of my head so I would say to the barber I wouldn't say anything but if this was really happening in real life and I was really getting this haircut I would do this I would after the 15th time I would do this just that just enough to where they were like was he looking back did he need to cease it was he trying to look at the oh maybe he was looking at I shouldn't something's wrong I'll let me just take it easy I have to go find the Clippers okay are you saying like what if they were like some like you know cool duteous glasses okay so we lost the main reason for the video the Clippers we did yeah were you I've that's been glued to this chair maybe campers laying on them go see if honey grabbed him are they in your kit yes they are yeah really yeah I really do need I didn't know this I have them there's a microphone in my pocket yeah and they were in my right pocket I thought it was the microphone you're joking I swear it were in my pocket I didn't know why didn't you tell me because I didn't know until you just said are they in your pocket I checked where's this Clippers let me think while my eyes were closed and I was doing nothing where are the Clippers is the question I don't know Kristen did when you got me the watermelon did you put it in there don't we lost the main reason for the video the Clippers we did yeah are you nuts been glued to this chair you love hats so it's not a problem if your hair looks a little point that's what I love when my barber says when I'm leaving okay you came in here with the head you must love them this is how I know I know I know I did not say let's do this every weekend check the footage okay I really just fix things I am very a lot more confident right now good I feel like you're cruising that's what we like I feel a lot better because I went around with this I kind of faded everything in and now I just need to go and do the back with the scissors just grab it shoop shoop shoop blended in the front and then I think we're gonna leave this all long long ish and then maybe snip a little in the front and I think we'll be pretty good we're gonna go Great Gatsby on him I feel like I was feeling like a zero and now I'm feeling like uh eight I put peppermint essential oil in there what for your water markets to make you feel more relaxed the vibe was like going downhill like I I thought maybe we were gonna lose us here but now the vibe is back the morale is high I feel good how about you like they say the workers always right we really pride ourselves here on worker service you know now customer service just work your service you moved you know I need you to look down and I need to focus for a second so hold sorry worker I want a big chocolate chip cookie after this I went ahead rub every 30 seconds on the thirty second look me too wow I am doing magical things and I'm getting annoyed again I don't have to trash my Shack I'm just kidding you know everything you do new it's a roller coaster you you're excited and you're like wait I can't do this and then you say I can do this and then you say oh I can't do this and it just keeps going until you finish and it's good or bad you don't know saying baby   my style is gonna be to be quick and to be confident weird daddy loves you daddy daddy hey I am your dad I live with my barb says here hold this I love you barb here it's just my neck - yet - your viber I'm after an hour and a half yeah no I'm just actually wondering after an hour and a half I would do that to a hypothetical barber yes well how long does your haircuts usually take maybe 25 minutes at the max and guess what they're cutting 80 peoples hairs a day that's right so that's what I expect out of you we should bleach your hair for fun yeah but it could never grow back the same once you and then just go ahead while you're at it and put a little here and then you're too cocky boy all you gotta do is growl at the camera I haven't seen any of these videos so I don't know how I'm like like this Marcus this must be like sexy like yeah Wacka shoes like this right it's like really like like that I couldn't think of a more masculine thing to do than to growl to attract to be a quintessential ebo attracting a female I would think that that is the actual worst thing that one can do but in the spirit of tick tock oh please please please cut that out I can't have that living on the Internet I want you to zoom my mouth of as big as you can on the screen and put a lion's roar behind it could you turn that way from me back how it's like out the bat is I don't know why it's puffing out like that I know because you screwed up no babe yes dude you're supposed to fade that and you spra I'm fading it that's why it's still so long I'm gonna take these and go all the way through my hair if you don't fix this in 30 seconds that's my ultimatum really I don't think you're gonna like that what happens in 30 seconds he has issues his own issues that cause me horribly that your hair has calyx in it that I don't know how to work around hey what if I screwed your hair up that'd be hilarious I my desk I don't really think can I get you a mirror and you can tell me exactly I don't want to look at it I want you to just fix it I can hear the comments now Marcus is so mean no linen my name just cut that out you triggering tit babe I am trying you understand that trying my hardest and it's hard it's very difficult Phillips to it cool you move every two seconds when I'm trying to fade out this issue man so obviously I'm trying my best I think when you see this you're gonna be pleasantly surprised I hope so I just my biggest wish is that you will like it that seemed genuine so how much length do you want off the top that much all around is gonna take another hour then then screw it man I'm just gonna be great okay great wax beard oh babe come on trust me it's not as bad as you think and you look honestly so good when you had that buzz cut me like if you hate it you know you look really good with a buzz cut so like you badness well be nice goodbye me miss me anyway huh let me go get some styling gel are we done you seem depressed I'm just I've been sitting in this chair for two hours I've been standing okay I'm putting the gel in because he wanted to keep it long I would go for a short cut but considering how long this took I know I get it it doesn't mean I love you any less it just means I'm need to get out of this chair okay I love when my barber says okay what are you three to one so what do you think it's funky I have to admit I think you did I think you did a better job on the first one I'm not gonna lie you took it a little high but it doesn't mean I don't love you so you think it's horrible I think it's not good last time you thought it was good I know you think it's bad you I'm gonna do a fake alternate a different one that says I love it yeah so what do you think I love it really yeah it's the back that's just funky this is not right at least I didn't do like something horrible Kristen what do you think take yourself out of it how do you think it looks great I think I'll just leave it like this literally trim the top now to fade it in okay I'm just gonna clean up his sideburns in the back of his hair I can truly say I gave this my all this is like if I was like make me a sourdough bread right now you'd be like I don't know what to do you like I'm trying my best but I don't know what I'm doing it I'd be like I guess and I'm like I just do it do it quickly and I want it done perfectly in 30 seconds or I'm gonna scream and if they feel depression I feel sad and angry didn't want to walk I totally understand but but but the difference is the sourdough bread is on my living it's walking around a piece of sourdough bread that is the ultimate difference so don't eat my bread I'll make you a sourdough bread after this and I'm sure it will be horrible but I won't be like but but I won't be like hey I can I can cook sourdough bread maybe I will but then I won't say this put that on your head and with it for four months I wouldn't do that look I agreed I agreed I agreed to this video and I knew that it could be so bad I I knew that I could be bad but that's why I knew I'm just gonna take a three and just go flink but it's good I mean it looks better than how it looks before and honestly my hair before was just ratchet I would I would give your other haircut a ten out of ten for your first attempt and in real life like a seven out of ten which is great for a first-time cut ever I would give this connect for okay your hair was so much longer worth three I had way less guidelines as the last one I told you to watch a YouTube video before and I did no you did it do you want a snippet piece of my hair no I'm gonna snip a piece don't don't do that to yourself really why I don't know I felt like punishing myself it'll look a lot better if you just spend a little at this point let's spend the freaking time we've been here for three hours at this point so I could have made an airplane in this time an airplane like you mean you kind of think in a flight no I think I could have literally
