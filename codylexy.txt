what should i do okay wait there's a  better one  there's a better one about mother love     what's up everybody welcome back to the  channel this week so today we wanted to  switch it up and try something a little  bit fun and different where we  asked you guys what you're going through  in life what your problems are whatever  you need advice on and we're going to  give you our  perspectives but the his and her version  we had you submit some  dear cody and lexi questions about your  current struggles  some of them are petty and silly and  some of them are  extremely deep and intense so we're  going to get into it  in order to keep this kind of  nice and keep you know the table open  for both of us we're going to get an  equal amount of time so  30 seconds each to address the problem  and give advice  and we may agree we may not agree i was  feeling we may not agree on quite a few  of these  i guess we'll find out i told everyone  submitting questions and asking for  advice that their names are going to be  kept anonymous so we're going to stay  true to that  and just start it with dear cody and  lexi so before we start giving you guys  our advice we want to let you know that  we're partnering with geology on this  video which is a men's skin care brand  that i just started working with and i'm  super excited about  for so many years i was winging it with  my skincare i wasn't taking it too  seriously  even winging it you basically have never  had a skincare routine before this  yeah yeah basically i mean i would go  from like this moisturizer and like  once in a while but recently as i  started getting older i started taking  it a lot more serious  you deserve your own skin care routine  so the great thing about geology is  their skin care products are tailored  right to your skin type you get to take  this online diagnostic quiz  and it will let you know everything that  you need for your routine so first you  start off with just a trial set and  their products work best as a set so  start off with your 30 day trial and  here are the four products that i got  so i have the everyday face wash the  vital morning face cream the repairing  night cream and the nourishing eye cream  after the 30 30-day trial you can  actually continue with a 90-day set of  supplies of the products you love the  most  you can subscribe and save or you can go  all the cart and just use the ones that  you like you're in total control  i love it because the quality of the  products is so good and it doesn't  require a lot  of time which is a big deal for me and  it gives me more time during the day to  do what i want to do all right guys so  if you want to give this a try we'll put  the link in the description and if you  want 30  off just use my code right here and go  grab it for yourself  all right let's get to the questions  shall we yes dear cody lexi i am a saver  and my spouse is a spender  what do i do if i want to save money  okay this is simple and i don't need the  full 30 seconds  if you're sticking to the budget and  you're spending 10 percent  of what you earn it's fine  and what lexi and i do is we have our  own spending budgets  so regardless of who's making more i  still got 16 seconds i'm chilling  as long as you guys have your budget and  you have each of your spending budgets  every month and you stick to it  you're good sounds like the other person  doesn't want to follow the budget  you have to follow the budget i'm sorry  okay it's my turn  i actually agree with you on this one i  think if you don't have a budget you  need to make one  and set one and that actually sets some  parameters so that we know  like what's okay for each person to be  spent in within each category whether  that's personal spending or on vacations  or whatever so once you come to that  agreement you can hold one  another accountable and just know that  you've both agreed before  on what to spend and when it comes to  who makes the most money  if you are a married couple yeah  if you're a married couple you both  share money that's right it's  both of y'all's money that was good  now we had to sign of course as you guys  know  yes how do i tell my boyfriend i don't  want him to visit me every single  weekend  at college it's like everything you  gotta have all things in moderation  including bae in moderation in the  beginning before you get married while  you're getting it popping you know  he's harsh dear cody and lexi there are  some habits my partner has that i'm  worried i won't be able to live with  forever  oh what should i do okay start the clock  okay so it depends if the habits are  harmful or not  if they're harmful habits like you need  to address it you need to be honest with  them it's all about honesty that's how a  relationship  works um but sometimes when you love  somebody on the other hand if you love  somebody so much  you're kind of willing to deal for life  with  the stuff they do like how beauty leaves  her clothes everywhere  i feel like i'm being personally  attacked every time you answer a  question it's a random question  i would say that you should approach  your spouse or significant other about  those things and see if they're willing  to put in a little extra effort to  change especially if it's something  petty like cody said like keeping your  clothes on the floor or something that's  really simple like that  um otherwise i would say i agree with  you  if it's like deep foundational habits  and issues  um that you're not going to be able to  overcome or that you can't see past  then i would say time to nix  okay just say that just do that okay  dude i'm sorry i'm laughing already dear  cody and lexi  i'm having trouble getting along with my  mother-in-law  do you have any tips i feel like  my significant other's parents are  always in our business  wow i got this question a lot actually  you want to take it away first i'll take  it so let me be the first to say that  your family is your business and i know  it's great to have loved ones around but  you and your spouse  are a family unit on your own and it  doesn't really concern other people  what's going on so you need to create a  boundary with both sets of in-laws i  think that that's super healthy  but it's also great to have them around  and i think that when you spend some  time  apart and also time together like the  whole just  the whole relationship is just a lot  healthier when you get married  the person that you're married to is  your ride or die so you need to  team up with your partner and talk to  them about what's bothering you  i think that whose ever parent is  causing the issue or a part of the issue  the child needs to go to that parent  whether it's with their spouse or  without whatever's most comfortable for  you guys  to have that conversation so it  shouldn't be just you  fighting it out against your spouse's  parent you guys need to get together as  a team and just have an  open conversation and then of course  like cody said create some boundaries  boundaries are great yep dear cody  alexia i'm going into college and don't  know what i want to pursue as a career  please help i think we're really good  people to answer that question  let me just say when i started off in  college i thought i was going to be a  pediatrician  and then i went into broadcast  journalism and now i'm an actress so i  just think  as you grow over time your interests are  going to change your career path might  change  and that's okay i think no matter what  you study in college you'll be able to  in turn  use it for whatever career that you want  college just grows you as a person  in general unless you want to be like a  doctor or lawyer then yeah you probably  need to decide because those things are  specific  i agree with it i think that if you  decide that you want to go to college  and take that route  it doesn't need to be super strict  unless you're doing one of these extreme  career-focused jobs so i am not doing  what i got my degree in i got my degree  in english but with the film studies and  and i knew i wanted to get into  entertainment i think that we have these  passions but i think that you use  college as an experience  use it to learn communication skills  with professors and whatnot that's what  i took from it  social skills like getting involved and  meeting new people and i think that  college is super valuable for them  dear cody and lexi how do i not feel  pressured to have babies after being  married for a few years  wow we can definitely talk on this one  so you're going to get the pressure to  have kids  from day one like day after you get  married you'll get it and then  it's going to just start exponentially  going up every year that goes by  but honestly it's between you and your  spouse it's whenever you guys feel like  you're ready  um i mean look we're me and lexi have  had the discussion  several times throughout our marriage  and we're still waiting for that right  time but i feel like it just comes down  to the two of you and what the vision  you have for your  family is you know it's like if you want  to have be an older father or an older  mother or if you want to be a younger  father younger mother you got to decide  like  where in the timeline of your marriage  you want to start having kids  i think that was perfect i'm not going  to add anything else good job  no way you're not going to say a word  have babies whenever you want  and tell everyone if you can wait they  can wait  that's my advice dear cody and lexi  what do i do with my significant other  and friends and family when our  political views  do not align it's been really difficult  i don't know about you guys but i'm the  type of person that can  separate the politics from the person i  can love you  i can be friends with you you know what  i'm saying i'm just i feel like i just  like to be above it all  there are some people in my family that  we don't always see eye to eye on  politics but i feel like it's just  people  hold that to a too important and too  high of a standard in my opinion i think  that we should all just love each other  if you believe this  if you believe that okay i think we all  need to just calm the heck down and just  love one another and if you're  especially if you're family  that's your family and don't let things  like that get in between you and your  family or your loved ones in my opinion  i think that sometimes it's best to not  have political conversations with  certain people when you know that um  one side or both is not willing to just  like listen and have a conversation  where you can have like a meaningful  conversation  some people are just very you know about  their ways when it comes to politics and  that's okay  but maybe it's best to just create some  boundaries and say hey i love you  we don't see eye to eye on politics so  we probably shouldn't talk about that  together because i don't want it to  drive a wedge in between us  and a relationship okay dear cody and  lexi my fiance wants to move in  all his sports decorations into our  small  apartment what do i say so does he want  all his  sports decorations on display i have  questions  um that's a no from me and  um the reason being is because i want my  house to be like cozy  and have a certain feel and vibe and  sports decorations are not that vibe i  would say  give him a closet have him hang it all  up in there  and once you can get a man cave he can  go take it away with that yeah i was  just going to say that too i think that  let the house i feel like let a house be  neutral  like when you go in there like don't let  don't let the decorations  tell like us like a certain story that's  why i do like the idea of  a music room an office room  a man cave room so it's like you go into  there and you're like okay this is where  this business gets taken care of so i  would have to agree with lexi  sorry guys i don't know that you need  that in the house  because i wouldn't do that personally  but i'm not a huge sports fanatic  necessarily so  just talk it out compromise it's a hard  thing  it's a no for me oh this is a good one  dear cody and lexi when i get married  should all my bank accounts be joined  i feel like yes but my boyfriend doesn't  think so  i think all that paper needs to be  interconnected with yours is mine what's  mine is yours what's his is yours once  you're married  that's one of the biggest things that i  think creates a  team money is actually like one of the  biggest reasons for divorce and so i  feel like if you're not on the same page  i feel like if you don't have joint bank  accounts  i feel like that can lead to a lot more  issues because you want to have  transparency with your spouse as to  where money is going  and that just opens the door by having  them separate um for there to be  issues in my opinion i completely agree  guys you got to be transparent and no  secret paypal accounts i don't have a  secret paypal account  so i think you gotta you gotta let money  work for you guys you gotta  both of you should know where every  dollar is that's how lexi and i are we  keep track of our finances we have a  budget we like to stick with it we're  serious about money because  you can really utilize money and have it  work for you so  work together as a team you can have  joint bank accounts you can have  separate retirement accounts is fine but  just know where everything is and i  think that you guys will be better off  now about that secret paypal account you  little secret do you cody and lexi  advice with  living in your in-laws they're always in  our business  help move out as fast as you can  i know it's hard um we've been in tight  financial situations we have friends who  have and i totally totally get saving  money  but get on a plan because i personally  believe that you  need to as a married couple have your  own space and um you don't need anybody  getting up in your business  okay unless you're asked for advice you  don't need it that's 100 true guys i  mean listen do whatever you need to do  if you need to get on your feet  but really try to limit your time  because once again it's that exponential  chart of it getting a little bit hectic  and remember your in-law is going to  always try to favor  their kid so it will by default be  unfair for the other one so it's not  going to be balanced so  try to do whatever you can to get your  own place and  have a normal family and visit the  in-laws when it's time to visit the  in-laws  one last thing i want to say living  under your parents roof at any age  you're expected to follow your parents  rules  and that's just because it's their house  but as an adult  that's just really hard to do and i  think it causes a lot of issues  dear cody and lexi how do you ensure  togetherness with your partner when  people change over time  like you know how they say you're never  gonna be the same person as you were  five years ago  so what if you get married and that  person becomes different five years from  now  has that happened to you guys yeah i  feel like lexi and i have changed a lot  in the past 12 years but  truthfully i think it all comes down to  what your relationship is founded on and  for lexi and i it's our faith it's our  it's our belief in god it's it's our  belief in family and family values  so lexi and i can always fall back on  that we can always fall back on  the bible and our faith if things get  weird or if we change a lot and we can  keep each other accountable  and i think people are going to change  over time but i think that when you're  both  centered in one thing it's really hard  to really take this  weird like off course path you know  you're essentially going to work  together  uh and kind of stick to what your values  are  i think people will inevitably change  over time and  um from my experience when you are  putting  a lot of time and energy and feeding  into your relationship the people that  i've known who are married who have done  that  have pretty much always grown together  it's when  you stop putting that attention into  your relationship  that i feel like you're less in touch  with who that person is and who they're  becoming  so instead of moving together as a team  you start moving you know separately  and so i would say um keep god first  keep each other second  facts dear cody alexia this is for your  advice column so i wrote a book  i finished it a few months ago during  quarantine i have been writing it for  almost  two years wow now that it's done i'm too  afraid to put it out  wow it feels scary to put myself out  there how do i overcome that  as an artist i can say it's flipping  terrifying to put yourself out there  i've stood in auditions in front of  rooms of very important people  wearing my heart on my sleeve and  performing and i've shared poetry with  you guys and every single time i do it  it's scary  but you know what it's always worth it  you have to realize  that not everyone's going to like you  there are going to be people who think  that you're terrible and your books  terrible  but there are going to be people who are  moved by your book who are moved by your  art and moved by your work  and even if that's just one person it's  worth the risk of vulnerability so i say  put your book out do it yeah i believe  in you i agree  too guys whatever you're working on the  hardest part is that initial  right it's just getting over the fear of  just posting that first video  releasing your first song your first  book applying for that job  and having that first day of work that  you're so nervous about that you're it's  a new place for you  you just gotta get over the first time  guys and then for me with releasing  music it was  releasing that second one and then uh  that third one is it going to be better  than the other two whatever  now i feel like we can just lexi and i  are getting more and more  confident in ourselves and our abilities  and our art so  it takes some time but you got to get  over the first one so that you can  get that second third and fourth wave of  confidence and it comes with time i  promise you  i want to say one thing i know i already  have used my time but um  as an artist you've got to stop being a  people pleaser it is so  important it will be the most  life-changing thing if you're proud of  the art you're putting out  that's all that matters because at the  end of the day  you know that's that's all you can stand  by there is always going to be a critic  so as long as you  appreciate the art you've done a great  job  do what you love do the stuff that you  enjoy doing you will attract  the best people that you want to attract  is the people who love and appreciate  the stuff that you do  dear cody and lexi my boyfriend and i  have been together for seven years and  he won't put a ring on it  we're 24 and 25. what do i do listen man  i don't know what the deal is  for me it was finances and i can  understand if you want to get right  like before asking the question but  looking back man i spent too much on the  initial ring i probably could  i was not confident because i was like  oh i don't have enough money and i  needed to buy this ring and i think a  lot of guys get stressed about like the  ring and wanting it to be nice  dude the girl loves you and is gonna  love whatever ring you get and you can  upgrade the ring later  i know this is really focused on one  thing but i think man if she's the one  and you know she is  don't let anything hold you back because  if you got a struggle in the beginning  if it is financial  you can get through it together you can  you really can that's my thought  wow seven years is a long time and i  just feel like at this point if you  haven't had an  open conversation on like are we getting  married  are we gonna get engaged yeah you  probably should i think that  as a woman i had this idea of like  oh he's just gonna propose that i'm not  gonna even know and it's just gonna be  so romantic and it's like  no sometimes you have to actually sit  down and have a conversation and be like  hey  i want to get married i mean are we on  the same page here how are you feeling  about that  because i feel like it's like this weird  unspoken expectation  and sometimes you have to lay your  expectations out on the table because  if this guy's not going to want to marry  you and you haven't had a conversation  about it  i think that you both need to get on the  same page to make sure that the future  is heading in the direction that you  think it's heading  derrick cody and lexi how should we  decide dinner when we're both  very indecisive cody always yells at me  for being indecisive about dinner  honestly flip a coin  that's all i have to say pick two places  each of you pick a spot flip a coin and  then just go  a lot of times when i've been really  annoyed at cody's dinner decisions and  i'm just like  i don't want to go here after telling  him he can choose whatever he wants  i end up really liking the food it's not  that big of a deal  if the two of you agree to the coin flip  you just  stick with it it is what it is like  chick-fil-a  chick-fil-a or all right chick-fil-a or  in and out like let's say that was the  coin flip  no feelings no like oh it lands on in  and out but  i don't know no no like whenever it  flips on  you you gotta get it i thought yesterday  we actually got really annoyed at each  other because of this exact situation  and then i just said to myself i can eat  what i wanted in the future but the  problem is i usually don't know what i  want  so you just have to pick well let's see  i wanted some mediterranean right and  then i was like  well is it are you gonna like it she's  like if she gives me the  yeah that ain't yeah that's  you know the language guys like after a  while with your girl like you start  knowing the language and when you know  it's not  what it's what it is you're just like oh  god i gotta figure out what the heck she  wants you know  but i always do whatever you want  those words are dangerous and she'll  sometimes say  whatever you want and bro you better  have the right answer  all right guys so we hope you love this  video this was actually really fun for  us i think that we should do a lot more  of these  should we ask cody and lexi i think we  should especially like in this advice  lane because there's so many couples out  there that like  it's not even that you don't know what  to do it's like you just want to simply  know  what other people experience and what  you would do so it's not like you're  asking us the ultimate people who know  it all because we're just out there  living life dealing with our in-laws too  yeah we're not perfect either and um  so obviously like just it is what it is  we're just doing our best out here too  but we have been together  for 12 years and we've been married for  coming up on sick so i think we have  like  a little bit of little understanding and  it doesn't always have to be  relationship questions it can be any  kind of question  yeah life i like the finance questions i  like the money questions ooh  dave ramsey pops up dude i become dave  get out of debt  pay off the house don't be stupid  i love a man guys thank you so much for  watching this video we want to do more  of these if you're not subscribed to  cody and lexi  click subscribe all right give this  video a like if you guys liked it and we  will see you guys on the next one we'll  see you guys  you  oes something smell good a lot of  hillary oh he farted  are you serious oh  that is so disrespectful  that is so disgusting did i keep eating  this he basically farted on my  gone or no look at this smoke coming in  front of your  face all right so talk about what we're  doing this evening because it's gonna be  quite the evening you want me to do it  okay she's still enjoying your food it's  gonna be an evening  with cody and lexie guys and uh right  now we're actually about to go take a  walk with grover because  you guys know what he does at around 4pm  every single day he starts to look he's  so anxious he knows we're going to play  pickleball yes we're going to play  pickleball which i've never played  pickleball  so i'll probably suck like most sports  and athletic activities  no i believe in you thank you  so after pickleball hold on let's set  this down that's a  horrible do you really want me to have  17 chins in this video  hold on let's let's let's try this babe  this is  all right this is better now the pov is  you guys are tiny and we're like your  super tall  friends you're gonna give yourself the  good lighting wow  i'm glowing i wanna glow  there

show you guys  um but yeah let's go for a walk let's go  an evening  with cody and lexi     we're here at the pickleball courts it  looks a lot like  tennis but it's not can you show me the  pickle ball  oh it has holes in it okay is it kind of  like ping pong on a bigger scale  ping pong meets tennis it's a cool  microphone i think  so what are the keys to being good  pickle pickleballer don't ask me i'm not  very good  really i feel like you would be good  we're okay  but the thing is like we can't really  run to get it  or else our legs hurt so it's like we're  like half as good as we could be  you know what i'm saying well then i'll  play against you yeah you're my opponent  i'll probably be worse than you even  though you're not mobile we'd make it  just sad  marcus is actually

cozy  vibe so we're super excited  and we're super grateful because this  video is sponsored by olay  which you guys know is one of my  favorite brands so let's just get to it  all right what's first shower shower  time my first priority after a long day  is getting my makeup off and getting  into comfy clothes  and i don't know if any of you ladies  are the same way but i literally would  rather  get in the shower to take my makeup off  than wash it off in the sink  i just feel like it's so much easier so  that's what i'm gonna do  and babe i know that you were saying  that our water bill was  super high the last one that we got from  ladwp  and i really think that we should save  water this evening are you are you up  for it  it's for the good of our budget anything  to consider for the planet we try to  keep it real for you guys and  i don't know what your shower looks like  but we have a lot of  just soaps and just products all over  our bench in there  and i would like to sit on this but we  can't even really sit on it  you are not geriatric you don't need to  sit in the shower what do you do just  sit in there  think about your day you don't have to  even imagine it okay it's a  very relaxing experience  hey what are you doing over here you  little turtle  slapping stuff all right friends i just  got out of the shower  i'll usually comb my hair i then add  deodorant on  after the shower before bed and then in  the morning i'll put it on again  i don't know if people really do that  but i do it just makes me feel  fresh for the evening after i shower i  always love to put my skincare on  pretty much immediately because i don't  like to put my skincare on right before  i go to bed  i like to kind of let it soak in so it  doesn't get all over my pillow and  really  like gets in there and works so i always  put a little bit of  lip online i used a little bit of toner  and now i'm just gonna put on  my current favorite moisturizer so if  you follow me on instagram  um you know how much i love olay i talk  about them all the time my mom used  their products growing up my tiamati  used their products growing up and so it  was just a natural transition for me  because they're so affordable and their  products just really work  to start using olay from a very young  age they just came out with this new  olay regenerist retinol 24  max nighttime moisturizer they  have a retinol 24 moisturizer already  but this one's called max because it  actually has  20 more of their unique retinoid complex  um which means that it's packed to the  max like it's called  so i've been using this baby for about  two months now what i love about it  is it gives 24 hours of hydration which  like i said i definitely need during the  winter months because my skin gets super  dry  it has 24 hours of potency which means  the active ingredients are actually  working on your skin for 24 hours which  i love to know  and i feel like it's made my skin so  much brighter and smooth it just feels  really hydrated and good when i wake up  in the morning this smooths wrinkles it  evens your skin tone  and it just makes your skin feel so  good and i like to put it all over  and all over my neck that's it i've been  keeping my skincare routine really  simple  all i do is an eye cream after that and  we are done  and not only does that save me some time  right now but my skin's been really  loving it so  i'm gonna link the olay retinol 24 max  moisturizer right in the description  i really think you guys are gonna love  it so make sure to check it out now that  we're all comfy cozy  which is the best way to be i really  like this on you yeah it's like a little  nighty shirt with buttons i love it  we're finally gonna show you  our bedroom here's some footage of what  it looked like before  it was just very bland i would say  and we have to spice it up in here a  little bit and here's  the now  so let's walk them through the changes  that you made one of the things that i  got that i  love in this room are this  framed picture um pro tip  if you ever get a photo and you need to  get a custom mat done you can get that  done at hobby lobby it's like  15 it's a game changer john taught me  that  and i got this little light above it  from amazon  you can change the color you can make it  cooler warmer  and this was actually a very ugly color  and i just spray painted it  i think it was like 25 i'll link it down  below if i can find it for you guys but  i have to show you the coolest part  it has a remote baby wow so you can just  set the mood at night you can turn it  off that's cool  next thing how to switch up the bed  sheets  um i got these from parachute and this  from parachute they're linen  absolutely love we had never had london  sheets before and i'd heard that they're  all the rage so i had to try them out  and we've been loving them so far  i did this like terra cotta color which  i was a little bit nervous about in the  beginning  but i think it was the choice because  basically i can just switch out  this fitted sheet and these pillowcases  to white if i ever want to  and um yeah just keep it cozy you know  so this is my side of the bed uh as you  can see lexi changed out the light  fixtures here they kind of  hang and mount off the wall so it saves  a lot of space on the nightstand which  is cool  speaking of the nightstand i got this  book by matthew mcconaughey i've been  reading lately green lights  really cool story about his life and  navigating through the entertainment biz  which is what we're doing right now in  life  uh we have a tall mason jar of water  every night before bed so you gotta have  the  coaster it's pretty cool because lexi  was able to run this  light switch right here so i can just  reach over easily  boom last but not least we got this new  rug  um if your room is too small to have a  full-size rug like ours is  get a runner put it at the foot of your  bed it actually looks  real good and we didn't get any new  furniture but we did get  this new gigantic round mirror which i  feel like  is such a vibe right it's just  you know simple cozy  and you can check your fit in it which i  think that's what's cody's doing right  now  very important i put on essential oils  every single night before we go to bed  so i actually keep this little water jug  it's a really big part of my bedtime  routine and  what i'll do is about an hour 30 minutes  before we get ready to go to sleep  i'll just fill this up  i add a couple drops of my favorite  essential oils  rc is usually on repeat it's like a mix  of eucalyptus and tea tree  and a bunch of other really good things  that help me sleep     how do you feel about the oils  and i just want to put my face over  where the nice smoke is coming up and  just breathe in  you know what i mean i feel like it hits  stronger that way well you are welcome  to do that  it's like i smoked it you know  it's not approved by the fda grover's  bed is in here even though he doesn't  sleep in there he still  sleeps with us which how i don't know  how we allowed it but it's it's gone on  this far  so i guess until the little boy passes  he'll be i'm sorry he's going to live a  very long time can you talk about that  we also have his water bowl in here  whole fam likes to stay hydrated you  know  yeah he gets out of bed randomly at  night we're like what is he doing  anyways here  i used to not be this way but i've been  getting this sweet tooth  after dinner every night and it's  because of this woman  right here and so tonight lexi's going  to be making me  my favorite sugar cookies and  they're pretty simple right they just  come in this pack and there's no  they're homemade and they're a lot of  work but  i thought it was the one thing with the  christmas tree they're literally  pillsbury cutting back  funny story about these when i was in  eighth grade  i used to make these almost every day  before school so i could take them to  school  i don't know if you know the story babe  and one morning  my latina mom had left the toaster  inside the oven she was storing it in  there oh my  god and i preheated the oven to make my  before school cookies  because you know that's what you do and  i caught the oven on fire the toaster  was on fire inside the oven and i didn't  know what to do  so i caught our fire extinguisher  and i sprayed which  if you've ever been around a fire  extinguisher they smell  so bad and the amount of sulfur that  they put out is like  impossible to clean up and  my mom almost killed me so anytime i  make these  i think about that beautiful memory oh  man preheating  the toaster who does that i swear to  never put anything  other than baked items and things that  go in the oven in the oven after that  all right so she lays these bad boys out  and i eat about  five of them my family always dipped  them in sugar  growing up aren't they already  sweet though like yeah but you know  the gorbitas gotta do it     so if it's not too late lexi and i well  hello sir  we will uh lay on the couch in the  living room here  and we'll watch some netflix or some  amazon prime  or some cool hbo shows but  one thing is for sure lexi will not be  awake  by the end of this cody and i actually  had a conversation i think like three  days ago  and we talked about how in our 12 years  of being together  we have only finished four series  yeah all the good content i'm missing  man  it's crazy always because i am notorious  for falling asleep i just like  i'm sleepy i'm tired i can't hang  after like 10 p.m all right so what  shows have we finished  breaking bad which is impressive because  i had a lot of seasons that took like  two years  that's so many yeah i was going to say  like that was the first three years and  it took that long for us to finish that  we finished limited series  very easily especially like the two to  four episode ones  we just watched the queen's gambit that  was really well  i fell asleep on episode two but the  rest of it was really good  and then we've seen season one  of big little lies that was pretty good  we should watch season two sometimes we  tried we watched the first one i think  the funniest thing is we used to watch  house of cards and i would fall asleep  in the intro because the intro is like  seven minutes long  and yeah i would be sleeping before the  show actually even started  but we did finish all of westworld yeah  we did  we finished westworld it did take about  a year but we did finish it it's so  intense how can you even fall asleep  during westworld  so right before bed is cody's favorite  time  of the evening the floss routine  this man flosses more than anybody i've  ever met in my life and  i think you gotta just go ahead and show  them how you floss with no hands  the reason i don't have any cavities is  because of the flossing they say it's  more important than brushing so i  take it very serious i take it more  serious than brushing teeth  if you floss and not brush it's actually  it's actually better you're kind of  approved for bed  oh if you don't brush but i'm just  kidding i don't not brush i always  brush but i always floss hard okay so  show us the no hands please  so we're all waiting for okay so i'll go  in the middle  bottom he does this in bed by the way  top  this might be the worst sound left side  bottom left and you can control it you  know oh no  you can control it  you want me to move them or what i mean  they're just here and we don't use them  we don't sleep with them  babe you can't hate on the pillows that  is what looks good  and cozy they're just there  men grover come on bedtime bubby  we put the rug at the end of the bed  because it makes him less scared to jump  up  but sometimes he still won't do it come  on  good night last thing i wanted to show  you is our new alarm clock that we just  got  because it's very cool so this is what  it looks like it's a sunrise alarm clock  so basically  it wakes you up by simulating a sunrise  which i think is really cool it helps  you wake up a little bit more naturally  and then you can also set it for bedtime  so  if you press this button for 60 minutes  it'll play this rain noise  and it'll go from this bright gradually  gradually gradually to complete darkness  to help you fall asleep  and it's been a godsend especially since  i have not been keeping  my phone by my bed um it's a big change  that i made  during this time of staying at home that  i feel like it's been super helpful so  yeah i love this thing all right guys so  it's time for bed we're actually going  to bed this time we love you guys so  much thank you so much for watching our  videos if you haven't  subscribed to our channel yet please  subscribe to cody and lexi give the  video a like if you liked it and we will  see you guys on the next one we'll see  you guys soon  bye guys  hat's going on everybody welcome back  to our channel today and i think it's  safe to say  that 2020 was one  of the year you didn't curse so guys i  think we can all agree that 2020 was  pretty difficult there was some lows  which is why  lexi and i thought it was important that  we do a video today about  our top 10 favorite things about 2020.  yeah so we're kicking off the list today  with  the sponsor for this video i laura we're  so grateful to them and  i am grateful because i'm a new woman  thanks to the isler london line and lash  black 2 in 1 lash adhesive eyeliner this  is a product  that i love and i've been swearing by  lately and basically it's exactly what  it sounds like  it's a lash adhesive and an eyeliner and  one  and it's actually the reason why i wear  falsies at all right now  all right so i'm going to show you just  how simple this isler london line and  lash is to use  all you have to do is shake well before  using and apply it like you would  any regular eyeliner until you get your  desired eyeliner look  so you can use line and lash with any  lashes but today i'm going to be using  the eyelure london  luck silk marquee slashes these are a  little bit more glam than what i  normally go for but i feel like they're  perfect for the holidays  you're going to go ahead and trim your  lashes to the desired length  then i like to add a thin layer really  close to my lash line  one more time just to get that adhesive  on there so i can  pop my lash on easily then you're just  gonna press down on your lashes to  secure  and that's it so easy i just can't get  over how easy this is the application is  smooth  they're vegan friendly cruelty free and  they stay on all day long i'm telling  you i've cried with this eyeliner on  and it didn't bud wanna ask me why i was  crying  oh you're asking for me i was watching a  really sad movie  i'm gonna go ahead and link the idler  london line and lash right down below if  you guys want to check it out you're  going to love it especially if you're  newer to falsies like me and you need  something  easier you know not too high maintenance  right  okay so one of my highlights from this  year was building the chicken coop  together  we were in our you know project mode  because it was so early in the pandemic  stuff that we're like okay we're just  gonna be home i guess and we just  filled our time with doing little  projects and that was one of the  projects we did  but what about the eggs oh  we're using visual aids in this video so  here are some  fresh eggs from our hens and in the  beginning the hens weren't laying  remember  it's almost kind of a waiting period  when you get hens because they gotta get  comfortable  in the new coop yeah i mean we're the  only people in  l.a with laying hens you know  i don't think that's true probably not  there's probably some other crazy people  too  another one of my favorite things that i  just started this year and i feel like  it made such a big difference  was journaling journaling has just made  me  feel this is my journal by the way i'm  hugging it  journaling has made me feel like i can  actually  process my emotions and i feel like i'm  the kind of person to where  i just go go go and sometimes i don't  actually  think about how things in life are  affecting me  so getting my thoughts and feelings down  on paper has been so helpful  in terms of processing especially this  year with everything that's gone on  i feel like i've needed to really sit  and take a moment  to figure out what i'm thinking and what  i'm feeling so yeah i've been journaling  for  six or seven months now and it's been  great i  think you should start you want me to  start journaling  yeah she's she's lexi's more of a  writing type like  physical writing with like pins you know  which now  now with phones there's you know you can  type things out  maybe our great grandchildren will read  my journal one day  and they'll be about 20 20. they'll know  about you in heaven and about you no  recollection of me  because i wrote nothing down i wrote  about you in this oh  wait it's like a diary kind of kind of  basically it's just a way  to process your emotions sometimes i  talk about my day  sometimes i talk about my  you know fears my anxieties  that makes her smile i think it just  it's a good thing  looking at you makes me laugh honestly  okay i'm done  another great highlight from this year  was i don't know if it was because of  the pandemic because before this we were  already in a very good habit like  starting january 1st was doing our  morning devotionals  in the front room yeah every morning  together and  i feel like we really stuck with it and  uh here's the devotional you guys have  heard us talk about  um this devotional before but it's it's  been so great to do that together it's  been a way that we've been able to  connect  and we're not always reading it together  like sometimes we're just in there  together but we're doing our separate  reading and  you know reading from you know whether  it's like the you version  like cool tap through daily devotional  or if it's from  uh 40 days but either way it's been a  great year that we kind of got in the  habit of doing that and starting off our  day  you know in the word in a devotional  yeah it's made such a difference  especially this one i feel like  this if any year could steal your joy it  was 20 20 so it was just great to go  through this and get  you know tips and tricks and sound  advice  on how to keep your mindset on all that  is good on all your blessings  on you know everything that we have to  be grateful for so  highly recommend this i will link this  down below as well if you guys want to  check it out because  it's definitely giving me joy you know  when we've needed it the most the next  thing that  is one of my favorite things of 2020  these sweatpants wow  that's the most random one i would say  i'm wearing sweatpants right now  the cute sweater it's been that year um  this has been  alexis's year of sweatpants and you know  what  i wouldn't change it for anything i  always love being cozy  now that i have an excuse to be cozy  since i'm home  all the time i'm not gonna hate on it  it's been a blessing and i have  definitely  increased the number of sweatpants that  i have specifically  my favorite brand is blue and gray these  are the soft  these are like an angel breathed and  these sweatpants were created that's how  soft they are and um yeah  i love them i have like i think five  different pairs  and i just wear them on repeat i'm mad  that i didn't wear sweatpants because  that's what i do wear every day  and i wore pants just for this video and  it was the first pair of pants i wore in  2020  just for you guys you should feel  special i dressed up for the video for  the occasion  this is all we get dressed up for these  days yeah we're really just trying to  make ourselves look presentable for once  i'm excited i'm excited to put on some  you know falsies and like look pretty it  reminds me that i have potential  hey if you have potential what are you  talking about so you're still  beneath the cute you know i i've learned  to love myself  raw and love myself glam  it's been a journey but i do i really do  i i  i love what the good lord gave me so  this is another 2020 activity  where if i would have said it any other  year you'd be like okay  who cares but i gotta say that  our walks together as a family like  around the neighborhood have been like a  nice  exciting like breath of fresh air you  know like it's  it's one of the few activities that you  know we could do  you know when at the most locked down  times  in los angeles and so it was really fun  to take you know  a little boy come here guys we're sorry  he actually was napping  so he's just now waking up right now but  we're grateful for you  bubba did you enjoy walks together as a  family this year  you did okay go back to bed  it's crazy to think that one of your  favorite things of 2020 was  walks but i think that that says a lot  about what a year it was  and you know it also speaks to our  gratitude for  our health and one another we didn't  drive each other crazy this year  yeah and apparently that was like a huge  issue with  couples and families of course a lot of  like  pressure was put on couples who  you know a lot of these couples you know  the who work regular jobs we get to see  each other every day and i think that  that has helped because we're used to  being around each other  but i guess the couples who work most of  the day apart  were now together for the first time in  their marriage for like a majority of  the day  i you've got to be tired of me and there  were times you know where i was a bit  tired i'm just kidding i don't get tired  of you  the other day i was like well we won't  get into it  never mind wait wait what you're not  going to give him the sauce i was just  going to say  i you know it's been a very emotional  year for me and so the other day  i was crying and then cody made me laugh  and then i was laughing and then i  started crying about something again  and i was like i am i  am not easy to live with right now  like i had a moment where i  fully saw and accepted that and i was  just like  i'm grateful for you you know yeah i'm  great with me it's okay you can cry  sometimes     oh man it's just been one of those years  and i feel like  um we we did well in the environment  which was couples being  in the same household because that's  what we're used to being and  for a prolonged amount of time and i'm  i'm super glad and for all you couples  out there who've weathered the storm  and even the single people who really  had to  keep it harder shout out to you guys man  it's been one of those years but you  know what  it's gonna get better it's gonna look up  soon  the next favorite thing of 2020 has got  to be  my cooking obsession so i've always  loved cooking  but this year was the year to hunker  down and make lots of home-cooked meals  and that's  exactly what i did asked me if i watched  julie and julia  and then bought julia child's cookbook  and then made  beef bourguignon i don't even think i'm  saying that right  for the family because i did okay and  ask me if i've made gwyneth paltrow's  roasted chicken about 20 times because i  have  and also the favorite online website for  recipes  is half faked harvest and um my sister  kristen and i have cooked  so many half-baked harvest recipes  together and they've been incredible  we've fried feta we've made orzo i think  we think that we're chefs now  and honestly y'all have reaped the  benefits of this so  cooking for me is just relaxing unless i  don't feel like doing it in which case  it's not  so but when i do it's like my favorite  thing it's therapeutic  and i just i love to eat i can't lie so  she does  it's been great it's one of my favorite  things of 2020. now i'm going to juggle  some of these eggs  and if i drop them no do it no no  do it don't get that egg on this so  listen if egg explodes i'm  so sorry what are you going to give me  if that explodes  ed okay ed  n  oh shoot okay i was just playing i know  but now  you want to see it so i'm just i'm just  letting you know there's two ways an egg  can explode  it could hit the ground up dropping or  it can slap into the other one in air  are you sure you want to still  attempt are you sure yeah  i'm up for the challenge of watching  this happen  okay  wow wow  you did it how many rotations was that  was it  yeah great job okay guys so another  thing that i'm super  excited about for 2020 was i released my  first music project  and i'm wearing a shirt that actually  says the title of the project it was  called  relentless and i just released it a  couple days ago you should sell that as  merch  yeah i should it looks good if you guys  like this let me know  in the comments below um but anyways  guys i've always just released singles  so this year i actually  you know it was it was during this time  where i realized hey  instead of doing what i've always done  let me switch it up let me do a project  something more long form something  that's kind of more cohesive  so i hunkered down in my studio room and  i made five songs  all about kind of my story so i've  gotten some amazing feedback a lot of  you guys have actually already checked  out i've been promoting it on my  instagram  and uh it's a project i'm super proud of  guys so if you can i'll put the link uh  in the description but check out  relentless my new project  and uh it's seriously so good it's so  good and i'm so proud of you  um i feel like it really tells another  side of your story and you're just so  talented  i mean cody won't brag on himself like  this but he self produces everything  which means that  he makes the melodies he actually  creates the tracks  in his computer people like me don't  know how to even describe this because  we don't know how to do it but he like  he makes this music out of thin air the  melody  and the song the lyrics and  it's like amazing to me it's like magic  to see  this new creation just like no song oh  yeah here i made this song  yeah like that's so cool it's such a  huge accomplishment and i see how hard  you work  day in and day out on your music and how  much of your heart and soul that you  pour into it so  thank you i'm proud of you for  supporting my dream go give it a listen  you guys it's available to stream  everywhere  so i know you all have spotify apple  music  all those things just go give it a  listen we'll link it down below  the last thing that i want to say that  i'm so thankful for  in 2020 is you guys seriously  um social media has always been kind of  a creative outlet for us  creating videos and you know posting  parts of our lives online  and just especially this year between  chris and marcus's accident and the  pandemic  and everything that we've seen in the  world racial injustice i mean i've just  seen you guys show up in so many ways  for your own communities for our family  and um yeah giving us an opportunity to  still  be able to do what we love even during  really uncertain times so  thank you we love you guys we're so  grateful for you  i want to wish you blessings and good  health and joy  and peace and all of the good things and  we  are excited for 2021 it's gonna be  better  yeah i mean like it's gonna be great  this year we were like oh 2020 best year  ever  but we know 2021 is not going to be  worse  than 20 20. i mean i i shouldn't even  say that because  wow but i believe 2021  will be so much better than 2020. all  right guys thank you so much for  watching this video today if you guys  liked the video  give it a thumbs up if you're still not  subscribed to cody and lexi subscribe to  our channel we hope you guys have an  amazing christmas this year and we will  see you next time  see you guys soon i have to start this  video again  honestly i'm excited and grateful about  my coffee machine that i bought  because that was the best thing of 2020  that happened to me  what's  going on everyone  this is the craziest video we've ever  made i think  how do you say it you just tell them  what happened okay i'm just gonna say it  all right okay so as you can tell from  the title of this video  it's true it's not a prank we're having  one  we're having one now explain how did  this happen  okay so i know a lot of you guys are  probably really excited we are extremely  excited  i have no idea what i'm getting into  uh so it's gonna be a fun journey that  we're gonna get to share with you guys  of having our first  baby it's so crazy to say i think for  cody and i  it's um it's so surreal obviously we're  really giddy filming this video i think  it's just so difficult to wrap our minds  around the fact that  we are actually gonna be parents and i  think it's exciting to tell  all of you because that's probably the  number one question we've gotten  over the last six years of our lives  and um we're just we're really excited  and we feel really blessed  so yeah and we were shocked  when we found out as you could see from  that little clip of the reaction from  cody at the beginning he was just  you're speechless more shocked in my  life and i'm sorry that i didn't have a  more emotional reaction but it's  it's not the same reaction as like  seeing your wife come down the aisle  it's a different  emotional feeling when you find out  you're having a kid it's for me it was  just utter  well i was shocked too and we're not  going to share that entire video because  i want to keep it special for us  but um just to give you a little play by  play of how  the last lots of months  have been going for us for cody and i  we've always wanted to have kids  and we have always hoped and prayed that  we would  you know be able to have kids we always  wanted a family but  you know living in los angeles and  working in entertainment  for me i was really you know trying to  figure out  whether i should spend more time  focusing on my career  or we should you know start having kids  and we prayed a lot about this  back starting in like june and without  getting  into too many details about it we got so  many signs  from god pointing us in the direction to  have kids so  finally i got off birth control and  two months later we found out that we  were pregnant and i had been told by  many people  that it could take a long time  to you know get pregnant after getting  off birth control so i thought it would  take  months maybe a year i have friends that  you know have been trying for over a  year so i was like oh it's  it's gonna take time and i was actually  comfortable and confident knowing that  that it wouldn't  be so soon i was like it's gonna you  know take some time and it's gonna be in  god's timing  well god shook us to our core once again  because two months later we found out  that we were pregnant  and when i went to go take the test i  wasn't expecting  it to be positive even though i was late  i just wasn't expecting it to be  positive so i didn't even tell cody  i was like i'm just gonna take this  because i've taken tests in the past  and i say don't just don't tell me  you're getting the test  just tell me if it's if it's a baby  let's freak him out a little bit so i  was like i'm not pregnant so  i'm just gonna take this test and then  it was positive  well actually that's a lie it was half  positive  and it was like i didn't know if the  test itself was just messed up literally  it was the top half of the plus sign  and i used every ounce of p in my body  to take that test  and so i had to wait over an hour  to get enough back so that i can do a  second test  and the second test was the test that  actually physically says pregnant  or not pregnant and i think i got like  seven drops out  and i was like i don't even know if this  is gonna work and the sign popped up and  it said  pregnant and i could not believe it so  i couldn't keep this a secret from cody  so um as soon as i found  out i started coming up with a scheme  plan to tell him  and i told him and we were both just  like  i was asleep when all this testing stuff  was going  on so she obviously was a bit tense  that entire day but i didn't really  notice i just was kind of going about my  business  uh and then she told me and then here we  are  and i was just i've never been more  shocked  about something in my entire life you  just don't understand  the level of that news  until it just hits you right there it's  exciting but it's scary you just feel  like oh my goodness  are we ready for this and um  more than anything we just feel really  blessed but i i think it still  hasn't hit us so i'm 17 weeks right now  so  i'm finally in my second trimester and  still i like we look at each other some  days and we're like we're having a baby  but recently you've been seeing it yeah  a little bit okay i'll show you guys  it's been popping a little a little bit  more  so but in the beginning it doesn't you  just you know  the truth but you don't see the proof so  you're like  okay yeah she's but now i feel like  recently i've been  seeing it with my eyes i'm like oh  that's mine  like it's happening you are the father  um i won't talk about it too much in  this video for the sake of it  you know being super long but i did have  really bad morning sickness  um for months and that's  kind of why we you know have been more  absent on social media  and i you know haven't been posting as  much  because it was just like i was doing  everything i could to just  get through every day and i think that  i'm someone who  is you know active i'm such a doer i  feel like i'm always doing something and  during that time period i would have to  just lay on the couch  all day it was crazy so  i definitely underestimated morning  sickness  and i know that it comes at varying  levels i know that there are women who  have struggled with it  so much far worse than i had and some  women who are totally fine like my mom  was like i was never ever sick  she's one of the best ones um but at the  end of the day it's totally worth it i'm  finally starting to feel better now at  17 weeks which  thank you god because wow i just like  i just didn't feel like myself at all  and i just couldn't  function it was so so wild to experience  that but  totally worth it and cody did such a  good job of just  being there for me taking care of me and  when you're the husband there  it's just there's not much you can do  but like sit there and just get them  water or whatever they need so that's  one of the kind of  sad things about seeing it but at the  same time you know it's all going to be  worth it  one of the most exciting things was  going to our first  ultrasound i was really excited for that  and um also wanting to know like  is there just one baby in there  it's like one of the biggest questions  that you have just want to make sure  that everything's okay  and so going to the first ultrasound and  hearing the heartbeat what was that like  um it was fast it was like the speed of  like an edm song like 140  ish bpm how did it make you feel  i felt great it was healthy and it's  alive  and it's i felt great so it's just  it's so cool it's so cool and you know  of course i've been following along with  the apps that tell you  how big your baby is and we watch the  video every week as each week turns on  like all the different changes  and just to see that there is a human  being a human life forming inside  of your body it's like you see pregnant  women all the time your whole life  it's so normal and then when you  actually  experience it you have this whole new  perspective or like  this is crazy like it's a miracle  i can't understand it i can't wrap my  head around it i'm so grateful  and it's just it's surreal  it's crazy and we know we've been  getting lovingly spammed by you guys for  so many years about when  you guys will be such great parents and  it's just so crazy that  here it is and and now is the time and  i think we're both a little bit nervous  and obviously i want to  i've looked at a lot of friends who are  dads around me and i just want to be  that i want to be like a great dad and  like  learn as much as i can um and what was  so amazing  is the reactions from all of our family  members and we told them and we need to  follow up and we need to make another  video about that but  just the amount of love and joy that  it's brought people  beyond us with this news has been just  just so kind and just so amazing and so  great  so amazing i'm so glad we were finally  able to announce this week  and i just can't believe that we're even  filming this video  um it's been so hard to keep it a secret  for the last couple months especially  since we share so much with you guys and  with our friends all the time  so i'm glad that i don't have to hide  the bump anymore you'll see on my  instagram there's pictures of me like  covering it in every way that i can and  um just to be feeling better and you  know  to just see all the love and  congratulations  and well wishes we've gotten from um  our online family has been really  surreal  and overwhelming and wow i just it  really  moved me and made me feel touched so we  feel like this baby is  already so loved and um  i just wow it's it's it's here  so many of you guys chimed in on our  instagrams because we did you know the  big announcement there  and uh so many of you guys were saying  like how many years you have been just  supporting and watching us and then this  is just like  opening up a new chapter of kind of our  relationship and we just want to say  thank you guys so much for the support  and  obviously we'll be making more videos  about  the next steps of this journey and we're  so glad that you guys have joined us  and uh continue to support us through so  many years of cody and lexi  i know we'll get a lot of questions  about this we don't know  the sex of our baby yet so um  we are planning on finding out i didn't  do the blood tests  so we're gonna find out at the 20 week  ultrasound and i'm sure we'll do some  kind of  reveal or something at some point um  but yeah we we don't know and we don't  care  what we're having we're very excited and  super happy either way  i'm excited to know but i just what do  you think  it'll be great either way well we'll  have to go more into this but  the signs point to one more than the  other but we'll get into that should we  tell that full story  late yeah we'll tell you one day all  right guys so if you're seeing us  for the first time please subscribe to  our channel if you guys like the video  please like it we got a lot more  fun exciting life stuff coming down the  pipeline so thank you guys for sticking  around and we will see you guys next  time  what's up everybody welcome back to our  channel this week and if you didn't see  our last video  we announced that we are having our  first baby coming later this summer  so today we we sat down and we said why  don't we do a video  and tell everybody what we didn't expect  about being  expecting parents yeah it's honestly  there's so many changes  and there's so many things that i  thought i knew about  but i was shocked to find out either i  was wrong or  um just you know new things about  pregnancy that i had never expected  we're so excited to tell you all the  things we didn't expect about becoming  parents in this video we're so grateful  because olay is sponsoring this video  and um you know we've worked with them a  ton in the past and i love them so i'll  talk a little bit more about skin  care as we go along because i feel like  that was one of the craziest  biggest shifts that i had to make out of  anything  obviously guys there's going to be a lot  more lexi  changes than me because she's the one  having the baby one of the biggest  changes  that i had to make that i was not  expecting  is changing out all of my skin care and  when i talk about all of my skin care  i'm literally not using  any of the same products pretty much  that i was using before i got pregnant  because there are a lot of things that  we use on our skin  like retinol and aha bha  um just so many different chemicals and  products that are totally fine and safe  to use when you're not pregnant  but that can actually affect the baby  wow  so when i found out i was pregnant i  started doing all this research because  immediately i'm like okay  i want to make sure i'm being as safe as  possible and obviously it's so important  for you guys to do your own due  diligence do your own research ask your  doctor if you're pregnant i'm not a  medical professional  um but i was really excited because  i loved that some of my favorite tried  and true brands actually had  pregnancy safe skincare that i could  still use  you guys know i love the olay retinol 24  max moisturizer i talked about in a  previous video  and so i switched it out since i can't  use retinol  for this olay regenerous collagen  peptide 24  and this stuff has honestly been amazing  i always thought i had to use like  harsher chemicals on my skin in order to  make it look as you know  glowy and radiant as i want it to but  this is kind of a miracle in a jar  this stuff has the highest concentration  of pentapeptide which is a molecule that  actually starts working immediately and  penetrates your skin  whereas other collagen moisturizers they  have these molecules of collagen that  are actually too big to even  penetrate your skin's barrier i was told  that being pregnant ages you by like two  years  so um this stuff actually helps your  skin's  natural aging and renewal process it  just helps you know reduce fine lines  and wrinkles  and hydrate and all the stuff that i  need right now and i love that it's  fragrance free too i just feel like  you know right now i'm trying to stay  away from fragrance and all that kind of  stuff so  if you're looking for a great  moisturizer highly recommend this one  you know when you're pregnant you expect  your skin to naturally be  glowy and look amazing but honestly the  fact that i had to stop using so much of  my skincare cold turkey i felt like it  really messed with my skin because i had  been on my skincare routine for so long  for the first couple weeks there i just  like didn't know what to use  and wasn't using much of anything i  started breaking out  i did not have the glowy skin that  everybody talks about and i was like  what's going on but it feels really good  to find  like products that finally work again it  feels like you're starting from the  beginning  on finding your skincare routine which  is so overwhelming i was like  at ulta the next day trying to find  stuff and get stuff up at the store  and i was like on the online website  it's like what can i use  so anyway that's definitely been an  interesting part of the journey because  i just didn't expect that so one thing  that definitely changed was  lexi has been sleeping in a little bit  longer than usual  a lot longer than usual because she's  always the one that gets it before me  i always wake up she's not there i know  she's in in this room doing the  devotional on the couch and i'm just  like sleeping  i need nine hours of sleep you're in for  a rude awakening  no pun intended i'm screwed and i know  what that i am  i had heard about the morning sickness  but the tiredness was something that  really was like whoa it's no joke  and what do you always say about it i  call it cooking it's cooking  you know cooking a baby sorry fellas if  you're listening to this  um i mean it's really not that big of a  deal but  um one of the craziest things about  finding out that we were pregnant that  was totally unexpected to me  was that i had cramps and i had like  normal period cramps that's why i didn't  think i was pregnant because i had  cramps that felt  like the cramps that i get every month  you know what i mean  so no one had ever really talked to me  about that  and it was just so shocking i know that  it's probably different for  every woman and some women probably  don't experience this but for me  i have had cramps  since i found out i was pregnant before  i found out i was pregnant  up until you know still throughout the  week sometimes and i'm 18 weeks right  now i actually went to the doctor once  for it because i was like this is weird  this isn't supposed to happen  and she was like no it's completely  normal and i was like  and on your one side you were getting  like pain and you were like what is this  pain only on the one side and she's like  oh that's just  part of yeah round ligament pain  and so uh yeah all the aches and pains  and the weird things happening  you just don't expect it it's crazy this  actually does a number on your body oh  even our dentist when i went in to see  him  was like they used to have the saying  back in the old days have 10 babies  lose 10 teeth because he said the saliva  in your mouth usually regenerates your  own teeth  but all of that goodness is going to  create your baby's  bones and so your teeth and your saliva  are not regenerating and protecting your  teeth anymore  aka your teeth can completely go to  juicy land if you don't take care of  them really well  so naturally you know as new parents you  hear about morning sickness but what we  didn't know was it was gonna  extend most the time and especially in  your first trimester  past the morning oh way past the morning  i mean calling it morning sickness  for me personally felt like such a dirty  lie  because it was like seven p.m and i  still was nauseous  i woke up in the middle of the night and  threw up a couple of times like  it was just whenever it feels like it  sickness  and so that was so crazy to me because i  just expected like okay  if i'm sick i'm gonna be sick for a  couple you know hours in the morning  and then feel better not so lucky  you also hear that you know every  pregnancy is different and that's true  but i thought that my pregnancy  would look a lot like my mom's pregnancy  because she is my mother  and that's not true she didn't have  morning sickness or any sickness at all  with any of the three of us and  unfortunately that did not genetically  pass down  so man so also your  your your tastes have changed right yeah  when it comes to food and even  the coveted the most coveted guys i  haven't talked about this yet  this is gonna disappoint people it's  very disappointing i'm sad to say it i  never knew that not only would you know  food in general make you feel sick but  you could have  complete changes in your taste buds  when you become pregnant aka  i did not drink coffee  for three months because  now let's let's let's repeat that  she did not even crave it  oh not only didn't create the thought of  it the smell of it  would make me nauseous it would make me  want  to throw up i could not even make cody  coffee  because the smell of it made me so sick  now if that is not the sickest  joke on planet earth that me the biggest  coffee lover  would no longer be able to even smell  coffee  without having to run to the bathroom is  absolutely crazy and i didn't know that  your taste buds  like you could hate something that you  normally  love like your favorite food can become  your least favorite thing that  is mind-blowing to me and then we we  went to get krispy kreme donuts  one night which is you know a great  treat for everybody  and we all you know had a donut or two  and lexi was saying that the donut  tasted  sour what i took a bite of the donut and  i was like  ew these donuts are bad i was like  they're sour  something's wrong and then everybody was  like and everybody was like huh  and i was like guys you don't taste this  it's sour like these taste rotten and  they were all like these are the best  things we've ever tasted and i was like  oh my taste buds are completely  just out of whack it's so weird other  things you learn  i know and i have had cravings i've  craved orange juice  and like super salty olives  something i think it's really important  to talk about that i don't feel like a  lot of people talk about that was  actually  very unexpected to me is the initial  reaction  to finding out that you're pregnant so i  know everybody's in all different  situations when they find out they're  pregnant  and um we actually had been  expecting to get pregnant at some point  within like  the year but um when we found  out you know you usually see videos of  people like  crying from joy and being so excited and  thrilled and freaking out  and i think i was shocked at how shocked  we felt  yeah even as you know a couple who have  been together  for it's gonna be 13 years this year  we've  coming up on seven years of marriage we  felt like like okay  i don't know if we all felt ready ready  because i don't know if we ever could  but we were like kind of mentally  prepared  and still the amount of shock and  honestly a little bit of  fear that i felt um throughout the past  couple months and just  the questions of like oh my gosh life's  gonna change so much  it wasn't this like immediate crying  from joy  experience and i didn't expect that yeah  my reaction like i said in the last  video it wasn't the same as seeing her  come down the aisle  where you're not prepared for that type  of emotion  it just it hits you and then like you  have to cry like i just there's like not  like a button that blocks your tears  when you're when you're  a new husband but with this it was just  utter shock  and like i i apologize if my reaction  comes off  as like scared but i was just like  i was just so shocked that i was like i  did not know  this was possible like it it really  works  you know i don't think you have to  apologize though and i think that's the  point i just want to say like if you  find out that you're pregnant whether  it's unexpected or not  and over the course of processing that  you maybe feel  a little bit sad or a little bit lonely  or scared  or shocked i think all of those emotions  are normal because  you're stepping into such a different  phase of your life  and it is a huge life change and of  course it's a blessing  of course it's something not to be taken  for granted um  but at the same time i just you know  it's okay  to feel all the different emotions and  um i don't think people talk about that  enough so i think it's just really  important to say  feel the feels you know and the feels  are going to be different like this was  the finding out feel and then there's  going to be the baby's hear  feel like and then those the babies  growing up feel like there's  the parenting experience is such a  spectrum and this is just the tiny  piece of the beginning for us so we are  yet to feel  a lot of the feels yeah and we're  obviously so happy and so excited  um but it's it's an intimidating  yes it is and so  wow i didn't expect that so we we  have the ritual of course that you know  every new expecting couple has where you  get the  app and you every week you watch the  video of like what's going on  but the biggest thing that we've learned  was how  fast this baby gets formed  and i know nine months is a long time  like i understand that is a long time  but like when you break down  each trimester and each month's changes  you're like  whoa a baby's getting cooked  by her at this rate that is just  unfatting  it's just crazy because we're not even  halfway and  we've seen the baby's lungs are formed  the heartbeat  was like so strong already at her first  appointment  which was at eight weeks which is  absolutely crazy  um we used the what to expect app and so  it kind of tells us every week how far  along you know the baby is and all the  different development stages  and um for this past week it was telling  us that our baby  can hear our voices now the ears are  fully developed and  it is starting to understand and  recognize my voice  which is crazy and so when you when you  it's like teeth buds are forming and  ears like  it looks like a real baby in there right  now which is so  crazy i just thought i don't know i just  i guess you just don't think about it  until you're pregnant but  the development stages and how fast they  occur  from the time your baby literally looks  like a tadpole  to being a baby it looks like a baby now  it's a miracle all right guys so these  are some of the things we're learning  about this new experience if you guys  like this video give it a thumbs up if  you're new here i'm cody  this is lexi and we will see you guys on  the next one we'll see you guys soon  thanks for watchin  this is actually a very interesting question that I've been asked before in private but now we're going to ask incomplete what's up guys welcome back to our channel we're here with our besties once again Stevie and Sam they went to the gas station and brought over smack bang yeah it's a gas station mukbang that word makes me uncomfortable but I'm happy to be here so we also decided to get some drinks of choice so I may pull through for Coby and Stevie and I usually my drink of choice would be an ice-cold coca-cola but I'm not gonna waste it on this video I'm sorry with pizza or with taco so I'll just stick with the pair yes it's a sheer delight no no you can't choose that we are doing and ask us anything so I posted on my IG and said guys ask us anything literally anything that you want to add that's kind of scary when you tell them to ask you anything it is not a theory I'm having coffee and that hot cheetos and coffee so someone's gonna pay them this is actually a very interesting question that I can ask before in private but now we're gonna ask them couple and I'm scared do you think anything goes in the bedroom not in marriage we're really starting with this let me take down the bread if not everything goes I'm sorry because that just ain't right okay what doesn't go who's naked more often you are you me 100 that really yeah are unique oh for sure me really no he sleeps naked and completely naked 100% I can't sweet make it for some robbers robbing your house why don't you die are you gonna pull out your pistol we need to do something innocent now like favorite Bible characters you know those little Instagram filters where it says like oh you're this you're that yes Kristen did on me yesterday and it was what Bible character on me are you I was the talking donkey which I that existed obviously read my life that's right it literally said talking donkey yeah remind us of the story Bible is that apparently the donkey in the Bible was getting abused and it and God allowed it to speak to to say top right and she was that donkey well these little games are being patrolled so obviously ben karlin if Dante a long time to like pit it was like to second deck doodoo caca donkey I think Kristen's friend who's a missionary got Jesus Christ who's gonna take the first bite of the Snickers and then who's gonna take the second bite you know what I mean so don't it sound like you want to be the first is that a communal snack I've been wondering if I could take I think you can have it dude okay I'm gonna take a big job better take the bike so how do you guys if you want to know how each of us as couples deal with fights for us online we get a lot of questions like do you guys even ever fight it's like who doesn't fight do you guys know couples who don't actually fight because that to me is a red flag you have to have some kind of conflict every so often in your relationship because that forces communication right so for us you know the things that we fight about it's nothing on like the moral level in terms like the foundation of what we believe in so we're not like butting heads on that stuff which I feel like is the most important stuff that you have to have solid but the things that we bicker about the most are work-related because we work together so it's just we sometimes work on at different paces you know of the day so like one day I'm feeling it I'm just like going to million my squat per hour then I'm like well Steve you should also be come on babe what's going on today you should be on my level and then vice versa and it's like we're not this same week and we have to understand that so there's a lot of the times we think are about business about deadlines about him to which I still have not forgiven him for we usually sit down and say look we just need to have a nice long tickle fight we're making us kinky forgive you our was not true you're really you're also quick to get angry that's true sounds like a great calm here's how we resolved it honestly sometimes we'll go straight to the heart of the issue and be like you need to do this and then the other person is like wow that really hurt me and then it takes longer to get over it then sometimes we just decide we're like let's not have a crappy day and what's just not funny yeah that's the easiest way to get over it's like never just other than like less than a day like I've never seldom do we go to sleep mad at each other oh yeah we gotta sleep net yes it was a collar about you guys we what do we fight about we argue a lot when we're in the car together because he always wants me to get him directions and I missed the turns and nothing makes Kobe more angry than when I'm on IG it's growling and oh um no but but we I don't know I think you know I'm a pretty self-aware person so I can just get like pissed off and fiery for kind of no reason someone is a patient person I know them you think is me and John and Chris macaca do you guys really do this video together enough she is so patient like you're gonna be a great mother one day thank you well I try and that's something I'm gonna have an oarsman patient I'm not patient when it comes to like things that I want to get done for myself a career things and in that kind of way I think if a patient with people yeah um but anyway we argue we argue about stupid stuff mostly same thing it's never like on a moral ground level it's more so just like we just get annoying that each other like normal people Cody what has pissed you off more than anything with her well I think that sometimes you know she doesn't really put things away right away oh yeah I mean and she will leave things all over the house and I will find just coffee cuffs like in my car you know there's still like she won't put it in a to go she'll just take a coffee cup and just take it on a ride pretty dang good to go against that what I've been doing lately that's been ticking Lexie off is I won't get the trash out of the trash can and I'll forget to put the bag back in social helping in the trash and it's just like the plastic bin why is it the dead stuff like makes us so angry over a certain period of time I know and I'm like I just took the trash out because it's so simple to do and when something's a pet peeve it's usually about something simple like closing the shower curtain or putting a trash bag back in and do like in the dirty clothes she just leaves out or leaves a coffee cup in the car last week your little oratory nice clean one would you say your CV OCD you know all of the letters in your name oh I see actually go away get more organized I would say just off the bat but I also think like we have our stuff like makeup like just doing your makeup it's like 30 different products that you have to take out and then put that away and clothes and all those kinds of things I just like skin care products and it's a lot to keep track of so yeah I try to be organized but I sometimes like I have my room thank God that I get ready and that's like my office and sometimes it's a freaking explosion in there because I just let it pile up for days I'm weird I'm like my main house needs to be clean but then like my hidden room is that dirty it's my closet yeah the house me to be it is weird something to that but anyway we completely derailed from the question which is how we deal with conflicts and I would say um when Cody Megan arguments luckily we're pretty quick to get over whatever word mad about this is usually not that big of a deal yeah it's you like a small annoyance but if it is a bigger argument which we have had some bigger arguments that are more like actually like hurtful things that were upset about we usually like to link I don't like to talk about it right away cuz I'm the kind of person where if I'm really mad I'll probably say something that I don't mean and then I'm just like shouldn't have said that and he's like let it air out for a little bit so I can actually think about what I want to say and and be able to express myself not in the heat of like anger but in a more calm way so we can actually figure out because when we first got married it's like we were trying to figure things out right away I always wanted to just like squash it and talk about it and figure it out and then it would just turn into a bigger argument and it ever needed to be and nothing got resolved because we were just both in the worst mood and headspace so we like to just give it some time and then like come back and talk about it and I'll be able to like fully be like okay this is what accept me this is what hurt my feelings like this is what I'm upset about them and help you know be able to talk about it and I think in relationships like it just your emotional maturity it grows with time and yeah age so like if you look at the start of our relations just and we were all dating there are probably things that would bother us or we get into petty little fights where it's like now those kinds of things don't exist but right there's still sometimes moments in our conflict where that like I can be emotionally immature you know time yeah you know if they say something out of anger if they say something from a place that's like truly something they feel in their heart and I think that you can see those things by the way you're treated on the day-to-day I mean everybody every human being says something that they don't mean before so that's where grace comes in yeah and one of the biggest things that I try to do which code if I find is really annoying what I do is I always try to apologize as quickly as possible so I think sometimes something won't happen and I'll just be like listen I'm sorry like I don't want to argue even if we're like not emotionally over it yeah and he's like okay baby I'm like starting to still call her okay yeah okay beautiful I really like one said like him and his wife just make it a competition before they are going to even happen like who's gonna apologize first wow that's me and I think being able and who's gonna forgive first and I think that if you have that kind of mindset of like I just want to apologize and forgive and move forward it just makes those things easier because sometimes just saying it's the hardest part even if your heart if you want to just squash things it's like we all have ty so we don't want to be the first one to go to the person to be like hey I'm sorry yeah yeah yeah that's true especially because in a lot of the situations we don't feel like we're the one who's in the wrong no until you cool off and the I both kind of get back together as a team because that's our relationship is and then you work through but I'm not gonna lie there's some times where hormones get in the way I mean if you like our thoughts and decisions and you guys don't PMS is things dang it was down the door do we have a next question yeah let's move on Stevie do you want to take a bite of the Snickers cuz you can't honey I know you keep staring at it yeah it's Snickers left untouched it is across you can make out with it here the question is how did you start to pray together was it awkward or hard at first you have any tips we just started doing like we could start doing something when we got married what was like before that like somebody would pray I mean and then sometimes like we started doing then both people like you would go and then I would go especially if it was about something that we both feel like we really wanted to both kind of pray about you know I mean whether it's like we're moving or it's like family stuff you know like what we usually like one person will like cuddle when I met Steve in college the other person always falls asleep like they do it they're like 10 minutes and so when Steve and I met in college you know he I wasn't a believer and I wasn't safe and so for me praying was just an intimate thing I did alone at night you know the comfort of my own privacy in my own home so when I met Stevie and he obviously you know loved Jesus and he just openly would pray for people you know seeing that and how strong he was at it I always felt like oh my gosh like I'm gonna sound so weak praying for him it's almost gonna be a slap in his face like you know like because maybe the words I'm not gonna be like pressure to like be good right yeah you want to count on them they're like the perfect pastor would and then once I finally took that pressure off of myself and I just prayed in in a way that was almost like we were just having a conversation and I'm getting god into that conversation as I was you know praying that you know blessings would come upon you and whatever season of life you were in struggling with it's like when you take when you get out of your own head I think words just start to flow and it just becomes conversational and then that person genuinely cares about you you shouldn't be worried about what is he doing they love you so much and are so grateful that you're even praying for them then like you should just go into it with that thought process so what I did it helped me and now I think I'm a better pray if someone's judging you while you're praying I mean that's just so you get done really your prayer comes nobody that's what people who don't have like the experience of praying the church problem they probably yeah once you get to the inside and you realize what it's about it's like that's like the last thing yeah there's nothing I mean there's no it's like you stumbled during that dinner conversation with God right and I think like I used to try to pray like eloquently and then I realized like I'm gonna have a conversation with God like how I would have a normal conversation like not gonna use words that I don't know what analyzation - yo yo yo   what's poppin today it's more so than intention behind it that's really important and so I would say just do it just do it that's literally it I don't and I want to ask this when I see one okay it says cubby and Lexi we're off the hook thank you why doesn't tini have little John cousins already see is getting hotter there's just a right time for everyone and you know anything can happen yeah we originally thought it was gonna be like four years after we got married and then for years came late this year we're coming up on six years whoo but I don't know I just don't there's been a lot of transition in our lives I can't wait to maybe move out of our other house and when you when you have a transition like that it kind of resets your like comfort clock if you will look like where you're at yeah yeah I think we've had a few things like that in terms of career and the heirs of like housing and we're staying and we finally feel comfortable here so I don't know I think that we see obviously Lexi sees a lot of like baby content on Instagram which is like oh my gosh that has to be us like really soon a lot of those TV so I would love to you so good with her too it's not that you guys don't want children or like oh they're not for me yeah like when I see you guys around teeny like you guys just have that natural I feel like instinct of what it's gonna take to be parents like the love that you guys pour it into like her I can't imagine what that would be like for your own kid so I appreciate and respect the fact that our conversations we've had because yes kit children now are all over social media and you guys are not the type of people to just jump the gun because Society might tell you or the amount of the years you guys have been married or like well it's time because it's a very big and important decision and I know that you guys are the type where it's like when you guys become parents you're not just gonna become parents you're gonna be the best parents and you want to make it worth it you want that kid to come into a world that you guys are really comfortable and confident in so that's what is madness what are you guys and it's good that you guys aren't rushing it you know meanwhile us we're just right so in favor to try to knock it all I'm hoping I'll take one that my baby is just a cheat day they don't troll me right now I made the worst decision ever to ask Cody to keep me accountable for not eating sweets we named this it first hand he tries and I'm like they just let me have this right now and that's what you supply me to keep me what about the name Stevie for this one because Steve's like hey bro do you want an ice-cream sandwich TV broke yeah you broke theirs I sold that sandwich hard do it ice all right I tell her in the moment hey you said only the weekends and this was what a Tuesday it was it was a Tuesday Saturday Saturday with you yeah the one that's like let's go to the gym then I want on top of the gym and I'm more on top of desserts who's like balance you could change one thing about your wedding what would it be so one thing I would change about our wedding it's a no-brainer I would want my family my parents there because they weren't the first time and I know that now they would be so that's what I would change what would you change by our wedding I probably would have kind of enjoyed and tried to reminisce in the moment because I feel like your wedding day happens so fast for you whether you try to chill and try to take it in and I feel like when you see all your family members it's such a blip because you don't have time to spend to take a moment and be like hey how's it going like house why not I feel like it's always congrats to you you're awesome let's get a photo with the family yeah so I would have tried if I could have like got into my 24 year old brain and said hey really try to enjoy the day because this is the one special day that you'll always remember and you'll have pictures and video from it but the experience it's like that's why I told show me my little sister I was like her and her now-husband mate I was like hey just try your best to enjoy this today this day because it just happens knowing that now would you have a small wedding no I think I liked like the size holiday but I think it would have made it less than maybe easier a little bit easier and less hectic when there's less people to entertain it was a 525 people know there was like a hundred seventy people at all right oh really Oh Shelby had 120 yeah yeah there's a lot of people Kody has a huge family yeah what would you say I would change you know what I would sincerely change I would change my hair and makeup okay Brad because here's the same when I well what if somebody didn't like it it's that I feel like for you   well maybe back then in my database I felt if I had to be like really like glam and like I got my makeup done by makeup artist and like yeah I don't know I just I look back and I'm like especially at the time that's not how I would have done my own hair and makeup you didn't like your makeup is is watching this like killer eyes I came to my bride friends it's like look exactly like yourself on whatever makes you feel beautiful but don't do things on your wedding day that you would never normally do just for the sake of like because it's my wedding like I have eyelashes on I rarely ever wear false eyelashes my makeup my eyeshadow was like a lot darker than it like blue yes but I like I believe a mask you know it was it was just I just wish I would have looked more like Lexie yeah on the day to day it's good and so that's an advice I would give to brides like you can still you'll look so beautiful and glowy like yourself and in ten years you'll look back in your kitchen and be like that me me versus eating like oh wow that's like this bride that I was trying to be you know what I mean what I would change about both of our weddings is that meet each other we didn't know in about four years only so here Y years I'm doing is really do want to get divorced again wait what do you not really did that - like attract people to your story we got divorced and then we got married again and you get all the wedding brands doing social media on another catastrophic divorce we love you guys thank you so much for watching go watch their Channel we're putting a video up over there as well and I'm like I'm gonna wax my mustache and show you because what else is there to do today by yourself it's fine   what aren't you too excited to get up today Cody puts this on first thing every morning he just wrapped the blanket around his shoulders like he's some king all right you want some coffee yes I have all different mugs which has driven Cody crazy our whole marriage so I tried to try to get rid of them but I still have a few that I love had this one for about 10 years it's my Alice in Wonderland mom and that is the one I will be having today you know really very it's the width of the god so Lexie drinks her coffee black but she makes mine with love as I always say but then what are the ingredients to my amazing coffee one pour of half-and-half you a little cold okay daddy's gonna be Saturn who loved getting his sweater put on okay I think you're the only dog I've ever seen in my whole life who loves getting a sweater put on them cool you look so handsome I'll see how you look real quick let's see you Wow Wow very Christmassy okay okay ready for breakfast he's like where is my food it says turkey hmm look at him he will love this stuff please go sit over there for me to answer okay everybody so we're in our room right now in the front part of our house where we do our devotionals or we come and we sit and we drink some coffee and today we're making a video that's kind of a day in the life of this quarantine strange situation already so we're not quarantined here in LA where we have to stay in our houses but they're highly encouraging that we do not go out for any reason unless it's to go to the grocery store unless it's to go get some gas to go get supplies they did say we could go out and get some fresh air we could go on hikes we could go on bike rides as long as we're keeping our social distancing of course and as creators during this time I will have to say it's been a bit strange to figure out what kind of content to make to where we're brightening people's days and being positive but also acknowledging what's going on because it would just be weird if we were just making videos as if nothing was going on so we are all sharing this experience with you guys we're here at home we're practicing all the things that you need to do to not spread this thing but at the same time we're not gonna let this beat us we're not gonna let this get us down we're still gonna say it as positive as we can yeah the code is right and I think it's like you know you guys are already hearing so much about what's going on in the world mostly negative I'm sure and so our goal is to brighten your day and so we're not gonna make this video super somber or super sad or you know really talk about it anymore because you've heard so much about it but we do want to say that we see you all we're all in this together and we're thinking of you and your families we're praying for you guys every single person watching right now we're praying for you we're just following all the federal and local guidelines on what we have to do which is this for right now it might get more strict maybe not but until then we're just doing everything that we can do to brighten our own spirits around the house and trying to keep things as normal as possible we you know are concerned but we don't lack hope we have faith we have confidence in God and we do believe that brighter days are ahead and we're looking forward to them obviously this is a really unique time it's kind of weird so I feel like if you need to catch up on rest if you want to just lay and watch Netflix if you want to do absolutely nothing I think take the time and do that that's really important and really good for you and your mental health on days where I want to be more productive something that's been really helpful is actually still using my planner this is it and writing down some things I want to accomplish throughout the day I've noticed that on days where I actually write down some goals I accomplished way more than on days where I just kind of create a mental list of things that I would like to do now a lot of these things aren't activities that like have a hard date that they need to be done by a lot of them are things I've just been wanting to do for a long time so today for example I am going to go for a run in a little I think it's really important to get your body moving a couple times a week if you can it's really good for you for your mental health for your stress levels and if we're building your immune system so I have that written down I have to film this video written down we might repaint the fireplace today or we might build shutters for outside I want to make a list of charities and figure out how we can help so that I can share that on my IG story this week and hopefully by the time this video is up I will have done that so I'll put those down below as well I highly recommend each morning or the night before for the next day just writing some things down that you want to accomplish it'll just instill a bit of a sense of normalcy especially if you're not used to working from home and you won't find yourself in this situation where you feel like you know you've gone a week or weekend half without really doing anything I feel like that tends to make me feel a little bit sad and depressed I feel a lot better when I feel like I'm accomplishing things even if it's simple things like cleaning up so I highly highly recommend that if you're not doing it already oh you lace it up I just decided I'm running two minutes ago I don't want anyone to like you know recognize me when I'm running on this empty quarantine so in an odd turn of events we're gonna go for a run we've literally never gone for a run maybe like in the past eleven years yeah but not in LA but we live in a really cute like runnable area now so we're practicing social distancing we are gonna stay six feet away from everybody else that we see our friend John's also coming because as you guys know he lives right behind us so he's basically been living with us this entire time but we'll be staying six feet away from everyone and it'll just be nice to go outside get some fresh air and see how far I can run cuz I literally don't even know how far I can run as person I never run hopefully you can get to the end of the block I'm gonna are you kidding me oh he's such a good runner he's so fast and I'm not so whole distance I don't know I'm fast short distance my goal is three miles without stopping also if you want to know what this beautiful getup is I'm wearing the softest sweater I've ever put on my body it's from Lou and gray show my pants these are Airy also very soft I'm just basically all about wearing the softest clothes I can put on my body it's a really good life hack let's go all right we just ran three miles started off the day John style I'm so sorry I'm so hot I don't know the last time I ran that far for anything Wow I only stopped for traffic yeah and I stopped before I did a sprint like you guys which was no sense right yeah like my kind of a six-mile we're all laying out getting some Sun after a nice run because well there's just nothing else to do growver getting some Sun   are you tanning those thighs so really quick before I shower the boys have been doing projects around here and they're about to build shutters for the Adu window this looks really really good yeah that looks beautiful and you guys are gonna stain it amazing show us what's standing up American walnut oh yeah I love that it's perfect

because we're partnering with function of beauty on this video if you guys haven't heard me talk about them before now you will cuz I love them so basically a haircare as you know is not one size fits all a lot of people think they can just use any shampoo or conditioner but really your hair type and what you're looking for and your hair goals matters so much for your shampoo and conditioner and that's why I love this brand because it's completely customizable down to look at this my name's on it and I put stickers on it let's see yours function of Cody another thing that I always look for in my shampoo and conditioner as I wanted to be paraben free and sulfate free and vegan so this is all of those things I've already been hooked this is actually Cody's first set of shampoo and conditioner and we got really lucky with everything that's going on we ordered it online and it got shipped to our house and so if you can't get outside to get shampoo and conditioner I feel like this is such a time to actually try out function of beauty it's super simple all you have to do is go on their website and you take a quiz it literally takes like just a couple of minutes they ask you a few questions about like like what kind of hair type you have and what you're looking to do to like and make your hair healthier and it's all the way down to like the color and the scent you like yeah so Cody chose what's it you just care I think a pair oh wow so good don't eat it though and they have a new scent that I've never had before I usually get the eucalyptus then this smells like rose smell that oh my hair Rosa oh I just love that you can specify exactly what you want for your hair so for me I do anti-aging for is reduction I do lengthen I do strengthen and nourish the roots you

gotta just like you know snake eyes them one two all right we made these little custom shutters there this little one by three pieces of wood that we just kind of nailed together and we're about to stain the next ride John with what does it call the American we're gonna stain them next so look nice and finished the boys finished their work of art ready for the big reveal tah-dah it looks so good you guys wow it looks like a proper little custom mmm this actually took us I'm not kidding Cody what do you think probably from start to finish 15 minutes to build you and have them completely stained wow you did such a good job I love this stain it's like the perfect color the American walnut if anyone's looking well I love it it's a proper little house all you needs like a little bench right there you know those half circle tables Oh circle tables who cares Cody all right folks this is the homemade shutter job as you can see the shutters are just made up of three pieces of wood and the kind of cross beam that we just cut from the same exact size piece and we nailed these on with very small little nails we mounted it to the stucco with a masonry screw as you can see right there and at first I was doing it wrong I was just trying to screw it through the wood into the wall but what I had to do is I had to take a masonry bit and hook it to the end of my my wireless battery power drill and we drove the hole into the stucco first to kind of start the screw and then we just took the masonry screw and put it right through again and it worked and it's mounted and it's a very sturdy and they look really fresh against the against the new house so here is some footage of us building this yesterday well actually we painted it yesterday we built it the day before I said we but really the boys just built it the boys are now working on the benches that we've met you good working on the benches that we've been making for both the ATU in my house so doing the final couple cuts all right it's gonna be loud for a second go for it this is the bench so far this one's going in the Adu so that John can have a little breakfast nook the end it actually has storage in it which is awesome because since it's a tiny home there's not that much storage in there but it looks really good we're gonna paint these white in a little bit   I painted it but obviously we've had some extra time on our hands so I've been thinking for a while how great a built-in would be in this corner because we don't have as much seating as we would like to in this room and so it's like a double purpose thing it's the bench and then there is a ton of storage inside that I can put throws our subwoofers in there to kind of keep it hidden and it's super cozy to sit on so when we have extra guests thinking just chill in this tiny little nook and it almost looks like a belt in which I really love so um I'm excited about it see police we've been getting creative over here I like bench we have only been around the same group of people for the last two weeks I know I was just talking to John yesterday and I was like what do I even say to each other we've seen each other what you do right after you woke up every Monday laundry worked out make you keep well we don't want to spread our germs to anyone so but we've all been together since day one so and we're next-door neighbor's

more videos during this weird time I mean I don't know it's like what do you think we did the best we could to give you guys a video over day in the life we're just doing what we can to stay busy stay

worth it what do you say coats you know I'm not a dessert guy but this is good homie so we're only working with 448 square feet in this entire place what's up everybody it's been a heck of a journey but we're finally here our guesthouse is fully completed and approved by the city and today we're gonna give you guys the tour so they worked on this for about two and a half months and luckily we had a man incredible contractor who took care of everything for us and just made it really smooth but it was dirty out here there was trash everywhere we had a port-o-potty come on so we are glad that it's done and we're so happy with how it turned out it turned out absolutely incredible our goal was to make it like a little mini version of our home so you can check out our home tour if you want to see what our house looks like but I'm excited to show you guys so let's just head on in alright let's go inside okay it is cold and rainy outside which is very rare for LA so we're gonna keep that door shut just in freezing cody's kneeling down for them to be frightened I am so excited to watch every show them first I don't know there's so many little choices where we can start let's start with the kitchen I can't start at the gifting this is our kitchen guys and as you can see Lexi loves the very bright white style with the gold accents and we kind of brought that back for our tiny house kitchen and we decided to go with all the appliances I was looking online and trying to compare prices of like new stuff and it really wasn't that much different so Lexi and I so brand-new appliances in the kitchen because it's the first thing people see when they come in you just need to talk about this like you know more than me you know kitchen stuff okay so that's we're only working with four hundred and forty square feet in this entire place so we wanted to make this a stripped kitchen so we could optimize all of our space basically the entirety of the kitchen is against this one wall has a lovely bright window you know good light is everything and it actually turned out so incredible in the beginning I was a little bit worried and I was looking at the plans that it was going to feel perhaps in here but it actually it feels so spacious and we were able to incorporate so much storage in this place we have a ton of drawers we have a ton of little you know nothing crannies for everything that you may need and we actually were also able to incorporate a pantry which I thought was super important because you know I love my snack so I had to provide max tastes for anyone who is going to be living here so we'll show you in a second but we decided to vault the ceilings which makes this place feel a lot bigger than it is but we also didn't want to lose the space kind of in this central area so we actually created a huge storage enough above the refrigerator and in the closet as well in the bedroom so that people can kind of store their stuff up there maybe suitcases or any bulkier items without you even really seeing so the only thing that's not on this wall the minute you walk in the kitchen is the refrigerator and you know I think it's just the perfect spot to do up your snacks about your fridge you got your sink right over there so it's all kind of in a great position for someone who likes to cook one of the hardest decisions that we had to the kitchen was what to do with the backsplash I picked a bunch of different backslashes and we were at Home Depot for like two hours who do you wanted to kill me trying to figure out which path slash to go with we ended up landing on the hexagon tile it's just really simple and pretty it was kind of between this and subway tile which we had in our old house and I just I really thought that this gave it a little bit of an edge which I loved and then of course we did the gold accents but we decided to actually go with a matte black faucet in here and didn't want it to feel too feminine here or too masculine and want to feel neutral so I feel like the matte black kind of brings in a touch of masculinity that's really nice and it also matches the appliances you know yeah just flows really well together so I love it in here Cody and I have spent so much time in this tiny home just being like there's nothing to     do through the living room okay so guys like Alexi was saying we decided to go with the vaulted ceilings and you have soda baby it's made the difference in this place yeah it makes this place feel really really big so Lexy picked out this amazing gold light fixture right here we're still kind of deciding is it paining a little too low because I mean almost 60 tall we were standing over here and I was like okay from my perspective you're it in this high but do it from your perspective from my perspective it is back so it's like we're trying to figure out if we placed it to do it but for right now it looks amazing it matches the gold accents in the kitchen and guys you can see we have our two beams up here and these beams are actually full of wood beams that are going these actually there hold this place up are actually a little bit thinner than that so they put nice low beams over top of the ones that were already there and Lexi and I picked the state in noting Lexi she didn't want to go with the default color stain she wanted to mix these two different stains and we did what like a 2 to 3 ratio or something to come up with this particular same company this is our air unit right here this is an air and heating unit it's very very efficient this is what a lot of homes are using now believe it or not instead of central heating if you're all the smaller side of the home is small 1,200 square feet ish and below you're definitely using these the way cheaper and way more efficient and we already tested this thing both air and heat and ban the whole place within 10 15 minutes it was like the temperature so this thing is incredible um as you guys we see the high window is now installed it's just brings in a beautiful white it just adds a lot boring when you look out the weather you kind of just see the trees and although that trees kind of dinner right now but well then it leaves on it's going to be such a refreshing thing to be able to just look up and just seem like once again I love it light and bright but we didn't want it to be all too white and light in years so we decided to go with actually a little bit of a darker floor than I originally imagined and I absolutely love how it looks it just brings so much warmth and texture in here it makes it feel just so rich and beautiful so I absolutely love this floor color and I'm really happy that we went with this our other option was a floor color that was more of like a grayish tone and I feel like this really warm the place up so I'm really glad that we went with the darker floor and the darker beams as well it honestly you can tell on camera but it does feel really spacious in here our friend John is actually going to be living in here and we kind of mapped out where his furniture was going to go all the tape on the floor and it felt really really good so I'm excited it this is such a comfortable cozy space and it's definitely enough room for one to two people so all right should we go to the ethernet today yeah let's go check out the bedroom this is the bedroom because these sputnik light fixtures poking through boughs and it's beautiful in here you've got those two beams running through once again you have a huge storage area there above the closet and for someone like my friend John I don't know what he's gonna have so much stuff they cannot store so I can imagine you're putting some really cool hanging plants in there or maybe some are to the photographer so I feel like we're gonna make it look really really cool and artsy in here this is a full-size closet there's some of the stuff in here already he's starting to move in so it's a little bit open it's perfect so if you able to fit all this stuff this room is not a big room by any means but once again not set out don't you look fit a king-size bed in here I couldn't believe it hi squeeze you gonna have this much space around to walk through but I mean what are you doing your room you sleep so you don't really need that much extra extra space to hang out in here and we've got this beautiful window which is one of my favorite parts about the house cuz it just lets so much light in this room I was very concerned when we started building about putting windows in the right places to make sure that we had plenty of good light in here because I just think having a well-lit place just changes your whole mood your old vibe so it was really a big concern of mine god bless us I could not be happier with how bright this place turned out because even a little brighter than our house which is pretty amazing we can wake up in the morning look out here we're going to put a chicken two out there in the corner John and whoever lives here after we'll be able to wake up and smell the farm-fresh hens laying there so I'm just getting I was like I don't know how it goes a very important change that we made from the original plan that I'm so happy we did is we didn't eight hockey anymore which is very important because you didn't want to lose any of the space from a regular door swing and you wouldn't have any access to this space because of the door needing to open so this is the move babe I'm glad we did it and another thing that we did on purpose to make it look and feel bigger in here was of course adding the mirrors closet doors because mirrors in the stasis look bigger and brighter so yeah alright I want to show them Dib vanya album man whatever I come in here I just realized how much we killed it I can't alive because when you walk into the bathroom it is not the same exact vibe as the kitchen and the rest of the house like we've now kind of gotten into a more gray stainless look like when it comes to the accents we went with a sort of grayish almost like light blue colored vanity we went with like this wooden mirror and I gotta say I bought this really cheap light fixture from Home Depot it was 16 bucks and we had it installed and Lexi loved everything about this bathroom but the light just bugging the heck out of her so she's like we gotta change that light I'm like oh we don't have to change it this thing was expensive and now we got to buy a whole nother light but I got to say this light really matches the whole vibe of the rest of this house it's got kind of these Edison bulbs inside let me turn this on so anyways here's the light we put Edison bulbs in there we have this window installed here and it's tempered glass so you can't see out but it still brings the light in it's a bathroom so you wouldn't want to see it anyways hey we got a nice thrown in here man I mean it does the job what's the brand it's an American Standard America so it's a toilet that works is all it matters and mend this shower we went with you know like Cody said the brushed nickel and it's just you know it's a great sized shower for such a small place you even bought your little shampoo and conditioner and standing here which I love and once again we brought the hexagon tile back through so that's kind of a running theme in the house I absolutely love this one because it's stone and it's beautiful same thing with the floors in here it kind of all echoes what's going on in the kitchen except we decided to go with the brushed nickel as Cody said because we have a stackable washer and dryer in here now this was a difficult decision because obviously this takes up a lot of visual space but we figured hey if we were the ones living in this house we would want a washer and dryer in here so we just have to do it we're gonna eventually build a little wall right there to kind of make a separation so that you can just come in see the vanity maybe put a couple cute pictures on that little wall and then of course you have your full washer and dryer so you can not be thankee exactly and I think it's really worthwhile for someone to have like an industry size washer and dryer because they're really much better than the alternative which Lexi and I had bought this smaller unit that was a washer and dryer and one and unfortunately the thing that just didn't work really well so that this is the one thing about the house that we kind of had to sacrifice what we have wished you know it's kind of bigger it sticks out a little bit from the vanity and this video guys honestly wouldn't be real if everything turned out perfect all the time so this was the one thing that we realized look practicality has to win over looks sometimes especially in the bathroom when when you see it you're not even really seeing the unit's like when you're just having the door opening you're using the bathroom but what's cool is it's kind of hidden by the door and over here is another yeah it is it's hidden by the door so anywhere in the path even when you walk into the bathroom like this it's just not a main focal point at all it just kind of feels like the bathroom ends here and then you know it's still there and it's still accessible we pulled a couple of our friends who are you know currently living in apartments and they said having a washer and dryer no matter where it is is the real deal it's what they want it's everything we tried to keep the matte black going in here with the door knobs and then we originally had a matte black circular mirror in here but I just really liked this mirror that I got at Target I'll try to find some of this stuff and link it down below for you guys we really did a good job of trying to find inexpensive but beautiful things to put in this house so we can read that lighting in here I'll turn that light on so the light in here in the evening is absolutely amazing because we have these LED lights which provides so much light and the apartment I've ever lived in you have to have like a lamp and another little table light fixture because not many places have really good recessed lighting so it was definitely priority of ours to get good lighting in the ceiling here because I just I need light let there be light okay so we got a shout out here is our amazing contractor who basically brought our dream to life and we kind of love the heck out of them whatever we wanted to add something new can we add an outlet can we add some closet storage what else do we I mean we change quite only example yeah who changed quite a few things we actually changed the layout the door was originally supposed to be over there and then the kitchen was gonna be here and you're gonna have to like walk through the kitchen I was like nah so we changed quite a bit but I think the little details in a home are really what makes the biggest difference like for example we put an outlet here up on the wall so that if someone wanted to put their TV up they wouldn't have a bunch of cords hanging down to the floor a lot of people when we were doing the tiny home because it is somewhat of an investment property for us we're like just do the cheapest thing make it livable and I think there is a way and I think we accomplished it to make something not necessarily so expensive or go so overboard on it but also make it look really beautiful and I think these extra little accents you know the handles those handles are from Amazon they were not expensive at all I think it was like $20 for a 12-pack or something like that so there definitely are ways to do home improvements and make your home look absolutely beautiful without breaking the bank and we did that in here so high-five babe I love this is just this has been a dream come true for us it's been such a fun process it's been so cool to see how we were able to like think this place up and pick all the little tiny details that go into it and just come together to like build something new so it's been a lot of work yeah and it got really real at the very end because the end was the time where Lexie and I had to come together and pick all the accents choose the appliances you were going to all these stores and looking at like broken down used appliances from all these different shops trying to figure out the best way to budget because once again we didn't want to necessarily spend money that we need that we didn't need to spend so the washer and dryer actually set in hand we bought them used and then the rest of the appliances we were able to get on super sale and get them use so we're just happy we're like powers this has been such a huge dream in bolivars for a really long time we're so excited that people that we love are going to be able to live in here and be blessed by it and enjoy it it's a space that I personally would love to live in if I were downsizing you're living in a tinier spot Cody and I have lived in some really small places and I'm like wow we could have lived in a place like this yes those times that would have been a dream come true so it's it's really great and I hope that you guys love it and I hope that you enjoyed following along on this process with us you know we always love bringing you along and I just feel like I really want to go out into the world and flip houses now and make old crusty houses feel new and beautiful and like give them new life so maybe one day we'll have the capacity to be able to do that would be so flippin fun no pun to thank you guys so much for following along on this journey with us it's been so much fun let us know if you want us to see if our friend will bring you back in here when it's all furnished you look kind of what it looks like once you have furniture in here because I'm sure that he's gonna do a great job of transforming the space even further and making it feel cozy I'm also curious if it's gonna feel a little cramped I don't think it will but what's the weight so guys if you liked the video give it a thumbs up you know Lexie and I we're always thinking of our next project and we'll always share that with you guys so subscribe

when you look at the credits you're gonna show today Lexie and I are gonna read some of our text messages to each other to you guys we've done this before and it's literally insane to look back and see the things that would be saying to each other over text let's just get into it and see why we're still cray we're gonna show you the good the bad and the ugly don't judge us Lexi's texts to me just call the police god forbid he has a gun not worth risking your life exclamation point exclamation point you never know call the cops and I say I'm not going up she goes okay okay first of all why do you think when you're reading as me what is it call the police is that what family I know the type of concern you probably had in your voice all right so me Marcus Kristin and LexA we're all just hanging out at our house and I think that they got a notification on their ring that there was some movement front of their door no there was a guy well there was a good guy standing out their front door the boys were like we're just gonna go over there they were at our house and then they were driving over there so I was like wait don't like go try to interact with this person just call the police if there's a person who's on your property I was getting nervous on like them I said getting gas because I love you you said I can get it mommy I said okay I like getting gas because I probably would have make it home if I didn't love you though and then you said so are you getting gas and I said this picture so I always have to get the gas because she just thought she blames it on like being paranoid of getting gas and somebody creeping on her which okay I understand but I just don't like anyone getting gas she's a little bit lazy in that way so I always get the gas in our car so you know that the car needed gas so bad that Lexi would stop and get gas because you probably think he made it usually I'm running on fumes I'm like I actually might not make it home so I should probably go get gas I have run out of gas before I was like in high school that happened so I say it text me if you want something from Jamba mmm-hmm and you go and you never need an answer so you said sorry I was steaming my dumplings with this face what is it wait were you not standing don't blame to read on the toilet no I was in the steam room at the gym naked oh I thought you were cooking I thought you didn't answer because you were actually steaming dumplings like to eat so you were you were in the sauna steaming I said at Whole Foods people are legit prepping for Corona the lines are over 30 minutes long the employees said it's never like this people are stocking up so she's over here painting a picture like it's the apology because it kind of was and then you proceeded to text me gas can shorten adjust location of vanity lights move vanity mirror so time door texture things that we need to like do like a to-do list but it's it's not because I want her to do it or whatever it's just so I can remember I'll text like a list to her so that I can go back and look at it in my phone if that makes microwaves died shelves interior closet wrap giving me a stressful voice claiming that I stead it like this you are so like this on point about everything you're just like interior closet shelf rack voice sometimes I'll just send Kody pictures me you know to just be like hey David I'm gonna fit in this picture and I said do you like me I know she'll drop me a selfie thank you something like cute and did I hey what did I say cut off my response some of these texts just aren't gonna make sense they're just they're just banter like married back-and-forth banter so Lexi says want me to bring you to go food Mediterranean and I just send her you're looking a Balochi think of me like somebody yes or the restaurant say yeah what can I bring that's why I added us I wanted to show them how great you are as a wife you know you guys know I'm not officially a foot model but I have been said to have some of the nicest feet on the Internet don't open the wormhole just get to the text this is basically just a running joke my feet are actually not you at all this guy competent on the Instagram like a weird creep and he just commented heart the little face with the hearts around it and feet this is good to see my feet in that photo and I texted it to Cody and said so many people feed into love on my toes just remember that next time you make fun of my feet I don't be funny yes you do your big beautiful feet my big beautiful feet and my foot has a hump on the top it's perfectly normal I had a foot doctor look at it okay yeah and Kobes always like I love that beautiful hump on your foot yeah that's cool looks like you don't really see it on humans all right so I'm not gonna get into this too much but unless Lexi and I were at this event and there was a performance happening and I see this text me this like in the event while it's going on I haven't had enough wine for this total spit it up she goes I haven't had enough wine for this and then a few stuff you seconds later hello she goes I am dying I had to leave because I almost burst out laughing five times and then she goes Marcus will ride with you like hey she is leaving and Marcus was there so I was gonna ride with him so anyways Lex it's very very blunt when she's not being entertaining something and it's not I don't like it like we're out and something's going on we're watching a show or something and I'm just like we need to go you'll do this sometimes and you're being completely serious but it's so freaking funny what is it you'll take pictures of yourself with something like in a very serious manner so you send me this message this is a perfect example okay a method is no he sends me hey I have a question how do you feel about this this is the picture he puts in there because I had I had the lady take a photo with me pointing to the things you know you're not you're like their crust in your leave you honey and yes a random woman make this for you and I wanted to make sure I got the right one I'd get your approval on everything you guys you know that that's funny that means something else I was serious yeah great yeah we can tell you wasn't so this was pretty scary actually so I said scariest thing just happened everything's fine but the bad dog from the neighbor bursts out and ran at gate a German Shepherd neighbors started yelling and I grabbed heat and picked him up from the ground and Lex he goes no it was the killer oh my god no no no I said the owner said the dog starts fights and then she goes are you okay and I say and it got out and I was so scared I just expected to get attacked but I held geet high in the air I'm a little scared put ok now but that's definitely the bad dog and it's real yeah so I'll just break down the story quickly yes so dramatic yeah that was a little extra when we first moved into the neighborhood one of my neighbors told me because he saw that we had Grover who's like a smaller dog and he said hey there's actually a dog in his neighborhood watch out because he's attacked and actually killed some dogs who got $2 so I was a little bit like I was a little afraid and I was like well that's not cool like a neighborhood were moving into I don't I want to be able to walk over and not have any issues and so he so he explained that the dog stays inside but he had he's gotten out before and killed dogs and I was like that is insane so the thing that annoyed me was I messaged the realtor who was selling this house that we bought and I and we kind of asked hey there's dog situation whatever and the real estate person just brushed it off and said no never heard that the true yeah so I'm on a walk with Grover like around the corner just giving him a walk in the neighborhood and I just hear yelling from neighbors like no no no and I had I had headphones on I was in the music walking Grover but I still heard because it was so loud I turned around and I just see this German Shepherd huge German Shepherd growling and running at me I legitimately thought that I was going to be just fully like jumped on and like just ripped just written which Germans are usually great they are but they're also police Don yeah it depends I'm a trained them yeah this dog in particular this German Shepherd was was running towards me I was scared and then and literally I had one second to put all the puzzle pieces together like nothing this could be the dog that's like doing this so I pick up Grover and literally hold him in the air like Simba and so I was I was freaked out but anyways that's the story so I basically I was freaked out and honestly I was here for over but I was I was shaken for myself because I thought I was about to be attacked by that dog so I was like uh I texted like say like oh the dog the dog gonna hurt you it just likes to hurt dogs no the dog just if it's circled me it never touched me and it was just barking and Grover as I held him in the sky honestly Grover's a flippin nugget he was almost 30 pounds I felt like a 200 that you can just pick up well yelling that would have been me out of luck yep the like scooped him up okay yeah he sends me a selfie of himself with the appliances in the trunk which was cute but I said thank you big thank you baby I said BV to him and autocorrect corrected it - no they Lexi's - biggest pet peeves in this order are number one when I don't put the trash bag back in the trashcan when I take it out and put it in the outside bin she hates what I do that the second pet peeve is when I was selling something on Craigslist for like a visitor okay let me interject really quick these people should not be coming to our house period okay well you know and meet them somewhere but this pakodi does he goes to sell something I think he's just mysteriously never home when that charts amazing the guys coming to pick up the old chair if you could take the money and give him the chair and I'm like no change so I text Lexi and I know I'm screwed like she could be ticked I say this lady sent her boyfriend for the Lance and he's early if so I told her he'll have to wait and Lexi just goes he's here I literally can see Lexi's days I get these texts she goes he's here I'm still naked and I said yeah just don't worry it'll have to wait she said 1:30 and it looks he goes okay wait also I thought it would be okay that I wasn't there because it was a lady who was gonna come and make the exchange so I'm okay with Lexi making the deal with another lady but if it's a dude she's sending her her boyfriend who's a dude gonna come over and I don't want her to like do the exchange I'm a Latina okay I don't trust no random coming over my house when I'm home to come do some kind of exchange so this is when we were in Florida Cody was and guys day and I texted him and I said miss you you having fun he said hey beautiful yes we're here about to eat dinner at Hard Rock up a hundred bucks of blackjack playing for free the rest of the night smiley face and I said win me money Lexie loves me but I'm in money I do no wrong but if I'm losing if I'm down twenty bushes at hey maybe don't double down she wants to get it make sure I'm like being super careful of what damage to let me give a disclaimer if we ever are gambling we gamble not a lot of money at all so it's kind of fun because we like are so excited if we went $20 oh yeah this particular night we actually came and surprised you guys you're a pig screaming out I was cruising and I am your lucky charm you've got admit it because when I got there you what you ended up winning like $350 that night yeah what she's sitting there and you know you know giving me the back rub I'm getting hands close to 20 in here back rub we hope you guys like this video of seeing some of our text going back and forth between Lexi and I if you liked this video give it a thumbs up and we hope you guys stay safe stay healthy out there we love you guys and we'll see you guys next time you ready okay so we're not doing any cuts on this video no no cuts allowed okay all right that's already started oh my gosh hi guys um welcome back to our channel this is kind of inspired by an IG TV video I just posted on my Instagram where I filmed and didn't do any cuts and so we're like why don't we just do a YouTube video and not do any cuffs but now I feel I said cups instead of cut curtsy and now we would edit that out so you would think that Lexi never messed up like under pressure and I feel like I need to talk a million miles per hour okay tell him what we're talking about today okay so I'm not allowed to edit this video but can I do GE little zooms sure as long as there's no no cutting out of anything all right so we just wanted to do a video today and just kind of reflect on the experience that we've gone through during this whole just situation in this whole lockdown that we've all all of us you both you and us have gone through and I kind of want to start by talking about the toilet paper because as you guys know across the country oh the glow all of all across all across the globe toilet paper was sold out everywhere it's crazy what oh well no that's well the paper pandemic started happening before the actual pandemic was it's only and I noticed that was the first time because I went to our local Trader Joe's which I feel like most people don't buy toilet paper from Trader Joe's and this woman came in and she was like I had to come here for delivery and this is not the first or no the third of the store the third store that she'd gone to to get toilet paper and I was just like we is this getting bad like is this real yeah luckily we were saved from have with the lack of toilet paper because of an accident is basically a happy accident because you know as some of you may know you know with with these with Amazon and things where you can kind of order in advance Lexi had which I thought was a brilliant idea started ordering things on auto-ship that we wouldn't have to go and buy from the store all the time like toilet paper it's like a lot to carry and paper towels and that stuff is it's just kind of bulky so and you always need it man you always need it so Alexi was so smart to kind of start auto shipping those to our house well the first two like we let slide it's like okay we got an extra toilet paper but she kept letting it slide and then all of a sudden well it's fine I think it's live you mean I ordered too much dozens and dozens more than we actually do I don't know what we just kidding I was really bad about canceling it so then we had like a stockpile hoarder collection of toilet paper and paper towels and then before you keep in mind I just want to let him know that we had so much toilet paper that we we haven't put new toilet papers six month belief any worries Oh before that yeah that's how much we've had but anyways continuing we removed toilet paper from our old house to this house in boxes it was problem but it's not it was you know what it was the Baron in disguise changing my lyrics okay so what else what have you learned during this pandemic well I learned that I feel like we adjusted to a sense of normalcy because I think that you and I have work from home so I feel like it's been weird to not be able to go out and see friends and those people that that was kind of it just made us feel I think more lonely and more isolated but we had each other which was obviously really nice and we each had our down days we've each had days where we were just kind of like you know this this this lockdown was kind of just like hurting us hurting our soul you know but I feel like we really learned to cope and I think that due to us working from home it was an easier adjustment than what most have had to deal with 100% and I think that it our paths are actually gave a really good analogy and he said everyone's going through the same storm but not everybody's in the same boat some people are going through this in a rowboat and some people are going through this in a yacht and that really really hit me because I have to say we are in the best case scenario for going through this you've already adjusted to working from home we don't have anyone else to be responsible for other than ourselves so we're not having to adjust to really homeschooling or taking care of kids who I'm sure extremely restless having to be at almost all China and thank God we have been healthy so we really we really have been okay but I have learned a few things even being super grateful I feel like this has caused me to be even more grateful for the small things in life and especially in the beginning when everything was going on and people were going crazy in the grocery stores and stuff like that I was just like man we're so lucky to have access to food and water whenever we want it usually and at that point we weren't sure if we were going to be able to go out to get groceries or what really was going to happen and it really made me realize so many people across the globe don't have access to clean water and they don't have access to groceries whenever they want him yeah and just the essentials in life and so I think that was really eye-opening I think also I was really wasteful before this like I was like five paper towels to clean something up or to wasteful with food we would have leftovers and instead of eating them we were just kind of like let them go bad and throw them away not on purpose but just I guess when you live in surplus you become more wasteful I don't know I mean my background growing up wasn't like a privileged background or anything it wasn't really raised that way I still shake this soap bottle of shampoo with some water and it reported there I don't put all the twos toothpaste ooh like we still have definitely like those very like scarcity mentality issues in a lot of ways but in other ways we don't and I think that this has been eye-opening and I just want to be a better steward of everything that I have and I don't want to waste as much and I'm glad that I'm even more hyper aware and sensitive to how lucky we are to be healthy and just have access to all of all the things that we need so absolutely and I know that they kind of saw that vlog where we kind of showed our day and yeah how we moved like on a normal day but what were some of the things that we kind of passed our time with doing like for example me I have done so much I feel alright in this situation yeah and I kind of an opposite of it you could talk a little bit about how you well in the beginning I think I shared the same mentality as everybody I was actually I was I was scared like especially when I saw that things were kind of escalating and getting a little bit worse I I was feeling some stress in my heart but after a while I just couldn't watch things that were gonna trigger me feeling upset or stressed so exactly I had to channel that I had that too like working outside and as Lexie knows I would just go outside and even though I was working you know how it's like when stuff feels like it's work but it's therapeutic like I was out there and I was just listening to music I was getting inspired and I was listening to like full albums which when was the last time you've listened to we listened to probably three full three or four like full albums but now that we have the record player we do listen to more albums but I feel like I got to really do that in listen to albums and I didn't work on so much music in the beginning I kind of just worked outside and I really loved just like getting my hands dirty outside but what else and stuff yeah I know the bench yeah we're working on building it a chicken coop right now we're filming a video on that for you guys and yeah you've done a really good job you've been very productive in all of this I on the other hand my thing I been doing things and I feel like um I mean I've been productive I haven't been unproductive and I've been really trying to not be hiring myself and I really want to tell you guys if you haven't been productive don't be hard on yourself but at the same time I'm always harvest oh so I'm like fruiting to the choir here but I realized you know a lot of you guys know I'm an actress and that's what I love to do and so right now the entire industry is completely shut down I don't know end in sight so at the beginning I had a couple of self tapes and some things to do I actually joined an online acting class and did that for four weeks and then nothing was happening and I was trying and nothing has been stolen I've been trying to work on my craft and improve you know being becoming better as an actor on my own but at the same time I realized I am so much better under pressure under the pressure of having a deadline having a date having something that I have to do you know what I mean today's coming yeah you have an audition on Thursday and then I'll prep for it but if I'm just like oh you should like read some of your acting book today like that's a suggestion you know and so I found myself kind of wasting a lot of time and I still have been but that's okay I think people don't struggle with that too you know really good at self-discipline I'm better at deadlines and like having deadlines and I'm a procrastinator truly and you know this like I will do it but I'll do it in the last minute and I will do a dang good job at it but it's because I'm great under pressure I'm glad she didn't curse I'll be doing live I'm just kidding so yeah so I've been trying to figure that out and um you've been doing great it's okay but also I've had to cook every single meal for the past that takes a lot of time and so I've just been different but it's okay I think that it's given us some time to reflect as well on what's important to us and what we really want to prioritize moving forward and I think that the fact of the matter is if you miss the work that you're usually able to do that probably is a testament to how much you love it and that you're doing the right thing so exactly so anyways guys we just kind of wanted to share like and we're not out of the woods yet yeah we've met lies that this is still happening and we still have you know weeks potentially months as this kind of unfolds but we kind of just wanted to connect and kind of share our experience of how we dealt with this and of course mixed with a video where there was no cuts because yeah we haven't done that we don't worry about it I don't know if you guys will like this but I hope that you do yeah it's just us rambling Cody usually cuts out about 70% of the things what do you think new that you've kind of discovered that you enjoy doing during this time I mean I think that like I started kind of getting into a lot of like Business Studies kind of gotten or just like interested in that world and I feel like I always kind of had like an entrepreneurial spirit but during this time I think that we've all had a chance to experience the world on pause and for just a brief moment in time we haven't felt like there was a race against somebody else yeah so I think a lot of people got to sort of explore new lanes so that's kind of like something I was I was kind of exploring and one other important thing was and Lexi makes fun of me for this but like this book took me four months to listen it was like written by a psychologist doctor and it was like really deep but you could only write one page I read like one page and I had like my minds like I only got up to algebra two okay in high school but I think that this book really helped me let go just a lot of just like insecurities and not just that but it was about just realizing what's important in life and realizing all the things we worry about so much and how it's just not it's just not that big of a deal and I feel like I finished it at like the perfect time because I was able to kind of let all this worry of things that I don't have control of what and I'm the type of guy who likes to have control you know I like to like produce my own outcomes but during this whole situation none of us had a grip on the outcome so I really felt like the book helped me just learn to let let go and like kind of let God you know might like to have this whole I someone once said to me control the controllables right and if it's not controllable by you stop trying to control it it just produces worry and anxiety though I certainly piano again yeah good but I'm still doing it right here every night is like okay baby I'm gonna do a concert for you and when I start playing and I hit the wrong key and I'm like yeah she starts again today again and I'm like that wasn't the real concert this is the real concert and then I got like halfway through and I mess up and I'm like yeah that was it 300 comments er yeah Lexi was saying on a walk-in - like hey like I want to be able to like just learn and play music and like sing a song and like I'm not that's not necessarily like my main thing but I can still do it and try and be good at something is a try and I was like yes you can why not and that's a great message for people it's like just because you want to try something new doesn't mean the expectation is you've got to be this it's like no anyone can learn skill you don't have to and do it I think that the assumption is you have to do things to be great at them and I've always been that way I've always been like if I'm gonna be something I have to be the best at it and really it's like no you can do things for fun things for fun and so we've been doing that I've written some more poetry which I really like I've one thing I haven't done and I've been telling Cody we should make a video about this as well is I have not cleaned my office in fact though it's an explosion in there and every everyone's like oh my house still organized nothing left to organize blah blah I don't know what is wrong with me but all I've been doing is using something wearing it whatever I'll open the door of my office like a crack and then I'll just throw things in there and then just shut the door really fast someone has to even I can't even open the door to this side so there's something guys something about me in a situation where I don't have to like it I'm learning a lot about myself and what motivates me I guess but I am gonna my excuse has been well I'm not going to clean it because we should clean it for a video that's fun so that's the laser just like the excuse like the like why I haven't done it anyway we should probably in this yeah it's probably getting along but let us know guys what you thought of this unedited uncut video checked and if you're finding us for the first time guys you should subscribe yeah subscribe to my channel follow us on Instagram we post things online yeah if you like if you like public so Cody you're like turtle all right we're gonna go for real all right guys we love you all we love you stay well stay safe oh boy I liked it ha well you got to end it what's up everybody thanks so much for coming back to the channel this week we know we haven't been on our game recently and we kind of wanted to make a video today and tell you guys what's been going on in the life of Cody and Lexie because we know so many of you guys care about us and follow us and we just want to make a video and kind of update you on what's been going on in life because it's been quite hectic lately wouldn't you say this year has been insane and it's like every time I think it's gonna get better it just levels up with something new in a bad way without really going into too much detail there's been so much going on in our lives I mean in a lot of your lives as well obviously we're all living in a global pandemic right now and everybody watching can relate because it's a worldwide thing and that was already so difficult I mean we've been self quarantined we've been home for months and then Cody's brother and his wife so my brother and sister-in-law were in a horrible accident which some of you guys may know about this already if you follow us on Instagram we haven't talked about it here on YouTube yet they have their own channels and we kind of want to you know give them the mic and let them tell their story so we'll give you guys some information that's kind of already out there but once again we want to let mark and Chris kind of tell the story on their channel but me and Lexie just got a call one night at like 9:30 that my brother and his wife were hit by a car while they're riding their bike so me and Lexie you know we just assumed the worst like we assumed the absolute worst and still that call was is still traumatizing to me it's just getting that call and not knowing first of all if they're gonna be okay are they gonna be paralyzed because they both broke their legs and so they've been recovering which is good but this definitely was a hit on our family it really put everything on pause and we needed to just take time to be there for them here for them these past few weeks obviously when something like that happens it just puts everything in life into perspective I feel like we kind of talked about it in the last video that we did so much has been put into perspective during this time the things that you thought were a big deal quickly right become less of a big deal when something like this happens and then the things that are small or that you don't even think about like walking or running or being able to pick up the phone and call your family become a really big deal and you're just so grateful so it's really flipped our perspective um and I think that's a good thing and you know this year as bad as it's been in a lot of ways it's been really good in a lot of ways in the sense where I feel like it caused us to refocus on what's most important and what's to be valued and what's to be treasured in life and so for that I'm really grateful obviously having to go through really difficult experiences is not fun in the moment whatsoever but if you can take those difficult experiences and use them for good or for a positive change I think at least they're worth something you know right our pastor always says don't waste your hurt and I think that's really powerful because a lot of the ways we connect as human beings is actually not through the highest points in our life but the lowest points in our lives and a lot of us are going through some really low points this year so I think that it'll be for good and we have to stay positive and I really do think that either an alien invasion is gonna happen next or I got word this year's gonna be really good and if the aliens do touch down I will say take me to your leader no we're going to heaven but would you be surprised though if you just saw like speech actually that's the whole joke right like there's so much that has been going on that if I saw a UFO outside that window right now I wouldn't be shocked like it would have been one year ago I'd probably be like alright then I think that we've seen such a trend of things getting worse that I think that people just need to change our perspective as a whole and start looking for the things that are good like sometimes I feel like I'm crazy when I tell you like hey you know what I still think 2020 is gonna be a good year and I appreciate your positivity for that and I you know what I agree I think it's gonna be a good year as well I think that this is the year that stirred up a lot of important issues here in the United States we are dealing with a lot of issues having to do with racial injustice and so a lot of people including ourselves have been using their voices to speak out against that and I think that you know maybe the lead-up is what it took to get to this point to where we're having these important conversations so like I said before although it's difficult I think it's for the good and I'm hopeful of that and as morbid as it sounds I even me and Lexi other day we're talking about like we couldn't believe that this accident could have happened to mark and Chris but we were still trying to think of like what what good could have come out of this is it sharing their testimony in the future is it to show people that you know people that they watch all the time can go through a very hard season and come out and still have faith like what the pandemic like why why would we go through this is it so it stirred people up and that we can all March for a good cause like that's why we've been trying to really see all these bad things and and really try to even if we don't have the answer yet to what they could be for or what good they can bring just having the attitude that it's going to bring good it's all wild yeah it is wild so if you don't follow me on Instagram I actually wrote up this post and I was crying morning that I wrote this a really hard day because I don't know if you guys know but my career as an actress has been completely put on hold this entire year nothing's happening right now and I know a lot of other people have lost their jobs and their job opportunities as well and going into this year I was like this is gonna be the best year ever it's gonna be my year you know just so hopeful and anticipating so much growth and I wrote this and it's just really interesting how my insight has changed and I'll just read it to you I said a few times I've actually chuckled thinking about how just a few months ago I said 2020 was going to be my year I had so many plans and literally nothing has gone as planned in fact mostly the opposite I know many of you can relate this morning I thought maybe it is still my year just not in the same ways I had expected maybe it's my year to realize what's most important my year to find deeper appreciation for small things like watching the sunset with the windows down my ear to accept what I can't control to learn to love myself a little bit more deeply despite not being able to do what makes me feel valuable maybe it's my year to surrender my year Wow surrendering right just giving it up to God and knowing that he's in control and instead of being anxious when we don't have control being able to rest in the fact that we're better off not having control because the one who's in control sees the bigger picture that we don't see we just wanted to make this video for two reasons one we wanted to update you we haven't posted a little a while we've got we have a lot of stuff going on obviously but two we want to share what's going on so that you guys can see that we're all going through this together we're all seeing what's going on in the world we're all feeling the weight and we feel that it's our duty to let you know that you know we may not have the answer of why or when or if things are gonna be the same or if we're going to turn around and be better than ever but I think that our attitudes can really play a large role on just how we perceive the future and how we take the next steps and how we approach this I think that if we're all positive and I think that if we can still believe that 2020 can be our year like Lexi did maybe it's not maybe it's not your year in terms of financials or a career but maybe you have a huge growth in your confidence maybe you maybe you can have a few tragedies and that you've been able to get stronger because of that so I think it's time for us to start looking at the things that are maybe not written out exactly for you and start thinking of hmm you know how can instead of my life has been in shambles because of the pandemic and because of everything going on maybe we should say okay I've gone through this in my life I'm better and stronger and for us I feel like if we can make it through this there's really not much we can't make it through this could arguably be one of the most difficult times in your life a lot of people have lost loved ones we almost lost loved ones so it's been very very heavy I think it's really important to know like being positive and staying positive doesn't mean that you wear fake smile and pretend everything's okay sometimes things are not gonna be okay being positive means that even in the difficult seasons you are able to see the light at the end of the tunnel and that's so so important it's not just putting off and not addressing the hard times because we are going through hard times but it's being able to see and recognize that brighter days are ahead and that is what positivity is all about anyway we just wanted to share a little bit of what's been on our heart recently we love and we care about you guys so much and we know we say it all the time but it is true and we feel like it's so important for us to share hope with you guys and we truly are hopeful so thank you so much for watching really quick before we go I wanted to share I share some of my poetry on Instagram and I recently shared a poem that I'm now selling in support of racial justice so I'm gonna link it down below I'm not going to talk your ear off about it right now I'm going to put the information down the description if you'd like to support a hundred percent of the profit is going to be going to that cause so I would really appreciate it I have raised three thousand dollars so far which I'm really excited about and it's all thanks to you guys those of you follow me on Instagram and have already donated or purchased a copy I sincerely appreciate it so thank you so much we love you guys and we'll see you guys on the next one very soon see you guys soon bye you hello girl what's going on guys welcome back to the channel Lexie and I have a very special video for you guys today and as you know we've been very cooped up in the house so we've been doing a lot of cool projects which we're gonna share with you a tour of our brand new okay but before we get to that I just want to say I'm so excited because today this video is sponsored by Olay which is one of my lifelong most favorite brands I've been using Olay products for a really long time at this point because it's just they're affordable they're accessible and their stuffs really really good I was lucky enough to get to test out one of their newest products early it's this new Olay Regenerist with moisturizer with SPF 40 so it's a moisturizer and sunscreen combo this stuff has upped my skincare game and taking it to the next level skincare is so important in your overall self-care so don't get your SPF what I love about this is it's so atypical to your regular you know SPF usually they kind of leave your skin feeling a little bit greasy they leave this weird texture and so I just wanted to show you today I'm wearing it underneath my makeup and seriously it works so flippin nice as a primer which is pretty shocking and it also blends into your skin so good I've been using this for like four weeks now every single day I really wanted to test it out so I'm going to show you on Cody how easily this blends in really quick come get yours I don't want to look too close so much okay your skin is perfect just look at this stuff it's cold no it wasn't so well though it feels refreshing though should I get your beard that's the one thing about having a beard for a guy it's hard to moisturize but you have to moisturize under the beard cuz you got skin under there does your skin feel greasy no does your skin feel moisturized very does it feel heavy not at all it's weightless Manor that's why they call me I cool with it on your face it's it's like just the wait list yester you don't want the freaking grease spill things with your makeup slipping off like you want your make like excuse me makeup should not look this good with SPF under it right all right so if you're in the market for an incredible moisturizer or SPF just get two in one it's so much easier and this protects against UVA and UVB rays which is super important so I'm gonna put it in the description below if you want to check out the Olay Regenerist with SPF 40 moisturizer combo wow you're feeling yourself now why do you say that you see my hair so long that it's just whipping all over the place alright enough of this we got our sunscreen on let's give them a tour of our new coupe do you want to go see the chickens or not well let's go see the chickens okay everybody we're out here in the backyard the chicken coop is right behind Lexi's head right there but before we show it to you we're gonna put some footage in there of us building it and designing it from the ground up and then we'll give you the big reveal at the end so this is the little corner of our home that we're gonna be using in our backyard for the food we have beautiful lemon trees and we kind of want to leave them because it's just nice and provides shade and bugs for the chickens yeah basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna build around this tree and then we're gonna bring it out kind of a little bit farther this way so that they have some room in the run and it's gonna be completely custom so chicken coops are expensive there was like hundreds of dollars right and by we I mean and I didn't help at all but I think it's need be really beautiful and I cannot wait to chickens again and fresh eggs we had this lovely lemon tree and we don't want to have to cut it but obviously it goes low so when we build the coop we want to be able to use as much space as possible so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make an angled roof over on this side like that and in here slightly well remember I explained the ecosystem like they bring rats but the wild cats around they eat the rats and the bugs that the lemon tree brings the chickens eat those bugs okay everybody so today we're actually starting on the coop don't let him distract peace in between these two boards that already-existing on our fence what is this called hog wire I mean it's called whatever you want to call chicken wire hog wire I mean the fancy thing to call it is hardware cloth you're using Poppy's old old cutters that are now third-generation passed down not cool so poppy is my grandfather and my late grandfather who was a carpenter by trade so he passed down a lot of these tools to me simian Lexi still get to use them to this day all right here's the frame everybody the floor plan has been sent it's gonna be a little bit skinny over here this is gonna be where the nesting area is what's cool about this setup is we really saved ourselves a lot of building because two walls are already done for us essentially we have our back fence we have our side wall that we do not have to essentially build it's already enclosed so all we had to do was build the front and a little side wall right here this is what's gonna supply our chickens with automatic water kind of like we had at our old place so the pipe goes underground it follows over here and it pops up right here so eventually we'll be able to connect right here run it behind this tree will hide the little toilet valve kind of right behind this tree so you don't see it from in the yard and the water will supply here and bring over to the chickens and that's our little watering system cool now we are just actually using some wire to thread the pieces together on the floor so I'll show you what Cody's doing he is and his croc glory 13 the chicken wire together that way as you can see pieces like this will be completely flat and secure it's a new day whoa you look like a model in this lighting I'm not kidding look at this look at lucky faces just how did that happen wait frankly a miracle come over here like how did it perfectly fit it's called God's favor my dear I'm so sorry Beauty here this deer enter now to do a splinter count to this video yeah this is number two splinter number two it's the only type of competition where I don't want a winner toady insisted on getting a ladder so he could get this one lemon even though there's a trillion lemons within normal reach Andy got it let's see if it was worth it this is the champion let me see wow that thing is gigantic   so basically these are 1 by 3 pieces of board that we actually cut a fence board in half to create and we just kind of nailed it together this is a little kind of centerpiece that just gives a little bit extra support and Lexi chose some gold accents you know she loves the horse and we even have gold screws we're dripping in gold there we go and then we're gonna chicken wire that so got the hinges on well got our little gold handle on and that's a door now okay this is our little nest section so we're gonna have a little piece of wood or something for the hens to walk up and this will be the nest area and we'll have the sort of egg grab door over here okay the egg box is coming together we made a little door you have the eggs still got to put the roof on she can survive without further new here we do here we go yeah it's kind of hard to without having seen the flashbacks of us building to like think of the fact that nothing was here because we have a full-blown Jacob now obviously we talked about it before but we built it into the lemon trees originally I was in the paint it white but I just kind of love how it blends in with its surroundings right now so we're leaving it as is and I'm gonna have Cody kind of talk a little bit about the bells and whistles of this thing I mean it's really country there's really not that much bells and whistles do it haha there's a couple bells all the things in bang okay I like a farmer coming so the number-one thing about a chicken coop my friends is efficiency okay now don't laugh babe all right you want this coop to be as low maintenance as possible okay we want to give the hens in their space you know we don't want to be coming out here every day watering them giving them food so we rigged up an automatic water system low-pressure water going into those little cups those little orange cups so the hens can just it now they're called nipples okay so I don't want to raise little things that they poke the little nips whatever you want to call them blue methane so they pick the little yellow nips okay sorry they pick the little yellow bless you the little yellow things and then water comes out and then water will sit in those cups shut up Raven so we have a 50-pound feeder over here and it holds a ton of food so if you have a couple hens you really will only have to refill that feeder maybe once a month or maybe even once every six weeks so that was the whole point of the coop was making it super low-maintenance so that we could go we could do our thing we don't have to come out here and feed them too much and we can just come and enjoy the yard and come and grab the eggs so if you didn't understand all that chickeny chat Here I am because I don't understand it either all I knew was you said nips one too many time I know I was bad so of course I had to make my chicken coop like a little bit glam and so we put on these gold accents on the coop voice so you know it's like my girls need to be taken care of and the cool thing about this chicken is we wanted there to be easy accessibility to the wavy thoughts you know because we don't want to have to like get all up in the coop to get the eggs so over here we have the nest with a trapdoor and this is where the girls will lay their eggs so whenever it's time to come get some breakfast all I got to do is say this is my fake egg and then you close it back up voila so we wanted the coop to have a lot of just kind of openness so there's actually no roof on the majority of this side of the coop but over here on top of the roosting area and of course the egg box we do have a metal roof we kind of outfit it a little custom cut in the middle so water will hit it'll run down and then run off here so the girls can stay dry if it ever rains but we do live in LA where it doesn't really rain that often so they should be pretty good Oh another thing we have a sand bottom which I've never done in a coop I've always had just either shavings or I don't know I would I would put down shavings or kind of straw but ever since we did sand I've been noticing it just feels a lot cleaner and the hens love it all right now it's time to meet les guy inna see hello girl tell us about these hens babe so this is a Rhode Island Red Hen they're a production layer so these girls lay a lot of eggs they'll lay 250 eggs a year Wow baby she's a little nervous right now because obviously she's new here this is her new farm but I can guarantee you she's in a better place than she was we're gonna take really good care these girls we're gonna give them their space they got their food 24/7 they got some sand in there to play in so when you move into a new coop it takes you know maybe even a week or two for them to kind of like be comfortable enough to lay so hopefully they calm down in the next few days and they can start producing eggs and they can just be comfy here you know really sweet so we're in the coop right here as you can see it's open over here and as we travel over to this side we're now in the covered area we have a little angled roof protected by chicken wire here and right here they have their little perch where they can sit on at night and if they need to go lay the egg box is right over there and it's an extension out of the coop so they can get up here and roost and then they can walk up these little steps which they've already done in the first few nights they've been living in this thing and they can lay in this little box right here and then there's our little access door right there we can get the eggs   alright guys if you liked this video give it a thumbs up me and Lexie are always working on new projects and we have a lot of big plans of this backyard we want to do a little hangout area over there maybe put in a fire pit maybe do a hot tub maybe means she really wants it ok cool thank you guys so much for watching and we will see you guys in the next one see you guys soon goodbye et's see if we can just tell just by looking this one right here is from the stove hey guys welcome back to our channel we are so happy you're here we have a really fun little challenge that we're gonna do later to put my coffee machine to the test and see if dropping all the bank was worth it or not but before we get to that we want to say a very special shout out and thank you to this video

lexi 80 and you can enter the code lexi 80. all right guys let's get into this video so lex tell us what we're doing today so you may or may not know that i bought a very bougie coffee oh we all know and so i was looking at my old method of making espresso which is this 15 maybe even less stovetop espresso maker and i thought it might be interesting to do a little taste test comparison i'm gonna do a blind test and have cody taste a latte from the 15 machine and from the thousand dollar machine and see if he can taste the difference and if he can which one's better well i'd be in so much trouble if the 15 stovetop machine is the winner you might have to return it babe because if you can make really good coffee with just a 15 way then i don't understand why we had to get such an expensive machine to do it babe you know it's brought me so much joy into my world not as much as you have brought me yeah okay tell me in my hair tell me in my ear oh he said he thinks the expensive one will for sure win oh of course he would say that look at him so if you've been watching us for a while or follow along on instagram you probably know by now that i am a coffee fanatic and that's because i'm cuban in my culture it's like you show your love through a little cafeto i recently got this beautiful god sent machine from heaven above and it makes such incredible coffee that i may or may not have shed a tear the first time i made a latte okay baby you're getting too connected to it so some of my favorite things about this machine are that it actually grinds your coffee as a built-in coffee grinder and it has a ton of different settings that you can choose from so that you can make sure you get the perfect grind you can also choose the grind amount or the dose for your baristas out there so you can make sure that the amount of coffee as well as the size of the grounds are perfect and then of course it has a steamer so that you can steam and froth your milk to perfection and over here we have the lovely very traditional very basic stove top espresso maker now in college in my past life this was a godsend and i still appreciate these little mocha pots because you can take them camping i've literally never been camping i don't know why i said that basically they're portable and um they make really good coffee in my opinion you have to be careful because you can burn the coffee but we're not gonna do that today obviously the fancy breville machine has a ton of bells and whistles that the moch pot does not have but we're not comparing the bells and whistles today we are just comparing the quality of the latte i don't know if i'm the right person to actually taste test this since i'm such a new coffee drinker but i have had it just about every day since you've had the machine and since before that so i think you're the perfect candidate because i think that i want to know if the average joe like you will be able to taste the difference or think one's better for the average person should you invest in a pricier coffee machine or not like is it worth it you know so we will find that out yep we gotta talk quality control for a second in order to make sure that this is a fair battle we are going to use the same espresso the same espresso grind and when it comes to the milk i'm actually going to use a separate coffee steamer that i have so that we don't actually make a difference when it comes to steaming on this machine versus not on this machine so those are independent variables or is it the dependent variables i don't remember i'm just drinking coffee so we're getting all scientific it's coffee babe it's just like you put it in there sugar variable is what doesn't change i remember now from many years ago so that would be the coffee and milk and the the dependent variable is the coffee machine before we get started i want to say being a barista is not as easy as you would think i would like to shout out all the baristas out there making the good coffee   so       see that honey starting to get a lighter color yeah all right just so you do something in this video do you want to go ahead and put the sugar in i'm doing something i'm holding the camera i'm filming you but yes i will i'll put some sugar put two teaspoons in each a teaspoon is this a teaspoon that's a really big teaspoon okay that's okay okay should i just do one yeah just do one since you did it ginormous there we go okay i like a lot of sugar all right now i need you to go away because i'm about to brew i'm about to brew the other coffee our mocha pots done and i'm gonna put them together and you can't see which one's which i'm actually gonna go grab john so we can come and do the taste test with me so john this is what we're doing dude lexi's making coffee from the very expensive coffee machine and then she's making it in i don't even know what the heck it's called what is the other deal eddie yeah she's making it in the cheap way and so we're gonna taste test this and we're just gonna see if we can identify what's the expensive one versus the cheap one great i have a feeling you'll be able to do it easily though right you're i don't know if it's the exact same yeah i feel like we'll both be able to figure it out all right let's hope so all right i'm literally going to measure out the amount of espresso to make sure that it's exact for each yep usually you'd want to put the espresso in first then add the milk but for the purpose of this experiment and you go i'm going to stir them and then bring them out you guys ready   let's see if we can just tell just by looking this one right here is from the stove and this one by just looking we'll see if you're right or not wait so stove is what you're saying and you're saying this is expensive yeah okay we'll try it out buddies i'll try this one i'm nervous oh shoot alright here we go so good let me just flip it this way okay all right   do you think you know i do i think i know oh god i'm not good at this man i gotta drink the other one but i don't want to say go ahead you know john's a much more experienced coffee connoisseur than cody all right here we go let's see   he can't tell hold on yeah okay i was wrong he wasn't an expert i just know that the better tasting coffee is that one that's the better tasting one i don't know if that means that because it just tastes better it's from the more expensive machine though okay but i let me i'm gonna try it one more time they're both good by the way you think no no this is the expensive yeah this one though this one is these ones you guys are right you can definitely taste what's interesting to me is i thought that the mocha pot would make a darker colored coffee but it actually the latte was lighter yeah and um it's much which is why john it tricked you in the beginning that that was the more it was from the expensive machine because it was lighter colored but do weaker as well and thinner even an unexperienced coffee drinker and a very experienced coffee drinker could tell the taste test difference i needed to taste it one more time this one though and when i tasted that one but what's funny is when you both originally tasted this one you thought it tasted i was like good good right then when i tasted this i knew it just tasted in the cream like this one tasted just better which is so interesting because the milk is done the exact same way so it's just the espresso it's the same thickening it's the same cup of coffee essentially except done better there is no comparison there's no for lexi okay same espresso same exact amount of espresso once it was made same sugar same milk preparation same everything that one wins by far all right so guys the verdict is that spend the money dude it's worth the money man it is i think that if i mean obviously it's an extravagant machine and it's very expensive five years ago i never would have thought that i would get such an expensive coffee machine or been like cool with spending that much but as someone who drinks coffee every day and sometimes four times a day it is a worthwhile investment and i've got to say i feel like that machine makes better lattes than i can get out a lot of the time so instead of going to like a coffee shop i sometimes just make my lattes at home now because it's it's better like i don't need to go to a coffee shop to get an incredible latte so it is going to save me money in the long run all right guys so we hope you love this video if you want to see more coffee content please
