hey guys welcome back Jordan is here yet again don't talk I just leave today's video is basically a life update um but more in-depth more detail kind of more serious we haven't done like a serious video together since our Christian assumptions video but yeah cool but T there's still a lot of T in that video but it's been a while since we've done something like that and there's been so much going on in our lives and I feel like even if I'm vlogging it you still can't really see everything that's going on so I feel like every once in a while I like to do a video where I'm just sitting chatting and updating you guys so that's what today's video is going to be if you guys been following Malena for any amount of time you'll notice that the last couple months have been extremely like transformative for us and in a good way but also in just a like major life shifting way too so kind of started with finding out we're gonna be parents for the second time that was really exciting then also me leaving my old job and kind of helping supporting milena and working here at home with her on some different business projects and things like that as well as YouTube and Instagram right yeah but then on top of all of that this pregnancy has been extremely hard because of my ulcerative colitis so people who have an autoimmune disease when they get pregnant either that autoimmune disease goes into remission which means it kind of goes away or it full-blown flares up and that's what's happened with me so it's been extremely hard to manage being pregnant and taking care of a one-year-old and then having to deal with my flare-ups and my all sort of colitis just like being at its all-time high because I'm pregnant so it would have happened like when I get pregnant just what happens that happened with ilithyia - at the end of my pregnancy with her so that has been a whole other thing so like the first week of January I think was spent us in the hospital so that was like it's just been a lot we thought you're just gonna go in for a couple hours and get a few you know pills or medication or whatever and then send her home we end up staying there for three days they did multiple blood transfusions and had a bunch of specialists coming and talked to her and basically put her through the works so that was kind of our start to the new year and my cousin Stefan in his wife Celeste came to move in with us - for just a little while but of course moving in and having another couple and another family even though they're my extended family just again was another shift something that we've never done before and there's really no manual on how to do this stuff so we're kind of just figuring it out as we go and really enjoying the process that the Lord is putting us on and things like that so we're just trying to figure it all out and one thing that milena and I really neglected in this last month or so was just spending time together as a husband and wife and really yeah pouring into one another so with babies and family and work stuff going on and all this it's very easy to kind of shelf your marriage in your relationship with your spouse yeah just very unintentionally like it's it's not like we wanted to like miss each other it was just kind of what happened so we've been trying to take some practical steps in more action on our part - yeah really focus on you know loving one another and serving one another and being very intentional about how we lift each other up in our marriage so yeah it's a lot of where we've been at the list yeah they're so so I'd say the first month of the year I first of all I can already believe that it's March I know because it's like March 2nd or something worse whatever 2030 is about to be way over after this move yeah that's while so when January hit when Jordan had been at home now so he wasn't going to his job anymore and then yeah so yeah I'm just deciding that together no how would I phrase that like that was my former job and I'm between jobs yeah but I can't really say too much about it so that's where I leave it Jordans an assassin okay so anyway so that happened come in the mob yeah I saw them get to figure out how to be at home with each other which we've never had to do in fact our life a year ago was very different from that we weren't living with each other because we were doing a long-distance for nine months so we went from basically of doing that to then being with each other all day long and all the time and then we added in having people move in with us and that was like a whole nother ship so for me at least the month of January was very stressful because I was having all my health issues which are now basically under control but it wasn't then and then that yeah just like being pregnant again and then figuring out like how to even do life with two other with another couple that is a big thing especially when you have a baby and just figuring out like okay who's gonna take care of the dogs who's gonna be cooking dinner who's gonna go grocery shopping like managing all these like tasks that like only Jordan I had to do now and like including someone else it is very complicated if you ever had to live with like a sister or brother or your mom or your dad like other than your spouse it's very different it took me a minute to like adjust to that but I remember in January I always would get frustrated because I wasn't communicating certain things to Jordan like I wanted to spend time with him that and her pregnancy hormones those two like combined pray for me knows do well and we kind of talked about this in our podcast that we did on our first year of being parenting was like miscommunication which is something I've noticed that I really struggle with it's not intentionally just Turkish communications on one-way street so well everyone not communicating to you what it is that I want so it's like since we had all been working together all day and then we would shift gears and do life stuff I don't know like cook dinner or whatever stuff outside of the work right yeah and then keep in mind we all work from home so we're all like together all day long for me I really had a hard time at night because I never felt like I had any time with Jordan unless we were sleeping and like literally in bed so the first couple of months or the first couple of weeks I feel like I kept getting frustrated cuz I know Jordan be like babe let's go take a shower because if you guys know like we love to shower together that's like our thing that we do and I'd be like babe let's go shower and like he'd be like okay one second and like him and stuff in order to be talking or he'd be doing something else and then I would just not want to wait because I want to sleep it 8:00 p.m. right in the middle of a very deep conversation and Malayan with justice I like that split second like alright I'm gonna get up a good shower I'm like okay but we're just like right in the middle of something so maybe give us 15-20 minutes or whatever so yeah that was just something that again me not reading something her not communicating it well even though we both do communicate I would say well for a couple that's only on your three you're too married yes that's another thing I was going to point out it's the amount of time that we've been married is not that long we're gonna be married for three years in the summer and that's pretty young like that's a young marriage we haven't been married for that long we haven't lived like that one either so I feel like oh there's just like a lot of like different life-changing things going on at once that was really starting to impact our marriage and our relationship so yeah well you were saying something and I know that's exactly right and I was just gonna add we feel like we've lived a lot of life in a very short amount of time not and this is not a complaint or or something like that it's actually work we're so blessed and thankful for all the things that God's given us and kind of given into our hand for us to manage and Stuart but it's kind of a lot that we weren't really trained for or again read a book on or got some sort of schooling or education on how to do all this right yeah sorry can I add and I'm top of all of this Jordan I had left our church so we weren't really like going to church yeah we were we were open to going somewhere else that the Lord led us we just were praying like God if you want to take us from where we've been at because we felt like we're very comfortable there we've been there since we were like four or five years old and we're kind of like are we staying here because it's comfortable and convenient or because God really wants us here so we kind of were in this place of exploring and just being open to wherever God would would put us in what happened honey well the Lord brought us back to that same church which was very reassuring because that meant that we the Lord wanted us there we weren't just there because we felt comfortable we didn't just go there because that's where we've got our whole life's like that was very reassuring for us to know like okay where we're raising a lengthy and the church and our future baby boy like this is where the Lord wants us to be not just because we want it to be they're more comfortable there so in one sense it may seem like wow that was like such a waste of time but for us it's been very satisfying to know that's what the Lord wants us so but in the middle of that time it took us what five months six months to kind of figure that out so not that we weren't going to church we still had our Bible study that we'd go to every week and different things that we were involved with but at the end of the day like we weren't fully into a church so in the midst of all this other stuff going on we weren't getting poured into we weren't getting like I don't know I feel like we were an empty cup trying to spill into other cups you know you don't saying what's that quote that's like an empty cup you can't pour into someone else when your cup isn't full older whatever it kind of like you can't love someone if you don't love yourself to everything I feel like that definitely added to all of this like all the just a lot okay a lot going on and we just want to talk about it because it's so easy for social media to make it look like people have their lives together and we know things could be so much worse they definitely could we know that we are we are very blessed lives but that doesn't take away from just like the daily things that happen just being parents just being married there's it's a lot there's a lot of other factors that play into that so definitely don't take that light all right so one thing that that we have done recently that has been new to us is counseling this is something I honestly have wanted to do this for a very long time and the only counseling Jordan I have done together before was our pre marriage class before we even got married yeah something like church yeah and that wasn't I don't even consider that counseling although it was very helpful I definitely feel like I should have gone to counseling like forever ago like when I was like freshen up high school or like even in high school I feel like I should have done that but I never did so from Elena needs kind of this idea of think of it like preventative maintenance that you would do on like your car like get your oil changed and tires rotated and all that stuff and why would you do something like that well there's nothing wrong with the car yet right but there could be an issue down the road if some of these smaller things aren't addressed right now yeah so small normal healthy you know conflict in trouble and conversations you might in arguments you might have with your spouse are very normal and very healthy actually it actually would not be healthy if you didn't have any conflicts because are you really engaging in a relationship with somebody if there's not some pushback or some disagreement right are you really hearing the other person are really valuing their yeah their perspective here so our whole point of doing this is the idea of preventing issues that could be you know snuffed out right now instead of letting them grow and fester and then later down the road whether that's a couple months a couple years even a couple decades annually especially with a newborn coming into the picture - um I think back in January it was faithful counsel he actually emailed me and reached out and we were so excited this was honestly an answered prayer because we wanted to do counseling but we like did not know where to start who who do you go to where do you find a counselor like who do you trust like that was something that to me was probably the biggest roadblock was I didn't know where to start I didn't know where to begin and I knew we wanted a Christian counselor because our faith plays such a large part of our lives that if we were to go to a counselor that wasn't a Christian I feel like we wouldn't be hearing each other the right way yes there's definitely a spiritual element and spiritual layer to this idea of your health and wellness mentally and emotionally and things like that so yeah we wanted it to come from the same understanding of we're operating from a biblical worldview just a little disclaimer faithful counseling is not a priceless line so we will have stuff link down below in case you guys are going through something right now we definitely want to be sensitive to that so I only resources down below in case that is that you're currently in those shoes um we definitely do not take that lightly so I didn't want to just add that disclaimer yeah faithful counseling this whole mission is to make professional counseling affordable accessible and convenient which was huge for us because we kind of have somewhat of a hectic schedule at times and maybe you're in a better position where you're able to have something a little bit more set and I can go pretty routinely and but for us it's great because we could just set up a video call or a phone call yeah or even just do a chatroom kind of thing yes so yeah just like what Jordan was saying they have four very convenient ways of doing it so for us we have the app where we do a video call but you can do it through a computer you can do it through your tablet or your mobile phone which is so useful and so handy we actually have ours we do it right here we'll just sit here and we'll do it on our phones and just have the chat if flow counseling is also available worldwide and all of their counsellors are in fact licensed therapists who are certified by their state board to provide therapy and counseling so these are legit people and the best thing is when you go to sign up you can select like how much of your faith you want incorporated in this so we definitely wanted biblical advice we definitely wanted scripture we definitely want to pray with you yes yeah which is so cool like I think that's amazing so we were so excited when they said that they wanted to sponsor video and work with us because it truly has been such a cool gift to us and so useful and I think so many people need to know about this because if you're like us we wanted to we just didn't know where to start we just didn't know who to see they're also monthly based so you can get a lot more in than if you were just doing like sessions and paint per session so it ends up being very cost effective it's a lot more affordable so I will link everything it down below for you guys we do have a code where you guys can save some money as well I definitely don't think this is something you'll want to pass on pass off on especially if this is something that you've been wanting to do I just can't encourage it enough it has been so helpful to us and we are going to continue doing these sessions and she was so sweet I don't know if I should I realized to talk about what we talked about yeah I mean like you're gonna give generalities oh yeah I don't know if there's any like privacy things okay well I mean it had me privacy on my own self so I think it's fine so she helped us with communication which was like something that we said we struggled with but she was like right off the bat when we were in our conversation she was like sending us worksheets and sending us like different documents of like different ways it was in real time so we could have the sheets that we're looking at as she's explaining things and that's something too when you think of like well I know my spouse better than anybody else right or at least I should but then to communicate and have conversations of depth and substance with them it's a little bit harder as especially as you get older like you how to get into a routine and kind of like oh hey how is this or what would you think is a very it becomes very like chlorine yeah loses the luster so having a therapist or counselor that can help stimulate some of those conversations that really matter just does wonders for your marriage jealously well Eve my life changing and having someone else like to talk to as well not just ourselves because she was able to point out and see a couple things that we didn't notice or realize so just having like a third party like not with any bias come and talk to us too so I guess for us that has been very very helpful because I don't want and like people say this to like why would you get married so younger why are you married like why didn't you just not get married like because a lot of people have seen marriages that have failed people who are married but are miserable and just don't want to be married and why would we want that for yourself so you know it's so we really want to focus on our marriage and focus on each other and just the conversations that we have after that to have been extremely helpful and have like sparked stuff in us too that like we haven't really felt in a minute so yeah we're just thankful to have somebody else to pour into us and to speak into us somebody that we have a comfort comfort durability go I was comfortable talking to her like right off the bat comfortability yeah she was so sweet like I felt comfortable right away so kind of in addition to doing that one thing that I started realizing is how much I miss our old house and I was trying to like dig into like why that was and I think it was just the season of life that we were in and how simple life was back then even though it was like six months ago um I just really missed that so there's a simplicity that came with our starting out like first home newly married you know Alethea was a lot younger too which she didn't require as much as she does now like we've added Daleks and kids and yeah a little bit more room for us to grow into so yeah it's been like a lot and like I kind of what I was doing I was watching some of my old videos and I was like wow like I really had life together back then it's like it does not feel like that now so I felt like the past six months I haven't grown if anything I've gone the opposite direction which is never something that I want so for me it was really important for me to look back at those videos not like in an unrealistic way but like I was motivating myself like I was like this one's white why aren't I still like this you know so hey you can't be too hard on yourself because your mom now I know but I'm just saying that there's a lot that comes with that you don't have to shoulder I know but also like I build really bad habits recently like my phone time guys like my what is it screen time has been really high lately no comment I recently got into Tim talk which like if you have a tick-tock you know how like time-consuming that can become like I'd have nowhere so just like I started to build bad habits and like I would have thought like oh it's the new year I was gonna build new habits healthy habits which was my intention our word of the year this year is discipline and let me tell you I've had everything except for discipline I feel like because we set that word as reaching yeah God is like funny discipline you don't you're gonna I'm gonna challenge you in every way to use discipline yeah working on it yeah it's a progress and that's something to that we're gonna get into as we kind of talk about some of these similar conversations on our podcast in the coming month but everything's a progress a process right yeah there's there's not like a quick okay go um I was just going to say like I've noticed myself building really bad habits another old house I had really good habits in small little habits that I didn't realize we're really impacting my day and making my day very productive and just so much better and now that I'm doing these really bad habits I'm seeing the effects of that too so um I'm gonna change that and fix that and like make more of an effort like yesterday I was telling Jordan that my goal for this week is to bring down my screen time by at least an hour day because I think right now it's at like 5 hours which is a lie I know I work for my phone but it's still a lot and I don't I don't have five hours in a day to be staring at a screen I have other things to be doing that's something that I want to do is like change that habit but let me know if you guys want me to do a whole video on habits because they really are so important and really structure you and structure your day okay it'd be great for me I don't know about you I want to see a video on how little in it does things I need to figure it out I need to go back and watch my old videos and see like little habits that I used to do I obviously have a couple of Mines but let me know if that's something you'd be interested in or I can just keep it to myself and just do it and then I'll let you know how it goes yeah as you were saying oh oh just how everything is a process right especially we're talking about counseling and relationships and kind of checking in and things like that like oh you take process yeah it's not like well it's not like I'm trying so what I mean is say somebody has some mental health issue that they're struggling with it's not like okay here read this book and you're good or go to five sessions of therapy and then you're all set and like magically healed right like this horizon idea of like well once we get here or once you've complete this then you're good right it's a process there's a lot it's very complex so whether that's your relationship or you personally or whatever it might be you know there's so much to it that I think we do a disservice if we just say hey just do this or just do that or just change this or just pull yourself up by your bootstraps right there's so much more to it the habits is just one of the steps mm-hmm the therapy is a big step to that way it's multiple things that I'm trying to actively do to like get yeah like counseling is a great option to help start unpacking and categorizing the steps we need to be taking um even if it's not like a hair do this and then you're good it's at least putting you on the right path to understanding some things or healing or whatever it might be that you're you know you're struggling with her need need help with so yeah we we just yeah so that's that's been our experience that's our update we don't want to sound like really down or anything or too serious and this part is light-hearted great weird silly but I really hope you guys enjoyed this update and in our podcast coming up this whole month of March we're gonna be focusing on some more conversations of surrounding like mental and emotional wellness and things like that so stay tuned for that coming up I'll link our podcast up below as well if you guys haven't heard it yet but you love you guys and see you in my next episode in the episode sorry I'll see you guys in my next video bye hey guys today's video wasn't really planned but after seeing it yesterday's video and your guys's feedback I definitely thought this would be something that was necessary I didn't really want to address this just like in the comment section and just like pin my comment I definitely thought this topic was something that was worth making an entire video about and just giving you guys that respect I am very thankful to those of you who did give back any positive feedback and just criticism you guys were very sweet in the way that you did it in your approach so I like I really really appreciate that because I know a lot of people will just send hate comments and obviously that's not received as well so those of you who did get back to me some of you were about there by the videos and then others of you weren't so I just overall thought I would just kind of do this video I do have quite a bit of notes of like what I want to kind of go into detail first I'll talk about that specific video and kind of explain everything and then I thought I would do more of like a behind the scenes and kind of explaining sponsorships in a way that I think a lot of people don't understand or haven't heard from and kind of give you guys our behind-the-scenes look of what it goes through and kind of what that process looks like and kind of like my rules and guidelines of for sponsorships because I don't ever think I've shared that which I definitely should have a while ago and my channel I will put a timestamp here in case you guys are curious or just kind of laying it up I tried my best not to be badly in this I really don't want to do that so I do have quite a bit of notes I'm gonna try my best to like timestamp and like stick to everything let's just get into it so yesterday's video was a sponsorship with faithful counselling and it was kind of like a life update some of you didn't even care like didn't even think twice about it and then not there's a view seem to be very bothered that that video was sponsored by them and based off of your comments I saw that you guys thought it was system genuine or I was only making that video because it was being sponsored so I thought I would just address everything here to begin faithful counselling had reached out back in January maybe even December and they had wanted to work together and like I mentioned in the video it honestly was an answered prayer because Jordan I have been wanting to do counseling since before we even got married we've never had a chance to do it we didn't know how to go about doing it mentioned it in the video but like I don't know where to find a counselor no one I know has done counseling my sister has but we specifically wanted to do marriage counseling but we wanted a Christian counselor so like there's a lot of things that we're playing a part of like why we weren't doing it so when they reached out I was like this is so cool I was so excited and I've never worked with a Christian company before and this was the first Christian company that I was gonna be working with it was just very excited so to be honest I was actually a little surprised with the feedback that I got because I thought this was like probably the most on brand sponsorship I could do because there are Christians it's counseling it's something that I think a lot of people would have loved to hear about and get to know about so I was a little bit surprised one thing not a lot of people were saying was like oh well you're only doing counseling because you're getting paid to do it and that's not true at all matter of fact most of these companies that you work with it's not even a requirement to try their product as silly as that sounds I would never promote something or talk about something unless I loved it experienced it went through it and have generally positive things to say about it from myself not from what they want me to say I want my own experience and this was the exact case for this and that was one of the first things we asked them was okay this sounds amazing we really want to try it can we try it for three months before talking about it can we explore on this can we like what can we do to really get to know this and use it ourselves because we want to use it and utilize ourselves that's like the whole point of this they were able to do that and we're still doing counseling like we have another counseling appointment tonight I've been doing it we frequently do it so I thought it was important to mention that that was not a requirement to even talk about that but because we genuinely wanted to do counseling that's why and we didn't do counseling just because they reached out we've been wanting to do counseling even if they didn't want to work with me and even if they weren't paying me to do that video I still would have mentioned it and talked about it because I genuinely used it and liked it and appreciated it so I didn't do the video because it was sponsored I would have done that video regardless and mentioned it and talked about it so that's something I just wanted to clear the air about I definitely think there's a huge stigma around sponsored content and influencers doing sponsored things and I think the reason for that is because there are such a handful of influencers that love and do what they do because they love it and then you have a couple of those sour apples that do it because of the money and that is it and they have honestly ruined it for a lot of other people there's quite a lot of people that just are not in it for the wrong reasons you can tell they're in it for the wrong reasons and it really sucks because they've put a really bad reputation on the rest of us and then everyone kind of feels sour about sponsorships so I kind of thought I would do more of like a behind-the-scenes and kind of just openly talk to you guys about sponsorships like I said I should have done this a long time ago but I thought right now would be a really good time to do it most of the time I think a lot of people don't understand that I disclose every single sponsorship on YouTube on Instagram I always disclose that a lot of people do not and they are able to get away with it how I don't know and so I think a lot of other creators you might not even realize that a video is sponsored but it is and they're getting paid to do it and you don't even realize it or know it soon as someone says that it's sponsored people go oh okay but other people will do a video and not mention that it's sponsored and it will go completely unnoticed so that is just one thing that I thought I would throw out there along with that I do consider myself a smaller youtuber I'm not a micro youtuber but I'm not a larger like I'm somewhere in the middle I'm still growing I am a smaller Channel and I saw a lot of people talk about Adsense and like mentioned how while aren't you getting paid for Adsense and guys Adsense I'm telling you YouTube does not pay well I'm talking my videos will make anywhere between twenty to fifty dollars which with the amount of time that goes into filming editing prepping it's ten plus hours twenty dollars is not a lot and that's because I am a smaller influencer okay like Shane Dawson probably gets 20 million views per video like he's making good amount of money on Adsense but like for me it is not a lot at all so I think people have a misconception when it comes to Adsense Adsense is kind of like a bonus so I don't really treat it as income kind of like if you got a bonus every year or something like that kind of what we treat Adsense as it's not reliable it's not consistent and it's not a lot another thing I think a lot of people don't realize is I don't have any merch I don't have my own company I don't have my own things to promote which a lot of larger youtubers do have even though a video might not be specifically sponsored by a company the influencer might still be promoting their merch their own presets that they launched their own website or their own links like there's always something that people are promoting whether you realize it or not I am working on my own merch I am working to get to that point I've been trying to watch my own merch for so long but I'm so picky about it that it's been taking a long time but I think a lot of people don't realize that even though a video is it specifically sponsored you're still being quote-unquote like sold things or people are still mentioning other products and other ways of making revenues that I would disclose that and mention that because I don't think people realize it this is kind of very similar how like TV and radios and just basically everything that you watch nowadays is somewhat monetized whether it's on the radio and you're watching or listening to something or if it's on Pandora like there's always some type of thing so I think people are definitely like aware that that's happening just think with influencers it tends to be a little bit different because there's a lot more integrity that goes into that so I will go into that very short to go through like my list of like how I accept or decline a sponsorship and what that looks like another thing so this is something that some of you have pointed out that is true so some of you have been shin that I've taken on more sponsorships and that is true not every video sponsored that is absolutely false maybe every three to four videos they're sponsored but not every single video is sponsored maybe just of the ones that you're watching but I promise you they are not all sponsored I won't do that I don't do that I don't also put like 15 to 20 ads in each video which you can do to make your ad Adsense increase but that's annoying as a consumer myself like when I'm watching youtube video and it's paused every two minutes like that is annoying to me so I would never do that to you guys keep in mind like I watch you to myself I will buy from people and influencers as well like um the biggest thing that I play into everything is that I myself am a consumer I myself consume youtube and watch influencers and stuff so a lot of like what goes through my mind I apply into what I do because it's just common sense I do what I would like to receive so that's just maybe obvious but definitely put that into consideration too if like I watch YouTube as well and I know what people like what people don't like I've noticed I pick up on things that people get irritated with I get irritated with those oh I don't do those things so yes I have taken on more sponsorships and normal there have been some really great opportunities to work with these brands that I never in a million years thought I would ever work with most of the time I'm reaching out to them because I love their product and love their stuff and I really want to share with you guys about it but in case we all forgot I'm going to be having a baby in three months maybe even less maybe two months because I am considered a high-risk pregnancy there might be a higher chance of him coming earlier but I am pregnant I think a lot of you looking for getting that I don't get a maternity leave I don't get a paid maternity leave I get paid as I work so the past couple of weeks I have been taking on more because I will be taking a break not from YouTube but during that time of my maternity leave I'm still gonna be posting still going to be doing all of that but none of that is gonna be sponsored because a lot more work goes into sponsored videos and I would rather just vlog and take that time off and just enjoy it and just enjoy that time with you guys preparation for that that is why there has been more than usual um I don't really get a maternity leave so the past couple of months I've been trying my best to be smart and strategic about it so that is the explanation for that all right now the tea juicy pot here is kind of like my rules of when to work with brand or not to work with a brand a lot of you probably realize that I work with the same brands frequently and the reason for that is because I have found brands that I love and genuinely use every single day a lot of you guys have enjoyed it and really loved them as well so I keep working with them because it's beneficial to all of us it's a win win win so when for me because I'm able to share with you guys these products it's a one for the brand because they're able to get a new audience and then it's a win for you guys because you're able to get exposed these brands but also get really good deals and savings and discount codes most of the time I would say about 80% of the time I reach up to a brand like I said I'm a consumer myself so I'm always looking out for products that make my life easier better simpler products that I really like enjoy we'll use with Lacey I will use for myself we use postpartum I'm always looking for really good companies 99% of the brands that email me and reach out to me I declined if you ask my assistant she will tell you that all of her emails are thank you no thank you most of them are just saying we're not available at this time we don't see this as a great partnership that other than a 99% of them isn't no 1% that I consider or would like to do I'm gonna walk you guys through kind of like what that looks like so right off the bat I'm gonna share with you guys sponsorship said I will absolutely not take never have taken it won't take you don't go to go first our fitness um tea companies or like what what I don't even I don't want to like name any of them but you know what I'm talking about the teas that like you're supposed to take and like lose weight I will never promote that that is so bad for your body and not at all what I would ever do so those will be in my emails literally every week and we've told them very kindly like we do not stand for what you stand for and I will not promote your stuff I am sorry I do not agree with that so that is one thing teeth whitening companies I've never promoted them will never promote them I don't know I've tried some of them but my teeth like will get stains I have like this thing on my tooth that if i whiten it it like shows up and i don't like that so if i'm not gonna use that because it does that to my teeth I'm not gonna promote it to you guys and encourage you guys to do it because I don't like it so I'm not gonna promote it another thing gaming apps that's not like on brand with me at all I don't do gaming I don't do that so I won't promote companies like that I feel like those are frequently in my emails as well but you know thanks I don't really do that next up and this is definitely new to my list is clothing companies that are unethical I've recently mentioned in my wardrobe video or my capsule wardrobe video that I'm trying to shop more sustainably more as and like I said in that video it's a process and I'm learning it I'm trying my best to be very selective of the clothing companies that I promote because I don't want to support anything that's unethical so this is something that's new to my list but moving forward that is a big thing for me so those are the don'ts those are the do's that right off the bat like don't even think twice about saying yes now I'm gonna go kind of through once I see that there's a company that I like this is kind of the stuff that I will go through it and like I said I'm a consumer myself like these are products that I use and would like to use first of all I will not promote anything that I don't use myself have used or loved and genuinely use like right off the bat everything that I've promoted like home chef we use home chef every other week we love it we've used it for a very long time my vitamins I have taken for the past two years with both my pregnancies that's something I'm going to promote and just genuinely talk about right up I love thredUP I order from them all the time whether they sponsor video or not sponsor video like as a consumer I shop from there all the time I love to thrift I don't always have time to go to the thrift store and spend three hours so I'll just do it online on thredUP there's tons of companies that I work with that I just genuinely use myself whatever they want me to talk about it in a video or not I do and use so right off the bat it needs to be something that will make my life better and make my life easier I feel like that's I do more like lifestyle stuff because that's just what I personally consume more next thing that I take very high into consideration is the price point of these items for example last week or two weeks ago Celeste sent me these PJ sites that wanted to work with me and I was like oh those are really cute so she sent me a website I was like looking through their stuff I never heard of the company but I wanted to see what it was about and the PJ sets were $200 a set and I was like no thank you I would not pay that and I cannot assume others would pay that price either I've not heard of this company it looks really cute but I'm sorry that price point I really cannot I can't I can't go with that price point so I was I turned out in that brand because why would people spend $200 maybe people do I don't know but I personally don't so I wouldn't I wouldn't promote something if wouldn't be buying it myself so right off the bat I sit sorry that's way too high of a price point next thing is discount code I always ask what the discount code is for you guys some companies don't even offer discount codes some offer really good discount codes of like 50% off if you try something so I always put that into consideration because it's a win-win for all of us like I said you guys are able to get a really good discount I get your feedback if you see a company that you really like I've had some of you messaged me and asked me like hey have you ever worked with this brand or do you have a code with them and I'm always down to reach out to them or if I've worked with them before to share that code with you codes are not affiliated and less stated it's not an affiliate so like literally on basically 99% of the time it's just a code that saves you guys money it's not an affiliate that I get at the end of the day if it is it is stated in the description box it is stated everywhere else you guys always know that I've kind of mentioned it before but I need to try the product there have been some companies that I've heard of before that I've seen at Target or that I've seen other influencers talk about it and I'm like okay they have a good reputation but I want to try it myself I want to try it for a month I want to try it for two months I want to make sure that I really like it and understand this product and genuinely use it and genuinely have a love for it most of the time they give you products so you can try it out yourself but sometimes they don't or sometimes they'll give it to you but then want you to review it that same week I always say nope I need at least a month like I need to try this out a lot not just in one week so that is something that I always consider and then I always just get feedback from you guys - some of you will tell me like you love care of you love other things you love other companies that I've worked with a lot of it is from feedback from you guys on what you guys have really enjoyed yourselves as consumers and me as myself like what what am i enjoying what am i genuinely using and that is what I will promote and talk about I hope that kind of helps you guys understand the back end of things and how things work like I said there are so many sour apples that have really ruined it for a of us and a lot of people that are in this for the wrong reasons my mindset is if I love a product and use it myself then I will promote it a lot of other people have it the other way of well how much are they gonna pay me or how much can I get out of this company how much are they gonna send me like how much can I get then I'll promote that a lot of people have it backwards and I am NOT one of those people I am very specific about who I work with I'm very specific about who I talk about and I don't just make videos to talk about a product I would have made that video regardless if it was sponsored or not I would have mentioned that we were doing counseling regardless if they were sponsoring it or not I have such a love for YouTube I expressed this to you guys all the time I love making videos I love the artistic side of it I love editing I love creating that is just my favorite thing ever and it has been a huge blessing that I'm able to do this and it's because of you guys and you guys have trusted me and I love when I see and you guys tag me in something and you enjoy it yourself and it was something that you guys saw that I promoted like that makes me so happy because then I know that I did my job I did my research I did like I spent my time in this I spent my time getting like knowing that people are gonna enjoy this because I've really enjoyed it so it makes me so happy when you guys give me good good feedback of like oh wow like I love these bars like these are so yummy it's changed everything your oh these vitamins have been able to help me with this or help me with that like it just makes me very happy when you guys give me that feedback and trust me with that so I really hope this video clarifies all that to guys um that last video I honestly didn't expect that backlash at all but I really do appreciate the criticism this is like exactly why I do this and why I have such a respect for you guys because you're we're all comfortable with each other and we're all able to just talk and just be open with each other so that is like the whole point of my channel is just being honest didn't mean for it to come across as disingenuous for marriage is struggling our marriage was struggling we are working on our marriage I think every marriage will struggle that wasn't meant to be clickbait t at all that is just what we're going through right now and if you saw the video we definitely go into folding tale as to why yes we have three dogs here a lot of you suggested that in the first couple of minutes of the video to say that it's sponsored instead of like halfway into the video or whenever the integration is which I can definitely do let me know what you guys want moving forward because the thing is like I don't want to just like make this video and then not do anything about it I definitely want to help you guys and you guys help me let me know down below what it is that you think is like a good thing and a good action step to do moving forward so that we're not running into this dilemma again and not it can be as transparent and honest for you guys the end of the day that means everything to me so hope you guys enjoyed this video hopefully you can see where I'm coming from and kind of get like a behind-the-scenes look of how everything works those online notes I love you guys I really appreciate you thank you for your positive feedback and I will see you guys in my next video hey guys welcome to my channel my mommy is

and welcome to today's flag so I'm gonna get back into flocking and like actually vlogging what's going on in my life and then in our days as you guys saw our morning routine I am just going to get just present day there's actually having a pretty bad migraine this morning so I took some medicine and I was putting the heating pad on so certainly after we eat Jordan came upstairs with Lily yeah played with her a little bit in the playroom now she's taking her nap I actually hear her she hasn't fallen asleep just yet but when she goes down for her morning nap around 9:00 usually one will get ready for the day I try to get ready before that but sometimes it doesn't work and when she's awake I try to be with her as much as I can so I'm gonna quickly do my makeup and get dressed and then we will start our day today um my mom is coming over so she comes over on Tuesdays and Thursdays to help with Alethea and I have a couple of work-related things to do I really want to organize our pantry today cuz it has been such a hot mess and then I want to show you guys Alethea dancing because she's recently been dancing if you follow me on instagram I posted about it and it is the funniest thing ever so I want to get that and I want to show you guys that she's walking now to she's not fully walking all the time but like she'll get up and like start walking a couple steps walking over here walking over there a couple bit so I want to show you guys that I here is like absolutely crazy I've actually been documenting it's like a journal of like how I use my natural hair and today's gonna be the last day we vlogging that so in this vlog I will vlog me vlogging for that video so this will that video will be up on Friday this one is going up on Wednesday so that vlog that one will be up after this so stay and look up for that video if you guys are curious if like why I do to like get longevity out of my curly hair I try to go 5 to 6 days without washing it so I will have that that video will be up pretty soon but I'm just gonna quickly get ready cuz I am looking cray is the     right after we put a lethea down for her first nap she actually threw up again so if you guys saw on Instagram like we've been really sick and we all cut like a really bad stomach bug and Jordan I were throwing up Alethea was throwing up and then she was fine she just randomly threw up during her nap so I feel really bad she's falling back asleep right now so it's been a little bit of a hectic morning I'm trying to like catch up with everything so I'm glad I actually woke up early and before her and I was able to get my things done because I didn't do that I wouldn't have had a chance to do it yet so biggest thing for me that has been very helpful lately is to wake up before lethea does and get my things done I feel like I get a good head start on the day but I'm still drinking my coffee it's like 11:00 I'm still not done but yeah Jenny is just gonna be a vlog so I I need to finish this first so I can think and start to think I need to go downstairs clean either grab my lipstick and lip gloss and like I want to start taking everything out of the pantry to like organize before my mom gets here so let's go do that all right my mom is here now hi mm-hmm so we took out everything from the pantry and we tried to keep everything together so for example like these are all the cans we tried to keep like all the bone broth together like we tried to keep everything in like sections and then my mom just went in and is cleaning it cuz it was so dusty and so gross so it's completely bare now and so much better trust me I know this pantry is like such an excessive size at our old house we didn't even have a pantry so I'm very thankful for this wine but like I know it's big it's very it's like not necessary but it was one of our favorite like selling points of the house because we're able to keep like appliances and like other stuff cleaning supplies like all of that and there we have like an actual space for it so we're gonna go through right now and look and see like what still needs like storage I have these that I got as a wedding gift these are the oxo containers so I like to like store stuff in theirs to keep it fresh but also because it like looks pretty so I'm gonna see and like walk through and see what else I can add like I want to do my sugars and flour and all of that and those two and getting me bins and like cuz right now I don't want to put everything back the way it was cuz it's just gonna get messy again so we're gonna try to declutter get rid of some stuff anything that's expired and then go to Ikea and see if we can get more storage for it excuse me naigus hi are you up for me announcer there yeah you feeling okay nice and jell-o's you tell me huh no are ya   thank you it is reacts in the water and you're all happy ideas yeah   okay so I was able to find quite a lot of stuff I knew I wouldn't idea has really good like glass stuff so I got some larger ones to put like flour or like oats and stuff got a couple smaller ones I got like some cute baskets they have some really cute lids as well and then I found these little guys that I thought were so stinkin cute so we're gonna kind of to play around with everything and see what we are going to use and I figured these we can put any like chips or anything inside of these as well like you to see won't stop crying pretty well we thought miss ilithyia was sleeping and then she started crying again I don't know if she's sleeping again but poor baby tell me what's so sad cuz I can't do anything about it especially was like a stomach ache like her doctor doesn't really know what we should do I see so many dear look yeah it's a beautiful day today it has been so nice and Michigan normally it's so cold and so gloomy out and just gray every day like we'll go weeks without seeing the Sun but it's been like in the 40s and 50s and sunny and I've been going out with the dogs walking with Lacey I'm just getting more exercise and fresh air and it feels really good I did have a migraine like about an hour ago but it took some medicine I put like a hot compress am I not gonna feel a lot better so gonna start helping my mom cuz when you if you struggle with migraines you know what it's like but like you feel like you're in a fog and you're like in a daze alright mom like you feel like you're not there like you can't you cannot focus and I feel like I've been like I've liked the past couple of hours I was kind of like kind of once we started going to like once we left for IKEA is when I started to feel like that and I woke up with a migraine actually I don't even know if I said that already but I did wake up with one but I took medication and did the heating pad thing but like it came back so some of you suggested acupuncture which I'm so down to try some of you said magnesium which I've done before and just like other things so water to a lot of you suggested water you can also do chiropractic care so back to organizing my mom is killing it she's like basically done were organizing and I have everything out I've wanted to show you guys this collagen that I've been taking for the past three months so kariv is working on this portion of today's video with me but they started making this over a year ago about three months ago they sent out these for us to try out and I have loved it it tastes so good this favorite is the lemon passionfruit so you put two scoops of this in your water and it's just like a collagen and it's very similar to how their vitamins are where you can go onto the website take a short quiz and let them know what it is that you want so whether you want to work on like your dry skin or your nails if you want to grow out your nails your hair you guys have noticed how much my hair has grown and oh and it's because of this guy and I love that it's gluten free dairy free natural flavors everything is organic there's such like good ingredients and the stuff they spent a long time curating it and that was like for a good reason so I will take this with two scoops so it's because it's flavored I'll just put it in my water I did actually just order one that's unflavored to see if I like it with my coffee because then I just wanted to try that out and see if that would work as well so they do have different flavors unflavored if you're interested in that too it'll be the link down below for you guys if you want and if you use code milena 50 you can get 50% off which is like a really big savings so if you guys have been wanting to try something collagen is just so good for your skin and I just love all the ingredients that they have in this thing too like okay there's no milk no eggs no peanuts no fish no soy oil no sheep shell shell shellfish soy or wheat allergens which i think is amazing because i feel like a lot of people are allergic to quite a few things and yeah I like this a lot if kariv did a really good job with this so I'll leave that link down below but   almost I know it seems like a lot like when you look at it's like wow how is this all in the pantry but it was somehow oh please it like oh he's doing she is not feeling it see what so I'm trying to get her some applesauce right now because it's like light on her stomach but she won't eat an apple size directly so only eat it if I put it on her binky think what right my dad you didn't Amun why you do this to me so she's been super up her schedule today we shall take to two hour now yeah that's what she calls Delilah we called Delilah and Nana just like her nanny and it sucks oh she's so scared good you don't get ya   so this morning when she went down for her first nap is when she threw up and so she like was in there yeah yeah she was in there she didn't actually fall asleep and then she threw up and it's so bizarre because when she throws up she doesn't throw up in her crib she throws up on the side so like it's Nana c'mere where's Delilah so she didn't I'm not taking her nap because she threw up in the middle of it so after that we were able to get her to go back down and then she was awake after that and then we went to Ikea and all of this and then my mom came know me grabbed it tried feeding her she hasn't really eaten much today because I can't imagine like her stomach is upset you know she's been throwing up but she's been drinking water so that's been good she like she loves to drink but then she like ate some of her tea berries I tried giving it some jello she had jello before we left but like she's exhausted and so then we put her down for her second nap and she went down she didn't throw out or anything thank God but she just is fighting it cuz I think her stomach hurts so her doctor just said for me to double her probiotic that she's been taking what she'd only take um but yeah look how sleepy she is this is sweeping this show stays that she's done when she's not done and so pull unlike those that I'm done no you know that are you are done no all right final review or reveal everything is just placed where it needs to be and then we'll make everything like look more pretty more aesthetic later on but this changed a lot if I found this at create a nut cream barrel I found this at the Container stored about a couple weeks ago and it changes and save so much face cuz commands in all of these tea bags this is like I doubled up so that would have been so many unnecessary space taken up so I like that a lot and I able to try my best to see if I can find links to everything this fours like the baskets but everything is mainly from Ikea like I wasn't I don't know how old these have to be to be in dance classes for for dance classes I feel old I used to be a gymnastics teacher and if kids were over 18 months they could be in class so I feel like maybe dance is the same I don't know I've enrolled her in swimming classes though some very excited about that but that is gonna be all for today's vlog it's already about 6 o'clock I'm gonna go put the jogs out so I just sped them that's probably what we'll do walk them about four to five times a day just because there's so many of them and we don't have a fence so I've been enjoying it though because it's been so nice out because I can actually walk and it's sunny and it's nice so I will leave a link down below for care of if you guys are interested in your collagen I love you guys so much and I will see you in my next video hey guys I'm so so excited about today's video so for the past week I documented basically everyday what I did with my hair when I wear it natural I wish I had this video to watch because it's taken me so many years to kind of figure out what works for my hair and kind of like what to even do so when I wear my hair now chill I'm with the mindset of I don't have to do anything for my hair I'm not spending more than two minutes on it everyday because if I have to spend any more than five to ten minutes doing my hair I might as well just like actually do it and style it and all of that so for me it's like all or nothing basically are you guys like this - I don't know maybe I'm the only one for me just like my natural hair means I'm doing minimal work to it I don't want to have to deal with it I'm just focusing on my makeup in my outfit every day and my hair is like my at least of my concerns I thought I would kind of document and show you guys six days of what that looks like and how I get the longevity out of it how I'm able to wash it and not have it be all greasy and also how do I keep styling it so my hair isn't like the same every time so it may seem a little deceitful because my hair is straight in this intro which is like very ironic because I literally never straighten my hair it's my first time straightening it in probably over three months when it is natural it is more of a wavy I do have a little bit of curl here in there I definitely think I could work on getting my curl back because when I was a baby I had actual curls like my hair was very curly but as I've gotten older and as I applied heat to it and all of that it definitely has lost its curl I know there are so many different methods that you can do but to be honest I'm kind of lazy so I kind of just work with what I have and what it looks like correct hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure to give it a thumbs up if you guys want more hair style videos like this or just what you guys like and let me know what other videos you guys would like to see and let's go ahead and get into it so day 1 before even day 1 even starts I will wash my hair so when I wash my hair I wash it at night before I wash my hair I will brush my hair and I know this can be a little controversial as to like how you brush your hair what kind of tool you used to brush your hair for me I honestly just used like those normal one like the wet one was that what it's called wet wet brush or whatever the ones that are like supposed to be really soft some people say you should be using wooden ones you know just do what you want to do and what works for you I will just lightly brush it out and this is the only time I brush my hair I repeat right before I get into shower is the only time I ever brush my hair you will never see me brushing my hair outside of me about to get into the shower I just don't do it it ruins my waves it ruins the way it looks it makes it look really frizzy so I just do not do that and then I'll wash my hair I use function of beauty shampoo it's like purple I love the color it smells really good and then when I get out I will apply minimal product because we're trying to go as long as we can without washing it and so the more products you put in it the more buildup there's gonna be in the grease here it's gonna get is what I have learned with my hair and a lot of the stuff is just like what has worked with for me it might not work for you but I mean it's worth it to give it a shot it's taken me quite a few years to figure out like exactly how to do this I like to sleep with my hair wet the reason for that is because I think my hair just looks better it's not frizzy if I go to bed and my hair is dry it just doesn't look as nice I don't know my sister is the opposite she has to have her hair fully dried before she goes to bed so again it's just a personal thing for me I like to go to bed with my hair wet I think it looks a lot better in the morning it's not as frizzy more curls I get more waves it's just like the structure of it holds a little bit better so I'll put either an oil in it or I'll put a serum and then just slightly crunch some of the curls again very minimal stuff because when I do most of the things it will be in the morning the next day when I wake up now is where it will pick up with each day going by this is kind of just like the pre daily vlogging journaling of my hair so now you guys will see day one and like what I do each day moving for it so have fun I hope you like alright hello guys good morning it is the next day so make sure you guys what my hair looks like so this is basically it honestly I don't have all that much like phrase at the top I would just say it's like all these little baby hairs and then you can see I would say I have more curls underneath and then the tap is more like waves I know my hair could be better but I'm very lazy so I just basically just do what kind of works for me so today is day 1 wear it the way that it is I'm not gonna put any key down I'm not going to really do anything I'm just going to use products to kind of maintain this top part and kind of fix all of that I'm just going to quickly show you guys the products that I use and that's it today one is pretty simple it's just setting us up for the rest of the week it's honestly very simple if I feel like my hair looks kind of dry I will put more of this hair serum it's kind of like an oil on my ends as you guys know I do have blonde in my hair but I think it's okay right now you'll see like as each day goes by it will start to look more dry so I think the only thing I'm gonna put in it right now is called frizz ease by John Frieda it's a secret weapon touch-up cream I love this a lot so it's a calm and smooth frizzy prone hair so I will put this technically like everywhere I know you're not really supposed to put powder at your root but because it's just too crazy I will focus up at the top and like kind of straighten out these little pieces I don't want to get rid of the volume that I have at the top I just kind of want to contain everything so as you can see it already did quite a lot and then like I used yesterday I have this one by living proof it's a styling cream if I feel like this part isn't looking as nice I will take just a little bit of this but I'll kind of just like use it to like crunch my hair this is what the back kind of looks like with the products this is what I will do for day one I'll go all of day one with it just like this leaving it like that um yeah it might be a little crazy but I like it rock rock your natural hair girl you look beautiful so that is all for today hello alright it is actually day three so yesterday was day two I did end up filming that Alethea woke up throwing up and then yesterday I didn't really do my hair or anything I did the same steps that I did on day one but now it is day three I have it up right now but you can see like my baby hairs are all over the place I'm gonna take it down just so you can see but as the days go on the curls start to like lose their prettiness it starts to get greasy so this for me is like what I really struggle with when I do my hair curly because of this like you can't really like correct it or fix it so I thought I'd share a couple of tips with you guys it's like what I do as days go on and one key thing that I think is like changed my hair game and that is when I go to shower I put on a shower cap and I put on like a little spa thing to kind of preserve my crazy baby hairs and let me grab it real quick okay so as you know every day when you go to shower I mean I shower every day even though I'm not washing my hair so like I'll get into the shower you can watch my body but I'm not watching my hair I just I don't know I'm always does everyone else do that I'm assuming so I hope so I know just days I really need to make sure my hair does not get wet because when it gets wet it gets crazy all over again and gets all frizzy and all of that so I thought I'd show you what I do at night because this is what I think helps preserve my hair and keep it longer and more gigs my goal is to go 5 days without washing it when it's curly or on day 3 and it's honestly not even looking at Gracie's what I'll do before I get into showers I'll put it up in a ponytail just or even kind of like a bun like that just so it's like up and I take this guy this guy is like those things if they use when you get facials the reason why I use this is because if you just put this on your head your baby hairs and like all of this is still exposed and to me this is what needs to like not get frizzy because it's already frizzy so I put this on black this so boom there's nothing exposed and then when I go to wash my face I'm just careful about getting in my hair and then I put this guy plop it over I know it's a very cute look it looks really nice definitely gonna go burp you're having like this but literally this is what it saves me in the Malaysia every time I take a bath with her I'll do this to any time I didn't go shower with lazy eye I do this to she she always look at me very funny and like confusing like want to touch this but this guy's has seriously saved me a lot so keep that all in mind as we go in between days this is what I'm doing to preserve my hair for dry shampoo and use this one by batise the teeth and it has a little bit of tint to it so it was a little bit dark one of my biggest pet peeves is when you do dry shampoo and then your hairs light no thank you so I love this because it doesn't do that so my hair stylist actually taught me when you do dry shampoo to do it and then leave it for a little bit so I'm gonna do that for me like this is where I tend to get more greasy is like I'm at the root okay oh oh I do not like inhaling that oh that's the only downside to dry shampoo is like all right so I'm gonna let that sit for a little bit   okay it's been sitting in for a little bit now I'm just gonna kind of massage that into my hair so it's not just like sitting in there and actually like absorbs up the oils honestly it's not too frizzy today I am going to put just a hair of the frizzies in it just just to be safe okay couple different options I really liked in half-up half-down I also really liked wearing hats but I didn't really think a hat matched my outfit you could also do a beanie but beanies I mean look kind of crazy so normally I'll just take like a decent chunk of my hair all the way around through the back I don't always make it a straight line because they feel like it looks like you have more hair when it's kind of just more messy and my hair ties my gimme beauty I love their hair ties okay then you can do a little judge and then you can kind of play around with it what I really liked to do when I do this hairstyle is find my part and pull it apart like this so you can still see it through this hair I don't know why but I feel like it just adds a little bit of some kale so that is what day 3 is gonna look like so I'll keep this in basically all day long at night I'll shower do that same thing this little combo let's not forget about it and then I'll see you guys tomorrow and we'll see what we'll do probably gonna wear a hat but we'll see   okay good morning it next day my hair is only getting crazier I'm gonna pop in my jewelry you look weak cuz I feel naked without my jewelry but for me as the days go with like it being curly what ends up happening is that obviously it gets crazier but they like my curls start to lose their curl or like wave like it starts to flatten itself out and I have a really bad colic in the back of my head I'll show you guys in a second but um I that what it's called colic I think it's like when you know I was hanging like when your hair like naturally wants to go one way but like that's not the way it's supposed to go my hair does that this is what it's starting to look like so it's starting to loosen itself out but I wanted to show you guys the back of my head so I don't know if you can see right there but this piece like will stick up can you see that and then this will just like lay flat so it's just like not a good look and like look at that it just like doesn't know what to do I'm gonna wear hat today this one right here no I'm only depending on like what the ends are looking like I won't do anything to it but today because I do have like quite a lot of jewelry and a lot of stuff going on I'm gonna put it in a low pony or a low bun seeing with these low buttons is you really just have to play around with it like there's no correct way to do it okay I think honestly that's as good as it's gonna get and then we pop our hat on and boom and if your hair ends up looking too greasy obviously and worse you put to it just like play around with it I'm just trying to see how long you can get it to go or without you having to wash it again because it's so much better not to watch it here than it is to wash so I'll see you guys tomorrow good morning last day here guys my hair is hanging on by a thread she is she has seen better days so this is a current situation hi my baby hairs are going crazy it's like starting to get super knotted and tangled I don't really have any curls left like a they're mainly like waves now and it was my outfit today I kind of wanted my hair up since since I'm working on yesterday and it was kind of with the hat I mean I could wear a hat again today but I want to show you guys like different actions so today I'm gonna wear it up in a ponytail because my hair is finally getting long enough for like it looks cute because for a while I had this short hair and that didn't really work so I am gonna put some product in it look at that it's just like it's like starting to get stiff so love that I'm gonna put a little I shampoo at my root so my roots don't look greasy then I'm gonna put a little oil on it just to like a tree height because with the blonde in my hair I've noticed like asthma hair gets dirtier it will start to look more drag so kind I just want to rehydrate that and I'm kind of gonna brush my hair with my fingers throughout all of these days I have not once brushed my hair that is like a big fat no no for me and my hair is we do not brush her all right so I'm just gonna start pulling the hair up and then I'm gonna do that part in the middle again that's the part where it's gonna that we're gonna make it like look pretty so I'm gonna push it around play with it a little bit   I did a lot of playing around with it I don't even know it looks good feel like from far away it does it's just like a very voluminous ponytail and I'm trying my best to like maintain a little baby hairs around my face I'm using the Gimme Beauty I'm here ties and love those so just judging this up making it kind of messy like I don't want it to like look perfect I do like that messy look that is going to be it for this video so hope you guys enjoy it I hope that you're able to get like a couple of like little tips here and there like how to get the longevity out of your hair how to style it how to like work with the dirty hair I have a lot of fun at filming this it's definitely taking me a minute to realize like what really works and doesn't work for my hair hope you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up if you guys want more hair stuff or any more tips like this and the same style I love you guys so much and I will see you my next video bye you are we got one okay hey guys and welcome to my channel a few our new here are welcome back if you've been here before thank you guys so much for watching today's videos so the timing of this video feel like it's a perfect I've been wanting to film this for a couple of weeks now but now I was like wait I need to do this now because at least in Michigan they have closed schools down they have asked people to stay home Alethea swimming classes got canceled Alethea story time got canceled like all of these activities at La Theatre normally does every week has gotten canceled and we're basically staying home all day long I normally stay home all day long anyway but most of the time aleisea comes and goes with the grandmas and she like will go out line working she thrives on going outside she thrives on social interaction she like loves being outdoors she's like very much so like her father's so this time is a little difficult for us I think it's difficult for a lot of us because we're having to stay inside and so what do we do with our babies like it can be very scary because we don't want to just shove them in front of the TV all day long and just like we run out of things to do with them so I really hope that this video is helpful to you guys I'm gonna put a time stamp this videos gonna be packed and full of information so in case you're looking for only one specific thing I'll time stamp so you can easily find it and you don't have to watch like the whole 30 minutes or however long this video ends up being but I do want it to be as informative and helpful to you guys as possible and I do not want you to think that you need to buy anything to do this I don't want you to think that you have to have a playroom to do this I don't want you to think that you have to have this extravagant set up because you really do not I'm gonna go through a list of six things that I think are really necessary and kind of like some six steps that you guys can start implementing today they kind of allow this to happen feel like you need to spend all this money a lot of these things and a lot of these toys you can DIY you can do them at home you can make them with recycled things that you probably already have at your house so if you guys like this style of video if you guys would like a playroom tour or a full DIY video of how I make her toys let me know by giving this video a thumbs up and I will do that for you guys but make sure to subscribe before you leave I make content like this all the time I make fashion videos as well faith videos all types of videos and my husband and I actually have a podcast together and two episodes ago we actually did an entire podcast talking about helping your children with your emotions and kind of helping them with coping and how to realize what their emotions are and a lot of what I do with her plane has to do with for figuring out promotions so if you guys want something more in depth and more like scientific if you will like more fancy more in depth of how helpful these toys are I will leave that podcast episode down below for you guys but let's go ahead and get started okay so like I said I'm gonna go through kind of like a list of things that I think are really important to kind of start especially during this time of quarantine because I know it's gonna be so easy for us to just want to turn on the TV but I can't recommend enough for you guys to limit that as much as possible it is not recommended for children under the age of two to watch any TV at all not even a minute of it but like let's be real like Olivia has watched TV like Jordan I were sick two weeks ago or something and she was watching TV all day long I'm not gonna sit here and pretend that she doesn't watch TV because she definitely does but I try my best to limit it I try not to make it daily I try not to make it a part of our routine the biggest reason for that is because of the habit of it they just get into the habit of watching it TV all the time they're gonna get into the habit of just wanting to sit and be entertained instead of learning how to entertain themselves and learn how to use their imagination use the creativity use the toys to like get things rolling really important to implement those steps really early on so they develop those healthy habits and they develop that creativity and imagining so that as they get older they already have that as like a main thing and then we can start adding and introducing more TV and movies and all that it's not that it's bad it's just it's a really bad habit to start at a young age so I highly suggest avoiding it as much as possible with that off the list my second tip for you guys is to have all of your baby's toys accessible to them at all times so the biggest thing that I get this from is from - Orissa - Ori is one of the methods that I follow for ilithyia's playing I don't follow it like super-sick League but I really do like the whole open shelving system so in our play room I have an open shelving and I display six toys at a time and so she is able to come up here in her playroom she's able to see the toys that she has available to her and she's able to pick and choose which one she wants the reason this is so good is one because it gives them autonomy so they're able to pick and select what they like that makes them feel good that gives them a self-esteem that makes them feel like oh like I get to do something because a lot of a baby's day is dictated by what we want them to do so they never feel like they're in control of anything so allowing them to pick out their toys is so helpful to them and their autonomy and their self-esteem and their controls so that is a very small simple way but they're able to pick out their own toys once they're able to pick out their own toys they can bring them down they can play with it they can put it back it may sound very simple but it helps them a lot that way they're not having to go mommy mommy amethyst why I want that toy or they're not able to just simply go and entertain themselves what they want so we have a playroom and like I said you do not need a playroom before you moved into this house we didn't have a playroom I actually had this whole setup in my kitchen basically you just need some shelving not even shelving if you want you can display like three to four toys and just put them on the ground for your baby to pick and select from most of the time but she actually ends up playing downstairs in her kitchen have two baskets one with some toys and then one with some books and then a couple of other activities that she can pick and choose from but if we're not upstairs and if I'm downstairs cooking dinner or if I'm doing something else or if I'm doing the dishes but I can't be upstairs in the playroom I always have her down there and she prefers that so there's different ways you guys can do this obviously whatever works for your family but you can set it up in your kitchen your living room your playroom wherever it is best and easiest for you so as long as your baby can see and reach your toys you are golden kind of an addition to it being somewhere where they can easily reach make sure it's a safe place as well make sure it's a baby proof area make sure that you have a peace of mind knowing if your baby is over there playing they're not gonna hurt themselves so I've made sure that everything around her is safe everything like there's nothing that she can pull down on that could fall on her and just make sure it's a safe spot for your baby to be playing and if it isn't in like in a designated area also suggest using a rug or like a play rug so I don't know if you guys can see but there's like a fuzzy rug over there and back in our old house what I'd have her do is play on that rug so she knew like that was her designated space so she knew that was her place that's where she played and she kept all of her toys can find it in that space so I definitely suggest that to just for them to mentally know like this is my space like this is where I have my toys it just helps them a lot with that as well and helps them keep everything focused okay number three is the kind of toys that you use so as you guys know if you follow me on Instagram you know I'm very picky about the toys that she plays with but that is for such good reason guys when I went to school my major was early childhood education so I like learned all about this stuff I didn't graduate that's fine though but I did learn so much and a lot of what I do with Alethea I learned in schools so toys are so important because to a child they learn through play that's it as simple as that children learn through play so it's very important that the toys that they're playing with are going to be helping them further helping them develop those neurons helping them put the pieces together to learn my rule of thumb is if it needs batteries it's not gonna be in my house we don't have any toys that have batteries and I say that because I don't there are toys that she has that aren't wooden toys because a lot of people think her toys are all wooden they're not I do have a large majority majority of them are wooden but there's a lot of them that aren't as well so a lot of these toys can also be di wide so you don't have to go and throw out all your toys that's not what I'm saying to do here you can create new toys and you can kind of think of different ways to utilize the toys that you currently have or you can DIY them or you can just moving forward implement this my biggest but I why I already said one of the rules um but the biggest one is if it has batteries we don't buy it number two it needs to have a task and what I mean by that is it needs to have the child doing something or accomplishing something again this is gonna help with their self-esteem this is gonna help with their autonomy this is gonna help them figure out fine motor skills this is gonna help them figure out roast motor skills it's gonna help them figure out so many things when the toy has an activity or a task for them to do it keeps them entertained for much longer because they're able to do that task and then they want to do it again and they want to do it again and they want to do it again if they're just sitting there and touching the toy that's just making now noises and sounds and spitting colors out then they're gonna do that for a little bit but then they're gonna get tired of it because it's not gonna it's not gonna fulfill them it's not gonna make them do anything but if there's a task that needs to be done they're gonna do that task they're gonna feel so good it's gonna help their self their self-esteem so much they're gonna get excited and they're gonna do it again and again and again so there's a lot more behind just like them playing like I mentioned in our podcast episode like it really does help with their emotional health and emotional this if they're doing something and they're getting frustrated they're able to overcome that and you can help them they can help each other like they're able to overcome the frustration of not getting a task but once they do they get so happy it's a really good healthy habit and a good healthy thing for your child to develop a lot of these can also be DIY I will link some DIY accounts that I follow on Instagram as well as Pinterest I love Pinterest guys I get so many good ideas like I said you do not need to spend money on new toys you do not need to go out and get all these things you can make them at home you can DIY them so I will leave those links and resources down below for you guys if you'd like to do that and I really hope it helps because for me idea about a lot of her toys as well another great tool our books do not underestimate the love of books Alethea has loved her books I tried my best to read to her as much as I could starting at a very young age again starting those really healthy habits at a really young age so she always likes him she always gravitates towards her books her books are always always accessible to her so her books are actually down right in this thing and then downstairs they're in one of the bins but I allow her toys and her books and her puzzles all to be accessible to her at all times and I've just found that she loves to read her books by herself obviously she can't read but she's going through the pages she like knows how to do it she'll point at things it's just very helpful to use books to them and again these are healthy habits don't expect your child to like love a book overnight it's definitely a just definitely give them that grace definitely have the patience there is a period where a lengthy I did not like books she would open it for five seconds and then crawl away so be patient because these are babies we can't expect them to read a book for 45 minutes like we have to be realistic here think of small increments like 30 seconds a minute two minutes like that is great and celebrate the small milestones because the small milestones will gradually become really big milestones so be patient with them and be patient with yourself too so they may not love books but I promise you if you get into that rhythm into that routine that they will end up loving them and books are so good guys okay tip number four and this is the most helpful one I think every mama needs to start doing today I want you to start doing this today I cannot encourage this enough and that is to rotate your toys now you don't need to have a million toys you don't need to have a huge storage room you don't need to have all these extravagant big things of stuff to do if you have ten toys divide it into two five one week another five the other week flip them around do another five do another five you don't need a bunch of toys the reason why rotating their toys is such a good exercise to do it's because if you throw all 500 twice at them at once they're gonna get tired of all those 500 toys at the exact same time and then what are you gonna do go buy another 500 toys no this is such a smart way to utilize all the toys that you but constantly keep your baby entertained and they don't get bored of playing with the same toy over and over again so like I said with the shelving system that we have that's over here six toys are displayed so each week I pick out six toys for her to play with at the end of the week every Sunday I rotate them and put another six toys or I'll change the way a toy is meant to be played with or I'll add something to a toy to spike her interest to get her to get her excited about it and boom I'm saving myself so much time so much money I'm not having to buy tons of toys cuz I'm just rotating them it's new and exciting to her cuz she hasn't seen it in a couple of weeks but realistically she played with that toy two weeks ago but she won't remember that so I just cannot encourage it enough for you guys to just try that you can also rotate your books this is the thing I always do for her as well and I actually rotate the entire playroom like with all the toys and activities that I have around here so again give this video a thumbs up if you guys would like a full tour of that and kind of me explaining why I rotate through what stays but doesn't end up staying if you want more details on that but guys rotate the books this is especially helpful during Christmas and birthdays because for Christmas Alexia is the first grandbaby everyone wanted to give her everything in the entire world and I was like okay that's fine that's great but I'm not gonna introduce those toys to her all at once so what I did is I took all the gifts that she got for Christmas I put them all in the closet and I took out one by one each week she still has tons of toys from Christmas that she hasn't even touched or seen yet because I haven't even rotated them through I slowly add one new one to the pile of toys we already have and she'll get to play with that but I'm getting the longevity out of these toys for like a year even though we got them back in Christmas so guys definitely recommend rotations number five and this is one that has made my life so much better guys and that is for your child to learn how to sell entertain now this self entertaining alone time independent play whatever you whatever fancy word you want to use is so-so crucial to a child's learning and to your learning and to just life because as a mom you cannot sit and entertain your baby 24/7 if you can perhaps to you because I cannot like I literally do not have the patience to read a book 15 times over and over again like I reach a limit you know and I also have things to do you know like especially since I've been pregnant like I've been really trying to implement this in her routine and really trying to push her to get to that because I just know with a new baby coming I will not be able to devote 100% of my time to her so independent play is just so important this will be very easy to do if you guys follow the steps from above because you're giving them the tools and resources and knowledge that they need to be able to do this on their own so if you've never done this before I suggest you start small because you can't expect a child who's never played by themselves to play for 30 minutes alone you definitely have to start small and I'm talking 30 30 seconds to a minute to two minutes at a time so for Alethea I put her in her safe space which is her playroom or if you have it somewhere else wherever that space is you can start by playing with them so normally that's what I will do I will bring down a toy with her I'll get her engaged in it get her playing with it and then I'll stop and let her know hey mama is gonna go get dressed for 15 minutes I will be in my room Alethea is gonna stay here playing with her toys I will be right back once those 15 minutes are over okay I want you to explore these I want you to play with these toys and then I will go and she'll stay now sometimes she'll stay and she'll stay for like 30 minutes other times like a couple days ago I had to put her back into the playroom five different times because she just didn't want to play by herself and she wanted to be with me which is fine that's okay work in small increments have them play by themselves for a minute and then come back and reward them give them that positive reinforcement of like yes you did it you're able to play and then you can push that further and further and you'll be able to get them to play by themselves by 30 minutes in the month or something so definitely encourage them don't get frustrated with them don't get frustrated with yourself definitely you a lot of Grace and just a lot of love during that because it is a very hard task and we talk about babies here you know like I sometimes have a hard time sitting still by myself and playing for 30 minutes we can't expect that much out of them so given that peace and give them that love as well number six is to let them explore now for me this is something that was kind of hard for me to do because I spent a lot of time organizing my pantry I spent a lot of time organizing my Tupperware but I have found that girlfriend loves everything that's not a toy she loves the Tupperware she loves the pots and pans she loves the spoons she loves playing with things that like art toys but that is so good for them to play with so if you find that your child doesn't want to play with their toys let them play in the cupboards let them watch you cook we recently got a learning tower for Alethea which is another thing that Montessori does and it allows her to be up on the countertop every time I go to cook dinner I've noticed that she just wants to be held and wants to interact and like see what I'm doing was just totally fine so but because I'm pregnant and like cooking with one hand and cracking an egg like it's hard to do so having this tower has made it so much easier for me and her because she's able to see what I'm doing I'm having her help me she's seeing what I'm doing I don't have to like worry about her getting into something that she's not supposed to be getting into like overall it just has helped so much so again if there's a birthday coming up ask the grandparents ask your friends her birthdays and holidays and stuff I always make a little Amazon wishlist for her and I send it to our family and I don't think that's like wrong to do I'll put things that range anywhere between $5 to $100 to like make sure everyone's price range is accommodated for but at the same time then I know that she'll be getting stuff that she really liked and utilize as well my mom actually got her that learning tower for her birthday she's loved it and utilized it so much so just think outside of the box and let them explore let them play with certain things that you wouldn't really expect them to be playing with because at the end of the day they're using their imagination they're using their creativity and they're able to do that so much easier and last thing I'll touch on is to have this all prepared I've noticed the days that I don't rate to rotate her toys or the days that I don't have these things set and ready for her the days that I don't really have anything planned for the day are the days that go back really slow and are really hard so in addition to doing all these toy things I'm going to walk with them Alethea is now starting to walk so instead of putting her in the stroller we're holding her hand and having her physically walk you guys can still go to parks if they're not too crowded walk the dogs with her or do some type of physical activity do dance time what I'll do once a day is play music for like 10 to 15 minutes and we'll just dance I'll try to get her to move around you guys I've seen her dance moves like she loves it so dance play around I have this thing right here that she loves to climb up and down you know utilize the stairs make them run up and down the stairs there's so many things that we can do during the day and of course I'm gonna link resources down below that have been giving really good ideas of how to just keep them entertained keep them busy keep them flowing so the more prepares you are for the day the more happy your baby will be and don't wait until they're throwing a tantrum and screaming all over the place to entertain them let's try to avoid and go back a couple of steps before they get to that frustrated and boredom part so be prepared mamas I'm excited for you guys I'll let me know if you guys have any questions down below I really hope this video is helpful to you guys again let me know questions I'm gonna be monitoring I'm always answering comments but let me know also make sure to follow me on Instagram because I'm constantly posting DIY stuff that I'm making for her things that I'm trying out new toys and all of that so I'll leave my Instagram right here for you guys but I love you guys so much have some grace with your babies have some grace for yourselves you guys can do it let me know any ideas you guys have down below for DIY toys I love you so much and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys it good morning welcome to my channel or welcome back today we are going to be getting ready for absolutely no reason yay I love that yes so in light of everything that is going on and everyone being in quarantine which to be honest my life is always like being quarantined because I work from home and I'm a home bad like I honestly do not leave my house all that much anyway so honestly for me this is something that I do every day but I thought I would do this video for those of you who aren't going to work or having to work from home I think getting ready it definitely changes your entire day and if you want to have a productive day and if you want to like feels like your day is like what it normally is I definitely think getting ready is essential even though we're not going anywhere for me when I have my makeup done I have a cute outfit on I just feel so much more productive and I feel like I get so much more done as opposed to if I stay in my pajamas all day I'm more likely to work in my bed I'm more likely to not get as much done I just feel more sluggish and slug slouching throughout the day so for me getting dressed whether I'm leaving the house or not as essential so I thought I would do this video with you guys and updated makeup routine updated makeup video but kind of fun and playful because I know there's so much going on right now and I really don't want to keep talking about it because I know we are hearing a lot from the media I know it's all over social media and I kind of want you guys to be able to come to my channel and escape that I hope you guys enjoy this video I'm gonna link everything that I use it down below in case you guys are curious about it a lot of this stuff is very affordable I do try my best to use more drugstore stuff so I'm gonna walk you guys through my entire routine through the entire process my camera if you guys notice I put my new lens on so you guys get to see like super high depth of all my pores and imperfections my moustache yep she's there embrace her it's fine I love her so let's um get started get ready together if you're getting ready for the day put this video on and let's get ready together or watch it tomorrow morning we can get ready together and like you know drink our coffee and pretend like we're getting ready together to do nothing it's my first thing I do is I prep my skin I love to use a vitamin C serum or vitamin C something I used this one right here I don't remember where I got it from but I like it a lot and as you guys can tell my face is SuperDuper cool and that is because I do self tan and I don't self tan my face the reason for that is because I feel like it's not necessary because most the time I'm going to put makeup on anyway and I'm afraid that my face will have like your reaction to it or I'm pretty sure they don't even recommend you put it on your face so I will have to match my skin and don't worry like I won't look like this okay the next product I use is by elf this one right here it's a poreless putty primer I fell in love with this through tik-tok if you guys are on tik-tok you know that it's like a trendy thing for like different drugstores dupes and products are on there so I saw this on one of the tick-tocks many many times so it's like okay I made it try this so I just focus it in this area right here because it's aware my pores are a little bit larger and I like under my eyes just like in this area right here next thing that I use for my foundation is this one right here by L'Oreal it is the infallible 24-hour fresh wear which is another one that I found and pink talked that I saw so many people raving about and I really really really like this I think it's so pretty it is full coverage but it just like doesn't feel full coverage and sometimes I will mix it with this matte and poreless one as well when my tan starts to fade a little bit and this is a little bit lighter I'll mix these two together or if I'm having a day where I don't want full coverage I don't want to look like I'm wearing makeup I will wear this bare whoa I will wear this bareMinerals I want to write here complexion a rescue it's attempted hydrating creams so I have everything that I use right here in my makeup I recently organized all of my under cabinet everything I'll link that video down below for you guys if you find more time on your hands right now and you want to declutter and clean a link that video down below hopefully ou inspire you guys and like getting you excited to clean but I will normally do like two to three pumps of this on the back of my hand and apply it like this and let me just say doing this video right now is so relaxing to me because normally when I get ready I'm rushing and I have aleisea on my hip or I'm trying to hand her products that I'm using and like give it to her normally she does independent play when I get ready but recently she hasn't she's been just like wanting to chill with me and watch me do my makeup which is fine but then I don't really get to like enjoy that so I'm enjoying the peace and quiet right now that I get yesterday there was right okay I just pulled my hair back just because it can get a little distracting so next thing is that I will use is my concealer I've recently switched over to the NARS at creamy concealer I really like it it's just like a super light weight I was using the Tarte shaped heat before but it's a little bit too heavy sometimes and I just want more of like a light and airy look so I'm gonna apply that all up blend it out now I'm not gonna set that just yet because I do use a cream bronzer so I actually used this one right here it's actually a foundation but I've had this Foundation it's a little bit too dark for me right now and instead of me throwing out I just use it as a bronzer so it is Make Up For Ever foundation but because it's like in the stick form it's so easy to just use it as a bronzer so I normally will just apply this on the outside a little bit on my nose and a little bit under my eyes like that and then I use this Sigma brush to blend it all out it's just like a stippling brush I love using cream bronzer because I feel like it helps keep my skin really hydrated and looking more glowy and more dewy especially during the winter months it's still pretty cold here so my skin is really dry and I just love this hack and it just melts into your skin a lot better too so I just think it looks really pretty on camera it looks really pretty in person um I just don't really like powders I'm not big into powders I try to use liquid for a lot of my stuff and then next thing I will do is put blush and this one is cream as well this is NARS love NARS its NARS orgasm but in a blush form this is so pigmented like I literally have to shake everything out because it's just really really pigmented I will just do one little thing on my cheek a little bit on my nose because I feel like it makes it just makes everything look you fight and then I have to do it with the sponge because if you do it with the brush it's just way too dark so I need the the sponge to like absorb a majority of it so only powder I am gonna apply right now is my highlighter which is this one right here by Laura Geller and gilded honey and I'm just going to just gently like ever so gently like I don't really like that like full look I kind of just like it more airbrushed over my cheek so I like having a brush like this that kind of moves with it because I just kind of like it all over my cheek not just like in one like straight line you know like I want my whole face to really look highlighted so I kind of just blend it all over the teeth next up we're just moving on to eyes I like to keep my eyes super simple I have this palette right here by dose of colors it's called baked brown and it's so stinking pretty I just pick up this shade right here with a fluffy brush and just ever so slightly work that into my crease I kind of start on the outside like this work in circular motions and then I bring it up to the front and do the front part right here and then back this just like gives some color to my eye because I don't like something too dark and then I will do my eyebrows and I use the NYX micro brow pencil to fill them in okay so let's chat for a little bit and let's not talk about Corona let's talk about something more lighthearted and fun so I'm currently working on a seven day devotional that I want to release you guys within the next couple of weeks it will be totally free I've had on my heart to do this for so long and then with this whole thing happening I was like this is a perfect time to do it because I know people are bored they don't have something to do like they're I feel like a lot of people are turning to their faith right now which i think is so amazing and so like such a glorious thing to see because I mean during times like this it really makes you re-evaluate and really makes you stop for a minute and realize what is actually important so like I feel it because everyone has also these distractions taken away we are really just turning our heads up to the Lord which makes me so happy so I'm currently working on that I'm trying my best to get it up as soon as possible but that is just a little spoil a little I'll spoil alert if you will but I'm really excited I'm going to make it a PDF so you guys will be able to download it and then you can print it off and like physically write in it because I was gonna do it all online but then I was like I personally like to write draw do stuff and I feel like if you're doing it on your phones you might be more likely to get distracted might go on Instagram real quick and then forget to do it so I feel like doing a PDF that is printable for you guys where you can just print it out have it physically in front of you physically write on it I feel like will be really beneficial to be on the lookout for that I'm working it very hard to get that done I've been having lots of late nights lots of early mornings to just try to figure that out on top of like doing YouTube and Instagram and being a mama and all of that but I'm so so stinking excited about it but on top of that I'm also like brainstorming I wanted to really do a video on some good habits to build because I feel like a lot of people are at home right now and working from home is not easy and I think a lot of people don't realize how easy it is to build really bad habits so I thought it would be a tenley video to just talk about some really good habits I've been trying my best every morning to do stretches I've been reading my Bible before Alethea wakes up I've been trying to like do little things that have completely changed what my day ends up looking like so I thought I would do a video on that as well but let me know what it is that you guys want to see I've been trying to do like a range of stuff like I did some fashion videos I did mommy videos doing a makeup video I'm going to do it video like let me know what it is more that you guys would like to see from me during this time because I am just uploading a lot more frequently you guys have probably noticed I've been uploading about three times a week which I'm very proud of because three videos in a week is honestly all it is a lot but I've been having so much fun with it so this week I am not uploading three times so because I'm trying to devote my extra time it to the devotional to get that out as soon as possible but yeah I hope you guys have noticed and enjoyed that so as you guys just saw I curl my eyelashes this is key for me to curl them right before and now we're going to take my mascara and i use the l'oreal lash paradise I'm still using this I will always use this mascara it is so stinking good and I love it so much yes dude okay that is what it looks like I'm actually gonna let it dry for a little bit while it dries I'm gonna do my lips and then I actually do curl my eyelashes again I know so people say like to do that I haven't had a problem with it you just have to make sure that they're fully dry so you're not like ripping and pulling them off so before my list I'm gonna use this one by L'Oreal it's in the shade and power it's like a I don't know how to describe it it's like a liquid lipstick but it's not too matte I just really like the color I think it's really pretty and as you guys notice I did put foundation on my lips cuz all right just like canceling out the color I'm gonna bring my hair down I'm actually gonna grab a hat cuz my hair is so stinking greasy oh you guys should definitely take advantage of this whole quarantine thing and try to train your hair to get yourself to not have to wash it as much so when you are training your hair you basically can train your hair to not have to watch it so much because the more you wash it the more oils do produce so the less you wash it the less you have to wash it um for me I did this about two years ago I basically go a couple of days extra than normal to not wash my hair so since you guys are gonna have to be at home anyway try to go as long as you can without washing your hair to get it to train so you don't have to wash it as much I'm gonna grab my hat I'll be right back and I'll finish that today's video alright hat is on last thing I'm going to do is a curl my eyelashes again so they are completely dry and I just gently go in Andrey curl them I have found that this makes the biggest difference because it really just like gives them that extra like oomph you can already tell from each eye all right guys and this is the completed look so I am just a little bit closer just so you guys can see how light and airy it is I don't have any like filters on my camera or anything like that this is the real deal my real pores and all of that but I really hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm praying for you guys and I hope you guys all stay safe you guys are in my prayers everyday I love you guys so much make sure to give this video a thumbs up if you want more makeup videos and more chatty videos like this and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys I'll welcome it to my channel if you are new here and welcome back if you've been here many times before today I'm going to be doing a first and second trimester recap taking me a minute to do this because I just feel like I keep forgetting that I'm pregnant I'm like it's like everyone keeps forgetting about that today I'm very excited I'm gonna timestamp this video because I want to be as informative as possible and help any of the amount mothers at our first time mamas I'm gonna go through every single little detail from the sex in the intimacy from like how I've been doing how it's been being pregnant for the second time like how it's been having a baby so close to another baby all the detail all the tea all the juice that you guys want to hear I will be addressing in today's video so make sure to give this video a thumbs up and if you want more baby related videos definitely comment that down below let me know what it is that you want to see I will be doing a names we like but won't be using video very soon so be on the lookout for that I know a lot of you guys have requested that make sure to subscribe before you leave because this baby is coming very soon and let's go ahead and get right into it let's kick into it alright so first things first I am 27 weeks and 3 days my due date is June 19th and I'm having a baby boy if you guys know me I have a girl and she's 13 months she became 13 months just a couple of days ago so I am having to under too they are very close together they will be 16 months apart so that is really close and I will say with this pregnancy one of my like must have so far has been the bump app because I use that a lie it's my favorite pregnancy app I used it with my first pregnancy I'm using it again and it has truly saved me because I feel like I keep forgetting how many weeks I am and this pregnancy is honestly flying by the beginning went really slow but now it's picking up pretty fast I'm pretty sure I'm in the third trimester or maybe at 28 I can't remember but I'm pretty far along so I'm gonna start off with showing guys my belly so my belly does look very similar to how my belly did when I was pregnant with ilithyia Carrie naturally very low and yeah I just my belly button looks really different this time and I'm not sure why but my belly button like looks like it's gonna fall out with my belly button was like yeah I got an Audi like a super duper outie ow d though and this is my little outfit of the day and this is what my belly looks like so and this is what 27 weeks looks on me I have noticed that my belly is still like the same as when it was little I feel like I don't feel like my tummy is much larger because it's my second baby I did show a lot sooner this time around like I showed really early I started showing you around like 11 weeks and then after that I feel like I was the same size until I was like honestly 20 weeks and then after that it's been like the same growth so pretty big I feel like it's pretty big I'm definitely feeling super pregnant now yeah this is what my belly looks like so like I said my belly button is kind of like sticking down I currently don't have a new stretch marks I did get stretch marks with Alethea it's like three days before I gave birth I got stretch marks right here and they naturally did go away when I was breastfeeding I would apply breast milk onto my stretch marks and they went away and so far I feel like they haven't come back and if it does appears it's not that big of a deal but I have been using this right here for my stretch marks it's by a company called now it's just shea butter it's so thick and so creamy that's what the inside looks like and it is amazing so I do lather my tummy up in that but also keep in mind it's a lot of genetics as well and it's not that big of a deal if you get stretch marks honestly I think they're beautiful and it's just a great way to show how you carried your baby so that is what my tummy looks like now when it came to getting pregnant Jordan I did like to have our babies close together and I didn't know how long it would take for me to get pregnant because when I got pregnant with ilithyia it was a surprise so I wasn't sure like how long you take my body I feel like it's like a game that you don't really know so we started trying when she was seven months old now keep in mind I was still breastfeeding and they say that with breastfeeding it like takes you longer to get pregnant cuz it's like a natural form of birth control yada yada yeah I don't know they say they say it's not as easy to get pregnant when you're breastfeeding but they lied because I got pregnant on the first try so even though I wanted them close together I did not expect it was a big surprise like we were very shocked to find out that I had gotten pregnant so easily so your girl is fertile I'm very thankful for that obviously like I do not take that for granted at all because I know so many women struggle with infertility and my heart hurts for me because I can't imagine how difficult that must be but that wasn't the case for us so she was seven months old when I ended up getting pregnant and I didn't know I was pregnant when we did find out I was six weeks I'll link that video up here because it's very funny because we are just genuinely so shocked that it's just a very funny reaction we found out on camera I'm so happy I pulled out the camera because we weren't expecting anything but I'm very glad that I did and I was able to get a reaction of finding out but um I even saying oh I didn't feel like I was pregnant I was six weeks when we found out the only thing that I had felt was I was so Moody I was so crabby I was so snappy and then Jordan was like oh that makes so much sense and then around 7 to 8 weeks is when I started to feel pregnant and let me tell you it hit me like a pound of bricks like I really really really struggle with my first trimester I did with Leigh Thea and I did with this one I get very nauseous I end up in the hospital multiple times I did with lakeya I did with this one I don't I was diagnosed with hyper Damita sore however you cannot sit with Alethea this one I wasn't but I was nauseous all the time throwing up I would have to go to the ER all the time and it was so much more difficult this time because I had a seven month old baby it was a lot more difficult because I couldn't just snap whenever I wanted to I couldn't just like go and throw up and if I wanted to like if I was throwing up I was throwing up with her on my lap on my hip and having to like entertain her and take care of her so it was very difficult but again I kind of wish that upon myself I'm not complaining about it because I knew the possibilities of that so I will just say it is a lot more difficult because you have another child to take care of so the only thing that was able to help me with my nausea was unisom and let me tell you this is great so it's actually a sleeping pill so you're supposed to take it at night and then it obviously makes you sleep and then when you wake up it's supposed to help with the morning sickness and the nausea the only thing is that I had morning sickness and all-day sickness there would be some day so to be throwing up at night some days in the middle of the day sometimes just in the morning like I just overall had sickness so this really did help other than that I have not found anything that helps I tried to eat as much as I could but during this time you don't really want to eat you're really picky like all you can really think about is like how something is gonna taste when you throw it up it's like you don't really want to eat anything so my biggest advice is just eat what you can this is what my doctor told me drink what you can drink coke if you want to drink Vernors like something fizzy and it will get better so for me I was nauseous from seven weeks until I was fifteen weeks but then after 15 weeks hit it was great and dandy and I was able to kind of fly by so that's kind of like my first trimester recap is like it was horrible you're very tired you feel super lazy and honestly let your body do its thing it was so hard for me to rest when my body wanted to rest because I had a really hard time in the beginning not identifying my self and who I am in what I was doing and working so I felt like if I slept all day that I was like so lazy and unproductive and that's not true because you're worth does that come from that your worth comes from Christ so for me that was like a huge learning experience and it took me a couple weeks to realize like it's okay let your body rest so I'm letting you know right now do not feel lazy let your body rest you are literally growing a human being like Hello that's a lot of work so let your body do its thing and ask for help I'm so thankful that I have my mom and mother-in-law nearby because they were able to help with the Lai Thea and some days they would take her for like five six hours and I would be able to just sleep all day and it was wonderful it was wonderful like I have no regrets like it your body needs it and do it like if you have the ability to do that do it if you come home from work nap like don't work out I don't do that like don't worry about working out I mean yes obviously if you have the energy to do it do it but if you don't have the energy to do it do not push yourself because it's not worth it so wait until you feel good and feel great I'm just now feeling okay where I feel like I can't work out so that's that as far as supplements go with Olay Thea I took care of vitamins this is them right here it's like individualized packets so you take a quiz and I let them know I was pregnant so this has like a prenatal of fish oil and something else I can't remember what it is but in addition to taking these I also take this other woman take this one right here it's called blood builders so I get anemic when I'm pregnant it's always been an issue with my first one if with this one I got severely anemic as well I actually ended up in the hospital for like three days and had to get two blood transfusions so this is essential for me to keep my iron up it is common for you to become a little anemic when you're pregnant but my body naturally is very anemic and know when I get pregnant it's super anemic so this is just something I need to stay on top of so Blood builder right here has helped me a lot and then I would also take the unisom so that is basically what has gotten me through the entire pregnancy um now moving on to the second trimester so with this pregnancy I'm gonna highlight kind of like what I feel like has been different and what has been the same honestly this pregnancy has been very very similar I asked you guys had Instagram what you wanted to know and like 99% of the questions was is a girl pregnancy different than a boy pregnancy and for me it has not been the case at all my pregnancies have been very similar like I feel like my body just reacts the exact same way to both of them so I haven't noticed like a difference I thought I was having a girl because my pregnancy was so similar for the longest time but then last minute I switched and I was like maybe it's a boy so it has been very similar for me nothing very drastic I do have just three things that I've noticed that have been different but like overall it's been very similar first thing it's my sex drive is like with ilithyia I feel like my hormones were like so happy like all over the place that I was like always wanting to have sex like to be honest like I was thriving of course my husband loved that as well but with this pregnancy it has been so stinking hard because I literally don't want to do anything and I just want to sit in bed and sleep like don't touch me don't look at me for too long cuz like no like that's literally how it has been so it's been an adjustment for Jordan I trying to figure out like our ways around that but that for me has been like the biggest thing I guess it's just the hormones I don't know like I don't know it's annoying because I can't wait for that to be over because I feel bad for Jordan but still like that has been a big thing that I've noticed because with Elysia I was like ready to go and now I'm like water break one thing I've noticed with this pregnancy that I haven't been doing is drinking water so I asked Jordan to get this for me yesterday he found it at Target it's an off-brand of the Yeti I really wanted a Yeti but this was $10 and a yeti is like 40 so mmhmm I like this so much better I've been obsessed with it I literally got it yesterday I feel like I've drank so much water then it's been great so I'll link this down below if you guys are curious about it it's $10 so that's great another thing that has half with this pregnancy is at night after I shower and like lather my body up and like it all great and ready for bed my skin gets so itchy and it's been so bizarre I did some googling yesterday because it has happened the past three nights and apparently it's a thing when you're pregnant I haven't talked to my doctor about it so I'm not gonna say that I've been diagnosed with this thing I don't even remember what it's called but it's like a thing where there's certain hormones that go throughout your body that when you're pregnant like it makes you super itchy and it only happens at night and it's so strange because I literally will be laying in bed and I cannot sit still because I'm just like itching and scratching so if you've dealt with this the only thing that I've noticed that has helped me is one I'm always lotioned up so it's not like my skin is giant cracked because I'm always lathered up so it's like so bizarre but the only thing that helps me fall asleep as I literally rock back and forth like this cuz it kind of distracts me from the itchiness and if you've had this you know like how intense in like annoying that is so I haven't brought it up to my doctor yet but I do have an appointment next week so I'm gonna bring it up and I'll let you guys know but like just sitting there I'm trying not to it's so bizarre it's so bizarre I don't even know what it's called I don't know why it happens but it's like apparently a thing so that has been something I've dealt with another thing that I've dealt with that I did it with my first pregnancy is heartburn and let me tell you heartburn is very annoying like oh you feel it like right here I haven't found anything to do like anything to make it go away I've just noticed that it naturally goes away it'll be like intense for a couple of minutes I kind of do this a little bit and then it goes away I haven't noticed that it's been with like a specific food or like anything in particular that I eat I just noticed that sometimes I'll just get it sometimes I won't I don't know it's kind of like sporadic but I did not have heartburn if Alethea but I am with this one far as second trimester must-haves go I've been super uncomfortable and feeling very pregnant the other day I posted like I just feel large like I know my belly isn't that big but because I'm so low and because I have to carry Alethea around all day and just like overall feel like I'm so big so late these 13 months she's a baby don't we she's not a toddler she is a baby still so I'm still carrying her around she just started walking but most of the times she wants to be on my hip and I know that she knows I'm pregnant so I can tell that she just wants more mama which is fine but I feel like I'm just feeling so much larger because I'm having to carry her around more I'm having just like I don't know I feel like we're got a lot of stuff you know for me with sleeping and this is a must pregnant women must must must is a pregnancy pillow Jordan got this pregnancy pillow for me with Alethea I love it so much it's great I fully wrap myself up with it so I might as well show you because I just love it so much so I have it wear this long part is normally on my back and then I have this in between my legs like that and then this up here and then it's just so comfy and I'll shove like this lower part underneath my belly for like more support but it's great so I normally sleep on my side sometimes I used to sleep on my back you're not really supposed to sleep on your back when you're pregnant but for me with this pregnancy pillow like I love the way I sleep and postpartum I still use this because you still kind of have a belly postpartum so that has been a huge must for me and then this water bottle has been recently added to my must because I feel like it's so important to drink water and take care of yourself I am going to start working out now because I feel like I have a little bit more energy and that's another thing that I've noticed is I don't have like that much energy as I did with lethea because when I was pregnant with her I was able to rest when I wanted to I was able to spend my time doing other things and now with this time I'm either working or taking care of Alethea or doing something making dinner like I feel like I'm always doing something I don't have downtime from the minute I wake up till the minute I go to bed like I don't have downtime I'm always doing something so that has been just more challenging in the aspect of like I don't really get to rest as much but I'm feeling good I'm feeling it great far as weight goes I have not gained much at all maybe I think three pounds because in the beginning I vomited a lie and I've lost a lot of weight because I was anemic like there are so many complications that happen so that that's another reason why people keep forgetting I'm pregnant it's because like I looked the same with aleisea I think I ended up gaining 25 pounds or something like that but again I gained it all towards the very end it's common for me not to gain any weight in the first and second trimester most of that weight gain comes in the third trimester I get very swollen and very bloated and just like hold onto a lot of water weight but again who cares how much weight you gain like I don't look at the scale I don't look at the numbers like I don't get caught up in that because that's just not healthy and you are growing a human being again be healthy like don't overindulge like it's like one thing to like have cravings and like snacks but like don't over indulge I don't use my pregnancy as an excuse to just like eat and pig out I I feel like that's not really healthy to do my doctor did it recommend that I just try to like still be healthy and active and eat well for my baby because of this food that you're eating is literally going to them but at the same time like yes you can still have those yummy chocolate cakes you can still have that popcorn popcorn has been my biggest craving it's so weird I don't know why but like a popcorn and a coke is just so good mmm it's not my message me saying that you can buy popcorn from imagine in like big bags so like yeah I'm gonna go do that I'm gonna do that after I film this video actually because I really want power for now eat the stuff that you want to eat be balanced about it you know hey be healthy for your baby and it's gonna be so much better for you postpartum too and just feeling better about yourself and just feeling healthy too so those are basically it another thing that I've noticed is my hair has grown so stinking much when I was pregnant with Alethea my hair didn't even touch my shoulders if you guys have been here for a minute my hair was up to here like it did not touch my shoulders and now it's so stinking lungs so I've noticed it's grown a lot I don't feel like my skin is like glowy and like healthy like they always say you're gonna get a pregnancy glow my skin is so dry that I think that's basically I feel like I covered a lot so hopefully I answered you guys's questions if you have any more questions let me know down below I'll try my best to answer them I'll also try my best to link as much of the stuff that I have here if you guys are pregnant congratulations I'm so excited for you enjoy this time rest when you need to rest cookie if you want to eat that cookie it's not that big of a deal if you get a stretch mark you are still beautiful I promise you it will be so stinking worth it and you are gonna just love on that baby so hard that you will forget about everything Oh last thing that I will touch on because I've gotten a quite a few questions about this and that is about like corona and everything that's going on honestly I'm trying not to freak out and worry about it because maybe things will be different in a couple of months I don't know but I'm really trying not to let myself get upset about there or trying to get anxious because that's not gonna do anything so I'm really trying not to think about it whatever happens happens my birth plan I don't have one I learned with the first one that birth plans are useless because they normally don't go to plan anyway so I'll link all my old pregnancy videos and my birth video at temple if you guys want I had a 30 hour labor with leave Mia it was intense so for me like anything will be better than my first experience honestly like could it be worse in 30 hours I don't know and they say with a second baby it's a lot easier a lot faster so hopefully that what ends up happening because we've been we've been here before we've done this before so hope you guys enjoyed this video again let me know any other questions you guys have it thank you so much for watching I love you so much and I will see you my next video bye good morning guys and welcome back to today's vlog where do I begin so it is day I think like fifteen or sixteen of staying inside of the house and honestly it has not been that bad my house has never been so organized I'm caught up on laundry I'm like doing extra activities I'm working out I feel like it has been a very nice refresh for me honey are you proud of how clean the house has been yes this is really great feels like we just moved in what do you mean like everything is like organized yeah yes yeah because I feel like when so we've been in the tester how many months now six months yeah yeah so at first it was like super organized like very minimal very cluttered like none of that but then a real quick we started to color up this house and it was giving me such bad anxiety and yeah exactly yeah but we were able to organize I'll show you guys upstairs in a second but we were able to organize everything up there so now we can start focusing on baby boys in there three which I'm super excited about so I'll show you guys what I plan on doing in there it's a little bit hard right now because I can't really order any furniture I mean I can order it but like most of the stuff that I wanted to get from him is for my Kia like I wanted to get the IKEA crib which is the same one that Leigh Thea has and we have an Ikea in Michigan so I don't want to order it online and pay for shipping and all of that if I can just go pick it up myself so I'm gonna wait until stores open again which I don't know when that's gonna happen or today I am working on my devotional and finishing it back up Jordan is going to help me and kind of proofread everything so as I work he's gonna proofread and like fix stuff I had already started so he kind of has to go through that and then Celeste is actually gonna put it into actual format and make it pretty and you guys are gonna end up seeing because right now I'm just working national for Google Docs so as if the process is kind of going like me writing it doing it and then you sending it to Jordan um editing proofreading like fixing any of like my grandma mistakes hmm because I make this all the time and then over to Celeste where she'll make it pretty and graphic II and like look very aesthetic and exciting so I'm so stinking excited for years to get this if you have no idea what I'm talking about I will link my makeup tutorial video up here because that's where I talk about it and explain everything so I'll link it up here but yes devotional coming to you soon Oh Fleur we gonna do that now are you when are you going grocery shopping till later okay cool let's work on that little belly update so I am currently 28 weeks this is what my belly looks like I actually just posted a first and second trimester update video so if you guys are curious about that I will link that up here for you guys I talk so much and give it so many details and helpful tips must-haves for pregnancy all of that so if you guys are curious I will link it down below as well but yeah I can't like really lift up my arms in this outfit because when I do you can see this part underneath but yeah this sweater is from made while and then these jeans my friend Esther actually gave them to me she wore these when she was pregnant but she's not pregnant anymore and she was like hey did you wanna borrow these and then when I get pregnant again I'll take them back and then we'll just keep switching so I'm not exactly sure what they're from but I'll have to check on the back and I'll let you guys know and I'll try to find it down below but they're very comfy and like super duper cute I love the rips what oh thank you I think Jordans gonna check for you guys they're from the leg looks essentials I've never heard of that company I'll try to I will look him up thanks honey what the whiny another morning the afternoons we Eaton's sympathy me buzz     what you doing honey I'm doing some sketches for our patio outside yeah gonna get that done we got a submitted to our HOA and the township for permits then we could have our contractor work on it yeah recording the whole thing guys I don't have a tripod on my camera so I'm always like make shifting some oh it doesn't make more sense duh makes shifting as high pride to set you guys on it's always the most setup because yeah it'll be pots or formula bottles whatever I can find the most breakable fragile delicate things that we own that's our camera on top of builds like a skyscraper okay I have like a tripod for when I do sit-down videos but it's like a big tripod but like when I do stuff like this or I'm like putting it on a table or something I don't have they're like 10 bucks okay so as you guys know we just moved into this house so we don't currently have a leg back yard patio or anything and so we have been trying to figure out what we want to do books and what we've been trying to do is figure out like a layout that we want to do so for me one of the biggest priorities is I wanted to have like a space where we can put both a dining table and like a little sectional and couch seating area and then for Jordan he really wanted a fireplace and like fireplace no the grilling area we're trying to like do this in a way that we're not gonna break the bank and not spend so much money on it so we're actually gonna do concrete outside so if you guys remember in our old house we actually had concrete outside and I loved it that's kind of like the theme we're going for you really want it to be more modern or clean and with concrete it's so easy to clean and just like power off and like I used to just use like the blow what does I think called metal blow-dryer the leaf blower leaf blower I hope everyone's here I've use that all the time it's just like dust off whatever is out there so we decided to do that because it's so much cheaper than pavers we got quoted for pavers and we could not believe how expensive it was we're trying to spend just enough where we can get it done and it's like the way we'd like it but also we're trying to like save as much money as we can sir actually maybe by the time this video goes up this will still be good sale but world market yesterday was having 40% off all of their outdoor furniture and we currently don't have any outdoor furniture we sold all of our ones that we had were in a previous house so I was able to get quite a few pieces for 40% off so if that's still a sale that's going to link it down below for you guys but definitely like if you know you're gonna be doing something like wait to buy it until the sale goes but I thought we would show you guys so our backyard is just like honestly such a square we just have like a sliding back door this right here is there for code and for safety because we currently don't even have any stairs to go outside and it's our back sliding doors basically not functional at this point right yes to get a better reason basically a 2 foot drop right there so Jordan just threw this out it looks so cute I'm not finished yet I mean do you want to like like the layout ok we're going to put everything when you see this again it'll be done basically done mm-hmm was that too fast who knows sure hi welcome back okay so look how fine I was able to little dry it helps having a straight edge like a ruler or something like that makes the process a lot less painful okay so right here it's like right here is if you were like walking straight out yes is the sliding back door right here notice the arrow oh yeah cute so you know which way it slides really well that's for anyways so as you walk out there's like three steps that bring you down because we're up about two feet off the actual ground yeah it's gonna be concrete so it's gonna be like leveled with the grass mm-hmm and then as you come out to the left here get the little outdoor grill kitchen area that kind of thing our contractor said when he made a good point I wouldn't have noticed this or thought of this book when they build houses they dig out like a little bit farther from where the actual foundation is in order to set the footer and set the foundation all that so they need space to work essentially when they go back in and backfill with dirt and all that it's still very soft it's not like compacted and super pressed down yes you don't want to put the footer really close to the house because that's gonna sink and beyond level and start cracking all that so anyways we're putting flower beds essentially for about three feet all the way around the perimeter of the house yeah so right here we're gonna put flowers because this is where the house is so it'd be like flowers and then the concrete start yes so then as you kind of go off to the left of the house it'll be like a grill a little pizza oven I think we're gonna try to make it my contractor said he's pretty confident he knows how to do it right so I'll be helping him with that trying to learn a few things along the way it'll just be like a fun DIY project and save a lot of money doing it that way and just kind of like prep hang out I love to grill I love like have people over so I can grill for multitude of people dad I love it it's great it's so then when you go to the right side of the house you'll notice there's just a little walkway here we intentionally kept this like very open because we didn't want a lot of stuff locking our view I guarantee the dogs are gonna run from the house do not go on the steps they're gonna jump over the steps and then run into the grass yeah cuz they're just crazy like that yeah so we're trying to keep this very like open very minimal just basically like a foot traffic path to go back and forth so you got grilling and kind of food prep area over here and then the house is here where you come out and then over here you walk towards like the living space so back here we have a couple couches and a coffee table really good sale at world market hashtag please sponsor this video I'm just kidding no over here we have like a little dining outdoor dining area with a bench and some more chairs so it's kind of simple it's not like a super complex layout or concept but it's functional and its kind of got everything that we need milena loves being outside yeah I remember when Alethea was born I was outside all the time yeah she was maybe three four months old kind of May June July every morning Willie and would make breakfast and go out and eat outside on the patio at like 7:00 in the morning I'd always breastfeed her outside I'd always I had her pack and play outside actually and this wasn't she like couldn't even set up yet so I just put her in there and she just lay down and I would have my devotional out there and take my coffee up there like I love to be outside so I'm so excited about this Jordans a little project was the basement now I feel like this is my little pipe up in my little multi-family yeah yeah and I'm excited for plants and like planting my plants out there I'm reading things to life so I'm very excited about that so we'll keep you guys updated on how everything goes it's honestly not gonna take that long well good pull permits and we have to have the HOA approve every so once things settle down a little bit now we'll be able to do that which is good because then it gives us more time to save yeah we're trying to do this as we were going to do I think you mentioned this but we were gonna do pavers and it was literally gonna be like quadruple the price of way I know of what we wanted to spend and then we're like okay well why don't we do like a nice concrete stamping or design in the concrete has got great super simple they just pour it and then the sidewalk I don't we made a basic yeah but we're gonna use like rugs I found a really cute rocket target but a couple weeks ago super easily gained like what do you need to maintain yeah and I like that you can like power wash it I remember we used to scrub our other one we'd like actually like clean it with soap and water like it it's very low maintenance so she's pretty excited about that but um do you want to come help me show them a nursery and like what I want to do sure I just went on line and it's not what every husband is dying to do okay so for baby boy's room I'm doing something a little bit different um ilithyia's room I did like the typical like crib dresser rocking chair situation for his room I actually want to do a daybed in there and the reason for that is because with alisios rocking chair I did not she like doesn't like to be rocked and I personally don't like breastfeeding on the rocking chair but you like the rocking chair she likes my rocker that's what Molina was trying to say just when the orden rocks her so I have seen other people put day beds in nurseries like you can just sleep in there with a baby like it's a spot where you can just chill out I can breastfeed on there and lay down like be super cozy so I've been eyeing this one from world market and actually on sale like this morning I was like freaking out cuz it's on sale but this is a daybed that I would like to put in huh or in his room and then I'll show you guys the rest of the layout it's kind of like what I'm thinking about it doing so cameraman okay so this is where I normally film most of my leg sit-down videos because I have that ledge set up with like the picture frames and stuff and I really wanted to keep that so I'm actually gonna take those that artwork cuz I made all of those and that is gonna go into my office but I'm gonna keep the ledge there and I'm gonna put new pictures so my sister and I are gonna like DIY some like boyish pictures my theme in this room is neutrals of course but then also a hint of like a Foresti green like a deep green so that's where I'll incorporate that but I have a daybed right here well this is normally a daybed it's open right now because my sister sleeps in this room but she's gonna take all this furniture to her apartment whenever she goes back to school and then the daybed that I just showed you guys will go right here underneath that so I won't have an issue of him like reaching for that or anything like that that won't like be a problem and then his his crib is actually gonna go over here and I'm gonna get the same crib than I have for Lacey yeah which is the IKEA one it's like $79 I love it it's really cute so that is gonna go right here and then I'm still debating where to put his dresser / like changing table because I do want a smaller one like I'm talking like really small I don't want a large one like Alethea's cuz he has a really big walk-in closet but right here yeah so there's this but the only thing is that the door opens right here so then once a date bed isn't here I'll get a better idea and this will be close to this is double the size so it'll literally come to your like stop right here yeah so if it's not too cramped I'll put it right here but then I can also put it on the window I don't know how that would look or feel or if it'd be too drafty I don't know but I have to play around with it but either I can put it there or you can put it there or even in the closet oh that's kind of weird isn't it that's weird what the teaching table in the closet yeah it's already freaking me out that you have a dresser in there so yeah but that is my planet for the nursery again things are kind of on hold because most stores are closed and like I'm like limited to what I can get online so hopefully I'll be able to get that stuff soon but first thing we need to do is like clean clear out this room and then we can freshly start and I'm gonna do wallpaper in here too which I'm really excited about I like the removing we do that's that better yeah that's cute maybe put it up a little bit this yeah good job I was struggling okay it's around at five o'clock now Alethea is down for a nap so she has been napping like much later in the afternoon which honestly it first has like that's kind of annoying but it has actually worked really well because when she naps it's when we get to work out so that is what I've been doing sorry I'm out of breath I went up the stairs I'm not fit because like I've been working out three times a week so every other day and I've been following an app called open fit so Jordan and my sister will work out on stairs Jordan like set up like a little gym in our garage because gyms are closed so he kind of likes that something up and him and my sister and his friend Caleb will do some stuff like together but I can't keep up with him and I don't want to do what they do I'd rather do like full-body workouts and full-body stuff so I'm gonna get ready for that right now I'm gonna put on my workout clothes Jordan is grocery shopping right now and once he gets back I will show you guys a quick haul of what we've been doing for meals I'm going to change it real quick it's kind of cold out so I will have to like layer up a bit okay Jordan is back and has all the stuff so I just like separated all on the island to show you guys like daily meals so we actually have three meals but we have enough for each one that we'll be able to have it for dinner and then lunch the next day so with all of this keep in mind we currently have six people total in our house so it may seem like a lot of food bits for six people every meal so that's why tonight we are making some hamburgers I have my own gluten-free bread but this is what we have for burgers so far and then we have like some tomatoes and other things over there another meal we are going to be making is grilling some chicken and then I'm gonna make tons of different veggies and then I write as well but we already have rice in the pantry or a spinach and arugula these are just extra veggies of other things that I just frequently eat melanie loves carrots Alethea loves carrots we'll just always have those on hand and then this honey mustard is the best honey mustard in the entire world it's so good on burgers and just anything so I'm so happy Jordan was able to find this if you've never tried it highly highly recommend some bacon some ground beef this is just good to have if I'm gonna make like a pasta or something some cucumbers oat milk I've been using oat milk in my coffee and it's so stinking yummy Jordan gets normal milk and then some butter more yogurts for Jordan eggs for us we absolutely love eggs every morning awake he loves eggs and then these are all the veggies that we normally get every week because I always try to give a leafy if I did I say veggies are fruit these are fruit fruit that we get every week so normally strawberries bananas I had him get Kiwi this week we got some mangoes cuties in grape and so this will last us like a whole week of eating and then the last meal that we're gonna be having is salmon I absolutely love salmon I make this recipe all the time and always show you guys on Instagram but it's so easy you basically put this on a sheet you cut up these Tomatoes and red onion and put it all together and it's the simplest of easiest thing to make ever and then you just like eat it with rice so that is another thing that we will have this week but that is basically it literally all my recipes that I get are from Pinterest if you guys follow me on Instagram you'll see that I will always put my Bubbe's for stuff that I find on Pinterest so on Instagram I'll be sharing these meals if you guys want to see like the actual recipes of them so I'll share them with you guys but I'm gonna put this away real quick because they already started working out so I don't want to be left out so I'm gonna put this way and then I will show you guys my workout   okay I'm all done I'm not sweating because it's so stinking cold outside so but my weight my workout was great I did a stretch in what was it called it's cold this top one right here this blue one is one that I did it's called strength training so it was a 15 minute workout and it was like a full-body thing with a couple of ways so super easy super simple and I feel great now so I'm gonna get started on dinner so literally this is what I basically do every single night so like I said tonight we're gonna have burgers with taddy's and stuff so I just went onto Pinterest because I've actually never I normally like will buy like salmon burgers or turkey burgers I've actually never made my own burger before okay so I found a recipe that I like here I'm gonna save it in case any of you want to try it I'm gonna save it in my Pinterest under my yummy highlight or yummy board which is where I like save all my food stuff so I'm gonna get started on that Alethea is still napping which is so good because it's been so nice being able to workout and then as shoes I'm gonna working out I'll start cooking dinner and getting things ready and then whenever she wakes up I'll bring her down here have her help me cook make food with her and all of that and then then it's her bedtime so you go is my super fast in the afternoon if I'm not working out cuz I'm only doing it three times a week if I'm not working out normally I will just show on the couch or I'll work on like graphics for my videos or a work on the devotional which is like what I've been doing for the past couple of weeks so yeah that's normally holiday goes but I'm gonna get started on this   alright I made the burgers I cut up a couple of things put all the toppings together this is normally held just like throw it on the table for everyone to just serve themselves I'm just gonna wait for Jordan to grill them miscellanea is actually still sleeping it's 6:30 though so I'm gonna go wake her up because she's supposed to be in bed by 8:00 so I'm gonna wake her up give her a little snack while Jordan makes those and grills them and then that is it for our night so if you guys are curious as to like what Alethea eats all day and like what she does I will link a video up here that I did last week that was so much fun it was like a day in the life of a baby well over 1 year old and so if you're curious about that I'll link that up there for you guys but that is going to be all for today's video I hope you guys are enjoying the vlogs that are back let me know what videos you'd like to see next I love you guys so much and I will see in the next video bye do you think no and you're always happy wearing no with that get that in the camera don't move my baby yeah hey guys welcome back to today's vlog so today is a very exciting day we just released my seven day study on the book of a root so that is out now and it has been so nice seeing how many of you guys are like on fire oh we won't go outside we single outside levena go so Jordan I were up until 4 o'clock in the morning last night finishing up the devotional it was done but it was like I don't know I wanted it to be perfect so I kept like rephrasing a couple things and then I kept like changing the graphics and then once you change one thing because I wanted to try my best to get everything like each day on one page I would have to like go back and like re graph everything to make everything fit but it turned out so good and so excited it has been so syncing overwhelming seeing all your messages and seeing so many of you on fire for the Lord which is obviously the whole point of this so it has been very exciting I will link that down below for you guys it's absolutely free it's a PDF so you have the option to download on your computer your phone or your tablet or whatever and then you can do it from there or you can just print off the entire thing and then each day just work from there that's what I'm going to do I'm gonna print it off cuz I don't want to have to be on my phone or anything like that so I've seen a lot of you have been printing as well so I will leave that all down below it's absolutely free it's just PDF I'll have it linked and I'm so excited for you guys set today is a beautiful day we started it off for morning and nice and slow it's like currently like 50 some degrees which to us Michigan people is really nice out so we're gonna go and have like a little picnic outside right now I'm gonna get our gather mat I'm gonna like put a bunch of stuff outside we don't have our patio done yet as you guys know but we're gonna just improvise it's just so stinking beautiful right now this is currently the little setup I have for her down here I have all these books I've four books out right now and it keeps them in in this little container and then this guy out that is supposed to be like different sounds and different instruments but she actually likes playing with this and fitted them Wow can you play it back can you show me a favorite thing to do is like put it back in the slot which is really good for just like fine motor that's a really good skill to have so I have that here I have this little guy set up and she has two little minis and then this cute little guy from a small shop and I can link it down below but that's all I have this month that's all I have this week for her down here I don't have too many things you any show of you one yet to list did you go to so a little bit before she turned one yeah I think it I think before her birthday she had teeth I'm pretty sure we were at Disney one her teeth came in and we went before her birthday but she has two little teeth and then she has a tap one and then the one right next to it coming in and we didn't even notice that she was teething she doesn't really like change or do anything different I noticed that she didn't have that much of an appetite and I thought it was strange then I was like oh maybe she's just not hungry I don't know and then the next morning she woke up that she had a little two-piece so I have a Ryan and Marissa pacifier that is like hollow on the inside so I actually filled it up with water and froze it and then I've been giving that to hurt for her to like chew on because I can't imagine that like it's horribly painful she probably just like tries to ignore but I guarantee that like she'll probably want something to soothe it so I've been giving her that and she liked we'll just like munch and chew on it so that's the only thing she doesn't seem too bothered otherwise but that's just a little tip for any of you mamas is to just fill up a C with some nice cold water okay I got our wagon I have a gatherer mat and then another little blanket that I like to use the upper waters our speaker my water too - he's putting her shoes on and then I have her pack and play I think I'll bring this back there - you like she's like being in there   you   you guys have no idea how happy the son makes me and just good weather makes me so we were out there for about like three hours actually just put Alexia down for her nap but I have my set up quarters and I ordered a couple weeks ago and I wanted to do a little haul cuz I got a couple of things that are bump friendly but I'm so sorry I can't bump friendly but also cute like little spring stuff that I was able to find so I absolutely love thredUP and thank you to them for working on today's video with me I've worked in so many times before they are my favorite place ever to shop from so they are the world's largest online thrift store where you can get up to 90 percent

their website because we can't go into stores anywhere so this has been a great I personally will always get stuff for myself I always get stuff released yeah on there as well so I just absolutely love them and have been using them for quite a while now and so many of you have raved about it how much you have enjoyed it too so I thought I'd do a little try on haul some of the stuff I've ever actually already worn and so many of you asked me where this stuff was from but it is all it from thredUP so I'm going to show you guys a couple of things their app is super easy to navigate through so for me my biggest tip is for you to shop through your favorite clothing stores so I always go on to anything from made well anything from Zara anything from like Topshop or ASOS so I'll always look up my favorite stores first and then if I'm not able to find anything then you can go through different sections of like pants or dresses shoes and then I always put a filter at the top of like what my sizes so I'm not like wasting any time scrolling through things that aren't gonna fit me so I thought that would be some helpful tips for you guys they are offering you guys 30% off so use my code and I will leave a link down below as well but 30% off is a really good deal so if you guys haven't tried it out already I will have that link down below but let me pull out a couple of things show you guys that I got all right here's the first outfit it is a jumpsuit already wore this a couple of weeks ago on Instagram I got so many questions about it but it is from a company called cotton on and it wasn't originally $36 but I got it for 19 so it's super comfy and like super stretchy so obviously I can wear this when I'm not pregnant but because of the material it's such a good quality that it just stretches and looks so stinking cute so I wanted something more colorful but like something stretchy and just like comfy to throw on as it gets warmer so I feel like this is the perfect thing for that oh and we have a special guest someone to say to me come over yeah no okay so here is another jumpsuit that I got obviously I was in the mood for jumpsuits I just think they look so stinking cute on pregnant women so this limits from a company called simple and it was originally $35 and I was able to snag it for 19 so a really great deal I think it looks so it sneaking to you again it's not Maternity but I tried to get like a stretchy material that would stretch with the bumpy bumps yeah so cute let me do for you like this oh so stylish okay so next thing I did get a sweater just to kind of hold me over until it is officially warmer here in Michigan so I got this made well sweater it was originally a hundred and twenty dollars and I got it for 25 hello like what I love buying made well fed up because made well has really nice quality sweaters but they do tend to be on the pricier side but like literally like you cannot even tell like this is such good material such good quality so I just absolutely love it and I do get sweaters that are a little bit longer so it does cover the bump but I love this so much oh how could I say no to that thanks okay so the last thing I got is this jacket it is a black jacket it's not a jean jacket it's kind of like a quarter I I don't know it's very different the company it's from is called the charter club it was originally $70 and I got it for 11 so look at that I feel like this is like the perfect jacket to wear like right now during the spring time but also over dresses or over just anything because it is more because it is more lightweight so I am obsessed with this and I will leave a link down below and if you guys use my code you can save at 30% off and thank you again to thread up for working with

want to say 30 percent off I love you so much and I will see you in my next video bye bye so cash today super casual super casual if any on today he sure doesn't look weird or like two on each other hey guys and welcome back to my Channel today Jordi is here hello we are gonna be sharing it in names that we like but won't be using and I say that kind of loosely because we still don't have this child named sure it's been a bit of a struggle for us boy names are really hard yeah there's not as many like because we're the girls thing like oh that sounds pretty right or that sounds girly yeah but for a guy you don't be like oh I like how that name sounds just a little bit different it's harder yes yes and you'll kind of see with our list a lot of these names are more unlike nothing girly side cuz they're not girly names but again there's a bee in the house but absolutely     no more opening the doors close them we need a big either we need a net we have net all right sorry about that it's a really really really pretty day today so I have the windows open at night black back sliding door doesn't have a screen on it currently so I just had it open so Abby just came in we have to take that for the day we're out of breath I'm not working out again today intense guys where's my notebook you know the beat I'm sorry okay so boy names have been really hard but especially hard because our daughter's name is Alicia very different very unique name so it's kind of hard and we kind of want them to match I originally said I wanted all of our kids names to begin with the letter A and I have found that that's gonna be really hard to do so I've kind of let go of that if they all happen to have a names then great if not then I'm not gonna throw a fit over it because you know it's difficult it's hard naming a child and the reason we don't share the name so we didn't share lacy his name whenever we figure out his name we're not going to share it it's because people just like love to tell you their opinion on it because they think that when the child isn't here they tell you that there might still be a chance that you'll change it even though if you really like the name so because we I've noticed that like when you ask somebody there if somebody asks you what are you thinking of for a name when you tell them that just they here what do you think of this name nice what if I decided the names good yeah so yeah so that's the biggest reason it feels like they they feel like that gives them a right to say that they don't like it or whatnot but we love those unsolicited opinions yes you know exactly what we're talking about it happens all the time we're not handing out anyone it's just it's just always been the thing if you tell someone that it'd be these names just funny how people think yes yeah unless you just explicitly say like we've named the child this then there's not much that they can do but when you're still on edge about a name people love to like give you opinions about it okay so I want you to read them all and I will respond to them since these are moreso names that Molina likes okay you didn't can okay I told you the names that I liked okay so what is it they're contenders for possibilities so that's why we're not actually using them here because these are names that we are not using but still kind of like but it's more that Molina likes these names yes okay ready I really like the name axel I think that's cute but I know a couple of people whose babies names are axel so it would be kind of hard for us to use that name because they get a new hat like it's so hard naming a child because you automatically think of people that have-not names yeah so it can be a little hard I like the name Titus I really like that name I'm ended up using that yeah well later not this baby but we should put that I'm like Arden it that's our possible list that there may be honest we're not using for this pregnancy but then for another one yes I really like the name Thor but then it reminds me of like the whole movie wait what's Thor's brother's name Loki I like that one too Loki I like it you wanna mail our son Captain America know about Hulk okay next name is Atticus I like this one really like a lot I think Atticus is a really like it's sophisticated it's no it's sophisticated but it's like the trouble with my last name CCID well our last name since daddy is always my first is there's not a lot of good first names there not many to pick from that go well with it so anything that ends with an or like its sound doesn't really work because it blends with the C from C Ciotti so if you have like Atticus CCID it sounds like Atticus cci it doesn't really it doesn't come well we kind of to avoid certain names or names that end with certain words Leo really cute not leonardo not Leon but Leo yes I like the nicknames of names well he thinks like the the actual full name is a nickname and I try to convince her no that's just short for Leonard or leo Nardo Leonard yeah Leonard that's what we people go by a Leo and then they're like milena doesn't have a concept of like your legal name we're like your official name that's on your birth certificate she only thinks we put Leo CCIT nut Leonardo or Leone it just leo but you can't do that the Hessians naming their kids north and west and eats himself I wouldn't consider them like the benchmark like child naming standards biting his flesh you can basically do whatever you want do what you will you want to name them leo and that'd just be it and you can do that sure knocks knocks is cute I like the way that Knox looks it's very like I like the end in the Owen ex I think it looks pretty together next Finn do you like Finn Finn and his twin brother flapper like what what's that shark fin leopard guys these are not names that I thought we're good these are Melina are good we're not gonna name our kid after the Friendly Ghost I know this is why it's on the list of names we won't be using what we like that's the thing you like ash from Pokemon I don't watch Pokemon I don't the reference okay these are woman no they're not Sawyer that's cute that's a normal name Sawyer I feel like it could be it's one of those gender-neutral yeah like Jordan could be male or female yes yeah that's the other thing it's been really difficult to find a Greek name wait I like these yeah I mean like his name is Greek it's been hard to find a Greek name for a male yeah cuz they're always out of them sounding like gods they're all pagan god Zeus we're not trying to name our kid like its name next one is cliff Matt Clifford I just click stylus that's cute no people in America it is yeah Paul and Silas in prison we should we should save that in you what it ends with an S so Silas see see it yes I don't even like the the s sound in Latin language anyways especially when you're like saying the Lord's Prayer like I member when I was in college I went to a Lutheran College and they would do the Lord's Prayer like almost every day and when they got to the point it was everybody like the whole congregation right so everyone's like forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us it was like 10 trillion s sounds it just sounded weird sound like a bunch of snakes hiss I'm like so right over but that's why this time I have like some you don't like that I only have a couple too many extras I mean CCIT has c.c. but try to avoid as much as possible yeah or cheap shoddy is actually the original Asher I like this game a lot but if you watch how to get away with murder there's a guy on there his name is Asher so think of him so I don't think I would use that but I like the new and it's also a paid leave from like Babylon spelled differently mmm yes H you are yeah next name is sage fun fact about this name is when I was pregnant with lethea that is what we had named the baby before we found out was a girl and we told people nothing no that was Sampson hey no we're thinking of naming Sampson sage it was I remember we went to the divins lake you know we told them it was sage and then your mom kept saying that she could see sage and like I was started to show do you remember that yes and then that was when we learned that you don't tell people the name because then they started using it and then we got so tired of the name that we don't know obviously switching it cuz she ended up being a girl but it was a learning lesson so sage was the name that we really liked and we're going to name ilithyia but then that didn't end up working out but we're not gonna use it for this one because it's just I don't know I start with an S sage CC honey that doesn't roll off the tongue that well yeah okay next name Ali this is so cute that's a very cute name Ali CCIT nice yeah wait that's the rest of my list you have other things on there like salt and pepper and you're just going for a minute thing like Oh cumin Oh paprika basil honey what it is you like but like art ones that weren't considering I haven't you a lot of people thought like my dad will keeps it what does that mean my dad keeps saying like that's a great Italian Angela yeah Angelo my dad keeps thinking in name of Angelo I like Angelo I just feel like it's it's just so a town I know a lot of Angelo's we're thinking like what's an a name for a boy that's Greek Italian something in that line Angelo's like one of the most popular but I don't know I think we need to think a little more inside the box maybe maybe go the other way in the Bible towards the Old Testament there's so many names in the Bible that I don't ever realize they're in the Bible like that in Hannah I didn't know it was in the Bible mm-hmm there's like so many common names that we like use nowadays that are biblical but people don't even realize it I don't so yeah sorry money you are not yet named but we have 10 weeks 10 weeks to figure out what we will name them so what my mother doesn't weirdest thing like fully sticks out does he belly get early hit you still   feel like I'm starting to get a couple of judge marks over here because my belly is like really

I am so excited for this video because with quarantine going on I feel like this is the perfect opportunity for us girls to try this out so the whole reason okay first of all let's talk about the obvious my hands yes I went a little crazy with my self-tanner and ended up getting some on my palms let's just ignore that it's not the cutest look and it won't come off so let's just pretend my hands don't look crazy and last thing both my dog's decided that they want to be here when I'm filming this video Delilah is chewing on a bone so hopefully that doesn't become distracting but they are both back there so today's video is going to be all about Ali months choked up and I thought I would just share with you guys tips what it feels like and just like overall just like do an entire video just talking about menstrual cups because so many of you asked me on Instagram about it I mentioned that I had been using one before I got pregnant and yes I'm currently pregnant so I am seven months pregnant right now I don't know if you can really see my belly but I am pregnant so I haven't had to use this in a while but after having my daughter I decided that I wanted to start using a menstrual cup and it was the best decision I had ever made because I thought to myself like okay a child just came out of there surely I can fit this little cup in there so if you liked this video or if you want to see more Girl Talk videos let me know what you'd like to see next comment that down below make sure to subscribe before you leave so you don't miss out on any of my videos I post things about face baby fashion literally everything so let's go ahead and get started I'm just quickly gonna walk you through like my period of journey so I actually got my period when I was ten years old I was in elementary school when I got my period I was super duper young and for that first year I wore a pad but I just could not stand it I have a very very heavy flow like very heavy it's very common for me to leak completely through a pad tampon whatever within the first like one or two days and then it like slows down so for me I really just didn't like wearing pads even when I was 10 because it was just so much and I always felt wet and slimy and goopy and gross down there and I just did not like it so I started using tampons so I used tampons okay so now I'm 23 so I started at 10 I'm 23 I used tampons for 13 years of my life now if we do the math of how many that is normally I would go through about a box which is like normally 30 with each period so let's a little bit let's do a little calculation here of how many Pat tampons I have gone through in my life so normally a pack of 30 and you get your period once a month so just me alone I have roughly gone through 4680 tampons not only is that excessive that's expensive and that is so harmful to the environment so just throwing that out there before I even knew about menstrual cups that's how many I had gone through which is bad this is really that's a big number that's a lot my periods are very heavy very just like uncomfortable I get really bad cramps like the cramps where you're just like laying in bed all day like you can't move you can't function like really bad but then I found out about this guy and I swear all my problems were solved I had heard about menstrual cups but I was kind of like that sounds gross like I don't want like what there's blood in this thing and you have to put how does this fit in there where does this go I don't understand once I had my daughter after I delivered I got my period back I was three months postpartum four months postpartum something like that and I was like you know what I want to try something different I'm tired of using tampons I'm tired of like leaking through them I'm tired of having cramps all the time I'm tired of having to change every two hours I was just like over the whole tampon thing and I was like I had just given birth to a baby that was this big I was like there's definitely room for this thing to fit in there because for me that was like the biggest thing I was like how is that gonna fit and trust me it does fit whether you've had or not so I decided to try it out the first couple of times that I tried it out I did not get any cramping I didn't have any spillage I didn't have any issues and it was the best thing ever I would always forget I was on my period when I started using this and I think the reason for that was because I didn't get cramping now I'm not sure if there's like science or scientific data on this but I don't cramp when I have this in I don't know what it is when I have tampons I cramp like crazy when I have this in I don't get cramps now I'm not sure if that's related to this or because after I had my daughter things are different so I don't get cramps as frequently I'm not sure but if you have really bad cramps it's worth a try to try this out what else was I gonna say oh and then the other thing is I frequently forget I was on my period because I wasn't having to change my tampon every two hours so that was kind of like my background story of like how I started using the menstrual cup and how I've liked it and enjoyed it I love it so much I will never go back to using anything else I've gotten all my girlfriends and everyone using this as well because I just can't encourage so many people to use it let's start with the price the price of a cup range is anywhere between twenty to thirty five dollars which is very affordable compared to how much you would spend on tampons let's do that math again I think I don't have that number pulled up what was it 12 times 30 how much does the box of tampons like twelve dollars or something what that can't be right according to this in the 13 years that I used tampons I spent 56 thousand dollars on tampons is that right that's right hello that is incorrect math and that was not how much money how much does end up be a teen hundred dollars is something attacked 1819 roughly nineteen hundred dollars but still thirty dollars compared to that is still a lot cheaper so love math okay well either way you're saving tons of money with this because it's reusable so you're spending $30 once and done and then I'm pretty sure you have to change them but not nearly as frequently as you'd have to like beginning a box of tampons the one that I have is from a company called salt I found it at Target so they have the Diva Cup I feel like that's what everyone knows Diva Cup salt I really like salt because of their packaging and they also had like a little pouch for you to put this inside of so very affordable very good price once you first buy this you want to sanitize it because obviously like this is gonna be inside of you so that's the biggest thing is you have to be very particular about the way that you sanitize and just keeping it clean you're not gonna want to be touching it like I've been touching it this entire time but you will want to sanitize so the easiest way to do that is to just boil it like when you buy a menstrual cup there's always instructions and the actual like box when you go to buy it that will like walk you through these things but basically you want to sanitize it sanitizing entire thing and then it's time for you to use it so my biggest tip is for everyone to at least try this especially during quarantine right now because you're not gonna be really leaving your house and you have the comfort of your own home to be able to like try this out and explore and like get comfortable with it so the first couple of times you do it is kind of odd it does feel kind of strange like I'm not denying that but once you get the hang of it and once you get used to it it's become second nature it becomes super easy to do and just whatever okay there's different ways that you can insert it but for me I personally do the sea fold so that is when you pinch it down like this and then turn it like that and insert it if you look at a diagram of like what your vagina looks like and how this sits inside of it it makes a lot of sense now I know a lot of women say like oh well I'm a virgin or oh I've never had a baby like it's gonna be painful it's honestly not because our vaginas are our vaginas are stretchy vaginas are very stretchy and you'll be okay I think the biggest thing is you know where your cervix is because I have been told by my gynecologist that I have a very low cervix so that means like the spacing is smaller some women have larger cervixes so I feel like that might be the only thing that might affect it so you might want to get a cup that's like shorter or longer depending on how low or high your cervix is but not everyone knows that because not every dine ecologist tells people that so that was just like a random fact that I knew about myself that my gynecologist had told me but okay basically when you go into the bathroom I like to do it from the back because I feel like it's just easier that way I mean I guess you could do it from the front but for me I don't know I feel like the back is just easier I normally will slide in this top part first and then as soon as you slide in the top part the rest of it kind of just goes in and it opens up and sits in there like this so the biggest question I got was leaking and how all that works so this this is a big cup I know when we're on our period it feels like we're filling up three of these a day but I promise you you do not men straight as much as you think that you do and having this cup in made me realize that it's honestly not that much this little guy is there for you to be able to find it later when you go to change it so the first couple of days would be getting my period it's very very heavy and I normally have to change this every six hours now they say you can go 12 hours with this in so that technically means you should only be changing it twice within a 24 hour period which is like day a night basically and gets a preference depends on what you're comfortable with and what you would like to do but I will just say that I love changing this thing in the shower and that's definitely an option a lot of you were questioning and asking like how to change it when you're in public and I have yet to change it in public because you got such long spans of having it inside that you don't need to like change it when you're at Target if that makes sense like most of the time when you're going to be changing it's gonna be the morning or the night you're not really gonna be doing it in the middle of the day and if you are I'll give you tips on that too so let's say I've had this in for like six hours I'm done I'm ready oh it might wait before I get into that my thing about this is that when you pee it doesn't you don't feel it in there with tampons it drove me crazy every time I would pee my little what's it called my little string would always get wet and it was just so annoying and I would always have to change my tampon every time I peed or any time I went poopoo like it was so annoying so that is not a problem with this because you don't have to take it out when you pee every time like it's not it's not a thing but I feel like with my tampon I had to change it every time I peed because my my thing would get all wet and that was gross so you don't really have to do that with this so let's say you feel like it's getting full you're done you're ready to change it you go to the bathroom and the biggest thing is getting it out so think of this as a suction cup this little thing you are not gonna want to pull on that because that is just gonna scrape your insides and it's not gonna come out like think of it like like it's not don't do that what you're gonna want to do and this is what I was saying that it's gonna feel kind of weird the first couple of times you do it like it's gonna feel strange but you'll get used to it you'll get more comfortable with it so let's say the little guy is sitting in there so I would use my two fingers and if you have nails this actually makes it a lot better and a lot easier you'd feel that he's in there you would stick your fingers in there I know it's mm but trust me it's not that bad what you're gonna do is you're gonna feel for the actual cup so after you find it you're gonna find the actual cup and you're gonna want to pinch it like this so it's in there you're gonna want to pinch it and you are going to pull that thing out now it's gonna come out pretty easy because everything's basically really slimy in there anyway and then it's out like that so normally it will be filled with period blood obviously and then you just dump it into the toilet and then you're gonna go rinse this thing off so I will always rinse it off with like really hot water rinse the entire thing out make sure everything is gone in not in there and then same thing again to put it back in just squeeze push and back it goes very simple very easy it takes less than a minute to do and like I said the more comfortable you get with it the easier and faster you get with it so you don't even think twice about it I'll be just as quick as you changing a tampon or a pad or whatever if you're trying this out for the first time I highly suggest you try it out like in the shower so if you think it's gonna get really messy try it in the shower a couple of times now taking it out standing up and sitting down is a little bit different if you're standing up and to hang out in the shower I definitely suggest you like prompt and put your leg up somewhere because it's gonna be kind of hard to just like stand and do that you definitely want your leg up on something but like I said we're all in quarantine right now so you have plenty of time to like not have to worry about being in a public bathroom and having to deal with that like I said I haven't had to change it in public but I did look up some videos on how to do that if you are gonna do that so basically what you'll want to do is get a damp paper towel and then bring that into the toilet with you so that after you dump this out you can just get that damp paper towel and just clean around and then you can use it back up again and then just flush everything else so that's another quick easy way to do it but like I said unless you're out of your house for a very long time during the day you won't really need to do that until you get back home or before you leave for work another thing I do sleep with this in I'm not sure if it's recommended or what but I do and I just forget that in there that's my favorite thing I genuinely forget I'm on my period when I use this like I just forget about it because I'm not changing it that frequently I'm not getting cramps I feel fine like it's great I feel like I answered pretty much everything right is there anything else honestly I feel like that if you guys have any questions of something that I didn't touch on comment it down below and I try my best to answer all of your questions um but yeah honestly guys just I just think it's worth the try it least try it you know so much better for the environment so much better for your wallet I just like can't recommend you guys trying it at least try just try leave a link down below to a couple of other companies or different brands but I really like the company salt I thought it was really cute packaging I really like this like obviously that doesn't matter if it's cute but I'm just saying I liked their stuff and then in between periods what I'll do to store it is that the box actually came with a little thing for you to put inside of that's like a breathable cloth material so I'll store it in there and then once I get my period the next month I realized the entire thing again and then you just normally clean it and rinse it out when you go to change it every time and then once you go to store it you have to re sanitize so definitely be good about sanitizing it because this thing is literally going inside of you I hope you guys like this let me know how you end up liking it if you do end up liking it which I Karen to you what like just try it okay that's all it's all if you take anything away from this video I want you to try it and I promise you you will see how much better it is but I did say it again any questions you guys have let me know down below I'll try my best to answer them I really hope you guys enjoyed this video and that you're able to see it's not that scary it's not that bad but I love you guys and I will see you in my next video bye good morning the morning how long and downstairs right now in the basement waiting for Jordan Jordan y'all loves to procrastinate he's been progressing meeting all morning who do we need to do a little intro and outro for a podcast that we recorded last month with someone from compassion and so we need to like do the intro and outro portion of it excuse me I'm vlogging and you're distracting so I'm just waiting for him on that while I've been waiting for him I've been looking at my website and I cannot get over how many of you have been doing the Bible study and it makes me so it's stinking excited I'm actually gonna start working on a new one right now the next one I do will be longer though I was thinking of doing a 14 day study because as much as I love a seven day study I feel like it's perfect as like an introductory like a little intro if you've never done a devotional before like I feel like that the Routh study that I did is like the perfect way to do it because it's very simple it's free shorts very sweet there's like no pressure on it I feel like it was a really good intro but for those of us who do want to dive a little bit deeper and like continue this pattern and continue the habit of reading our Bibles every morning and everything I feel like a 14 day study is really good for that and a book that's a little bit longer so the Book of Ruth is only four chapters which is extremely short I don't think it's a shortest book of the Bible but four is not that many like you could literally read it in 10 minutes so the next one that I want to do is some camp doing 14 days and then possibly in the future even do a 30 day obviously those will take a lot longer like it's gonna take me double the amount of time that it took for me to do the Book of Ruth so I'm not even gonna put a date on that or even say one that's gonna be released I shouldn't have even told you guys that I'm gonna be starting on it so that's just a little spoiler a little tea of what I have been thinking about and wants to be doing but today I'm so excited because we're gonna be doing baby boys of nursery so I originally wanted to get wallpaper to put on one of the walls in his room which is where the daybed is gonna be but then I was like let me try to DIY it because I've never done wallpaper before and honestly I wasn't really finding anything that I was like obsessed with but I was finding really cute graphics and really cute like wall designs that I had seen people have done and have like di wide so I was like I wanna try so I'm gonna try that today I don't know how it's gonna go cuz I'm honestly not like super artistic especially when it comes to like a big wall and I'm gonna be drawing the same thing over and over again so it's basically gonna be like a mud cloth pattern and my theme in his room is neutrals obviously but then I wanted to incorporate some greens like a sage green olive e.type green in order to do that I wanted the mud cloth pattern to be kind of brown like a topi dark not too dark not too like I don't know it's gonna it's gonna be hard picking out a color because I can't go to the store only Jordan cancer he's gonna have to FaceTime me and he's gonna have to show me through FaceTime so it's gonna be a bit of a struggle to figure that out but yeah that's kind of the theme I'm going for okay where the heck is Jordan yeah okay shower today welcome welcome mr. procrastinators I needed to clear the paper jam out of the printer then somebody created I wasn't saying they're saying it was somebody mmm all right so we are about to record as an intern outro of great internet show yeah we had compassion international come actually to our house to record a podcast episode and we had a representative we've been in contact with really sweet gal and an alumni actually so this guy was a sponsored child back when he was young and graduated the sponsorship program and then basically had to apply and jump through all these hoops and show himself like an outstanding applicant for compassion to sponsor him to come to the United States disc to study ministry and he's currently at Moody Bible Institute or did he graduate no he's still there I'm still so stinking cool to hear an experience of a child now child anymore he's like in his 40s like he was one of like the first round of children to go through compassion so it was so cool to hear how like compassion directly impacted his life it's an experience like you don't hear that you hear of more people who sponsor other children and like they share oh I was really impactful for me or I got to go visit my sponsor children in their country or whatever but this was a whole different experience where we got to hear from him and just the difference compassion made in his life and having a sponsor in his life so we're like we got to hear from this guy we want to well I hear his story so we had him come over and we recorded an episode and we didn't want to worry about like doing an intro and edit things to make it sound nice yeah so we're like let's just hear from him and we'll go back in later and add in whatever we have to add in to make it like a full episode yeah so cool I can't wait for you guys to hear so say it started start pressing this yes but before we jump in we want to thank literati for sponsoring this episode say it say it won't ever just okay yes and before we jump in no we would like to thank lugar literati how do you you know say it three times I do said it literati I know be gonna say before we jump in we and before we jump and we would like to think literati for sponsoring today's video or today's episode episode all right we'll call that one sadistic I don't know why I struggle do not see me that whole thing that's better okay yes and Before we jump into today's episode we would like to thank literati for sponsoring this episode good         she gives the baby what some is the worst what does a cow make the sounds are coming are you blogging the camera are you blogging you should bug your day with your mom just got a package oh oh it is oh thank you help me my belly's big honey you got me this is heavy honey what the heck did I order monthly order right okay so I've been ordering from thrive for feel like a year and a half now maybe two years I don't know I like first and you got introducing them a while back it's an online membership based market so you can get everything that you can find in stores all like organic stuff to embers get 25 to 50% off the normal retail price so it just makes so much more sense to order on here but let me show you guys what I got so I normally get like the same things every time from them I needed to just stock up on a couple of things so I love their olive oil and then I buy this salt I don't know because I've ever heard of it it's called Celtic sea salt my whole with my holistic doctor is one that told me about this salt because most felt that like normal table salt doesn't actually have any minerals or anything in it and this stuff has like so many good ingredients in it so I was able to find it on thrive I got it in this form and then in future I also got it yeah I also got it in this form where you can just like easily pour it onto your food and stuffs I also got some matcha I wanted to try this I have seen so many people making really yummy matcha and it like I don't know it just looks so pretty and I kind of wanted to try it out so I got this it's unsweetened green tea powder but we love it so much especially since I have more of a restrictive diet it's so easy to just go onto their website and shop through my diet if you guys are doing paleo or if you're gluten-free dairy-free vegan they have all those options for you so I think it's so stinking convenient and they have it the best brand ever as well so not only do they have food stuff but they also have like spice stuff so I actually get my essential oils from them I just ran out of peppermint I always get peppermint and eucalyptus those are like the ones I always have but I also get like my spa stuff from there too I buy these magnesium flakes from them that is so good because you guys know I love my bath time so I'll only get on my spa stuff from them but I just need to smell this because and something that I think is really cool right now with everything that's going on is they still are working 24/7 to ensure that people are able to get their essentials but they're still maintaining their commitment to carbon neutrality and fair practices with their warehouse team which i think is really cool so so making sure to stay in stock in essential pieces and stuff which I was very excited to find because with my gluten-free bread it's very hard to find in stores they're the only ones I currently had it so I was very excited about that if you guys are also interested they have two different membership options you could do a monthly membership or you could do 12 months we have done the 12 month because it just makes the most sense and it ends up being like five dollars a month so it's very cost effective and just ends up being it's so worth it and today you can get up to 20 dollars in your shopping cart for you to be able to spend so I will leave that link down below but I love what I got I got your chips the zesty lime and I got more of this salt to the Celtic salt we have it like this and they had it like this yes yeah it was a lot cheaper alrighty I'm gonna pipe this stuff away and then we will head out to work he'll head out I'll just be in the car I mean this right here is the color I want so I figured you could take the whole drug in there to compare the colors I got ready good no no no no no no no no brown is such a hard color to like mansion swatch so you can just take this in grab a bunch of swatches in that same category bring it out to you yes shoes actually good yeah that's nice thinking but I was gonna have you bring this just so you know where to start cuz once you go in there guarantee you're gonna get overwhelmed with all the swatches okay or I'll just keep it in the car and I can compare to the swatches you bring out so you look crazy going into head the last thing we did with a mask and I love ya gonna win then and grab the stuff Jordans been the one that's been leaving the house I haven't been to a store in over four weeks kind of yellow they said that they cannot sell any paint but we can buy it online and then pick it up in the store so that is so silly what so looking how long does it take for it to come in earth well it's very they just can't like be handling it back and forth with you I don't know why all right this is brought these are pretty yellow this is too yellow straight-up yellow yellow these are more brownies these are pretty do two more my vibes okay let's see I like this color a lot these two movies mm-hmm the first one I picked up yeah I'm leaning towards one of these this one I like but you as you can tell like compared to this one these are a little bit more yellow right you're just doing a little design key show me what you're doing I did show you someone does this attention the entire wall the entire wall okay our stores are currently experiencing higher than normal volume we'll e-mail you when it's ready for pickup you want me to go in and ask them London when I put in the order online oh no no we can just go to Panera while we wait well I don't know how long it's gonna be maybe I don't know if it's gonna be like 10 minutes or if it's gonna be an hour or you did the color already you told them to call I know they had it when you go pick it up that doesn't make any sense very strange times very strange things why you watching my story I'm out here everyone said they want to be it's meant to hurt you want to help me film that tomorrow sure or do you want to do you want me to film you since it's your space it's your men this looks so fun this is so warm it's really fuzzy means you probably shouldn't do it well I'm putting the car here meaty hard it's fuzzy I told you no but your arms are huge no that's fuzzy no there's another instrument mister cumference fuzziness mm-hmm all right just when you are then are you gonna give them a call before just or should I just give him a call and ask   yeah it's pretty Orange well Oh get dry darker right yeah okay all right so I made a little chat away um after you're done right yes this isn't for me to stencil but more of like a guide of the spacing and it's not meant to be perfect like if I wanted it perfect I would have just done wallpaper you know so I do want it to be like imperfectly perfect and more organic so this is the guide I'm gonna follow we do the whole entire why are you freaking out it's not that big of a deal what are you gonna tell yourself it's not a follow me fantasy shoot now you freaking you know it doesn't have to be perfect remember so kids I would do all of it what you'd rather do all that same stroke but they go back and do the sit dealer they're doing the same stroke over and over and over the amount of work has to go back   okay so this is a lot tougher than we had anticipated so we brought out this plant because this plant is gonna be here in the nursery but it worked out really well because the first line that we did wasn't our best work but we figured out the strategy and that basically is to use the stencil but like actually use it so what we're doing is replacing it and then we're doing the lines right above it so that way we know exactly how far to come down and then we have this spacing correct every time and the spacing between each one is correct so what looks nice is having like the even space between each thing of cloth if that makes sense so so far so that we're correcting ourselves and I think it's gonna look really good and I really like the color it's drying it we got the eggshell but it looks kind of matte it like doesn't dry shiny and it dries a little bit darker so it's more of a brown not so orange II so       a Fiat with what happened to your hair elite just woke up from her nap and things are looking pretty pretty cray cray over here oh she had goldfish in there more more how do you say more in sign language how you do more put the ball down put you know looking at basement it's gotten two coats of primer two coats of paint she sees me chewing nice all the time because I love ice if you like them yeah Melanie literally just started doing sign language with her today and she's already learned can you show me more form yes I knew I knew it please thank you thank you yeah sure yeah good please Toki what does a tree look like there's a cheese look like oh yeah are you a tree please your bellybutton alright guys I just finished look how stinking cute it looks so honestly I think the secret was to just using the stencil because then they're not perfect like if you look up closely you can see that they all have like slight imperfections but that was kind of the goal with it I wanted it to be like organic looking and then the first run that we did it's totally Frank because that is gonna cover it so it's not even that big of a deal but I am so stinking happy with the way that it looks so this ledge is staying here because I'm gonna put artwork and cute pieces on top of the ledge just like I had before but it's gonna be more boyish more green and then the daybed will go right here so essentially basically the whole bottom half will be covered and you know mainly just see the top half but my sister and I will work on those art pieces at some point this week or the next week or whenever obviously I'll vlog that too but yeah I will write down the paint color for you guys if you want to know and if you're curious about it as well as linking this plant and let me know if you want me to link anything else that shelf is actually from Ikea it's two shelves that I put together so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this vlog it was a very therapeutic very fun very enjoyable to paint I always forget how much I like to paint because I don't really ever get to do it but I enjoy it a lot so hopefully this inspires you guys I really really am so happy thank you and I will leave my link to thrive it down below - if you guys want to try it out but that is going to be all for today's vlog thank you guys so much for watching I love you so much and I will see you in my next video bye sorry brother utrom hey where are you Oh Cheers I read another matches all right guys we are doing a basement today so our pizza is actually the only space of our house and is like fully furnished and ready and decorated and the reason Jordi is here is because this is his his little space he's the one that created it well you gotta know the reason why I wanted to really maximize the space down here is because in our old house we did not have a basement we didn't even have a crawlspace we just had a slab so it was one story just that was it now since we have a basement I'm like I really want to make this feel like an extension of the home like were just coming down here to work to hang out have family over whatever it just really enjoy the space as like an extension of our home so I got with a good friend of mine named Zeff and thank you uncle's F for making this all happen he was our contractor who basically took our vision from paper to reality and what I really love and appreciate about him is he was basically down to do whatever we wanted him to do we would say can you do this can you do that he'd say yeah I can make it make it happen so he also had some great suggestions and things that we didn't even think about that I'll point out to you along the way but yeah it's just really cool to have this experience to kind of design and see something come to life and have fun with it yeah so Jordan did the full layout of everything that you'll see down here like the sides of the bedroom size of the bathroom like the hallway spacing all of that was Jordan I helped him with his design because he had 15 different designs he wanted to accomplish and it was his theme was jungle bohemian I'm not decor yes yes yeah what was it bohemian gumball Southwest Industrial Toho chuckle Egyptian modern so that I helped him with like the decorative stuff so layout was Jordy if you think I'm serious here you have no sense making breakfast yes you are so serious I will try my best to link everything down below but we did buy a lot of the decor from home goods and as you guys know like they have stuff like in and out all the time it's not like linkable things I'll try my best like link similar things for you guys but that was like one way that we kept the costs tablets like shopping you can plan it if you see something you really would want to get but they don't have they have so many things that are very similar it's not exactly the same alrighty let's go on with the tool so first thing over here is my mom and I suggested to Jordan that he put a full-length mirror just because it's like this awkward hallway space so this is what you see when you come directly down the stairs so we thought it would be a good idea to open up the space with having a big mirror and just putting like a plant and just making you be able to see the rest of the basement also in that bedroom over there that is the only source of light we have coming in so it was good because it came in through here and then you can kind of see it through the mirror so it just brings in more light in this space so before I show you the bedroom I did want to point this out real quick originally the wall came all the way down to here and one of the things our contractor said was you probably want to open up this space a little bit and put a railing that would make it feel more open and not as closed in and I didn't even think of that so that was a genius idea from him so we put this railing in and I think it really looks great it kind of matches the same one we have upstairs going to our top floor but yeah it looks great and they did a really good job so this is the bedroom and it is a completely to code bedroom so if we for like resale or whatever later down the road we can count this as a bedroom because it has an egress window smoke and carbon monoxide detector in a closet so that was a win we wanted to make sure we did that down here to have people stay with us and friends and family and all that come over and just another space to be mm-hmm then we have my favorite bathroom of the house because of the title I love this house always wanted this tile you guys know this is like super trendy but Jordan did a good job with everything just keeping it very clean and white and then gold and black pieces is at the accent and it's good now the main space so we really wanted it to be functional so both being workspace hangout space bar a little bit more workspace but right here we just have two little desks for work stuff so it could be for us for work or it can be for our kids when they're a little bit older and have like schoolwork and stuff like Molina said we work down here we do phone calls conference calls talked with brands and all that so just nice to have a little separate space that's not like your kitchen table or your bedroom like it's good - I'm with Molina and separating as much as possible you're working your life especially when you're doing a lot at home just good for mental sanity then moving along this way this is my favorite part of the basement it is the two key bar as it's been nicknamed and you'll notice we have some kind of flirting built in shelves here the cool thing about these I told Zeff we wanted thick floating shelves right now it's Molina's request and he said well we got have 10 feet of finished space from wall to wall but he can only get the shelves an eight-foot measurement and he said well what I can do is build you to kind of shelves on either side those little built-ins and those will be a 1 foot each so it brings the space in to match perfectly with the size of the shelves we say great that looks nice it kind of breaks it up gives it some character matches the same color as the cabinet's underneath and what Zef been did was we wanted it truly flirting and he said we had to put something in the middle to support the weight so he put this steel L beam in and he actually had to glue to each one of those shelves are two pieces glued together with a little gap in the middle so the album kind of slides right in and then it goes down to the stud and then he had to drywall back over the stud kind of patch and paint it yeah I think it's right out really nice and we kind of wanted to go with the we don't want let the glass back and have it really dark we wanted to keep it as open and bright as possible just a little pop of color but the blue thing yeah so the blue was something that Jordan had wanted from the very start so this shelving matches the book shelving and this was something that he's really wanted this I feel like this was like the main focal point in the main thing that we built the rest of the basement apartment so like that color is like the color that we went off with for the rest so this is like just the areas that would be called family I don't know see the area these matches the barstools over there and then that little so far right there is actually a pullout bed twin screen that you see when yes folds out into a bed again I'm thinking the families over we have three four or five kids running around plus whoever else has kids that are staying with us and we need place to put people we don't want put our family up in hotels and all that so yeah it's just nice and cozy it's from article I have wanted this couch for as long as I can remember she's a beaut and then I have my noodle cow is she's so cute I feel like she perfectly matches this space I found her at Target I think it's about yeah she's not a cow she's a male because it has the horns oh right he is he'll cute what's his name um Alfred it looks like yeah oh one other thing I wanted to show you here so if you notice kind of how the ceiling does this thing I've never not really yeah okay so what come on come around this way so I can kind of show you the ceiling drops down about a foot right here this is I'm about 511 so this is probably like six six or so six five maybe six seven somewhere on there six Nephi and I regret not getting the taller ceilings they gave us the eight foot then we could have done a nine-foot ceiling but it was like a lot more money but now I kind of wish we did it because we would have had more head space but I think that's good but what I wanted to mention was they originally continued this all the way along because what's boxed in here is our HVAC like our air ducts and all that in our water lines so they boxed all this in but they had to drop the ceiling in order to do that so originally they had it going straight across and I said what can we kind of hug it along the side here because all the lines just kind of go right here anyways and they said yeah there's no problem because I wanted to do kind of this built-in area over here and they were able to do it and it kind of fit perfectly there so they just built these shelves later with the finished carpentry and I still have to hide these cables so don't look over here walkers all the decor that is up here is from home goods my mom and I went one day and they hide everything that we could possibly think of and then we just spent a couple of hours like rearranging and putting everything together now Jordan does have a lot of books now for a guy who has a lot of books you don't read a lot of books because why his books or all the other because I read them all four times I was telling Jordan in the three years we've been married I have not seen him read a single book besides the Bible keywords seen but I did have to read a lot when I was in the Academy and for grad school so I was kind of like booked out for a little bit and I'm not the kind of guy like reads for pleasure you know like if I'm reading I want to get something the point is that these books are just for looks like we're not actually like looking for these books says moley this is why they are facing the other way hold on hold on that was all just a big cover a big coup from Elena to justify why she's turned all of my books great orange bright red break perfect god forbid we have any color in our lives ever okay why seen this design I seen someone do this on Pinterest and I fell in love with it because I feel like it just looked so clean so it honestly took me a very long time to do this because I had to go through all the books and find which books were the same size which books went good like it was a lot of work and he was like you know it's gonna be more work trying to find the how can I read that one I can't see them but before that you didn't read all the Bible's are shown and you can see so that's all you need anyway now you're clear look at all these Bibles are the only ones that haven't confessed oh you're good you're good with God now if you place the Bible's aren't flipped around okay very cute so let's get Lissette really yeah okay great so everything you need to see anyways this is all just for looks nobody's using those specially not the Bible's just for luck just for show so yeah this was I feel like this is a main focal point of this space because of the books and just how much wall space this takes up and because of the color but you will link that color down below for you guys and then this dog bag I ordered to go upstairs but I do like the way it looks in our living room but it like matches perfectly down here and the dog and never sit on it so I don't know why we even have it they do they do sit there okay okay witnessed it alright and then the last part is where we record two podcasts so we wanted a table and we still don't know if we're gonna the table going long waits like this because we just I don't know it's an oval-shaped so we're still gonna play around with it because we do want to record our podcasts and put them up on YouTube for you guys to see if you're curious about how we record our podcast and all behind the scenes I'll link a video up here for you guys if you're curious that shows you guys like all the equipment that we have in all of that but we're still deciding whether we should flip it or not and then we got this really cool neon sign that says X from you at my house so this is where we do all the podcasting stuff mainly prepping everything as well the reason we have the table this way is because originally we're going to put a camera cut it over in this space and for the illusion of depth perception on film it wouldn't look better to do it this way because if we were to turn it that way it would look better in person but it would look kind of funny on camera because we'd be so far away from each other yeah we'll have to play around I feel like just for the aesthetic of the space it would make more sense for it to go this way to give it more of an open look but all right guys well that is the finished basement tour when we are building this house literally every time we would come to the site Jordan would drag me down here like literally every time for every week I mean she did that she did that to everyone right did he do that yeah so I'm just very happy and proud that he was able to finish it and get it a few days ago - like honey you're just like manifested the basement he's so good manifesting I'm like yeah I just I like spoken into existence and it just became my reality that only works for business don't try that with you okay that's it thank you guys for watching love you guys we'll see you in my next video bye hey guys welcome to today's video I thought we would do something a little different pregnancy-related because I'm willing to be pregnant for two more months which is crazy because this pregnancy has literally just flown by but as I've gotten pregnant this is my second pregnancy I've noticed so many things happen to my body that I'm like dude this is crazy and I feel like most women don't know that this happens or maybe my body is just really weird and does weird things when I'm pregnant I don't know but either way I was like I feel like I should make a video about this to warn women of what's gonna happen but also like let them know like your body is so stinking cool like look what it's doing right now as it's wearing a human is so I'm gonna sweat it kind of into two categories first I'll do like my personal experiences and some weird things that I've seen my body do and then I'll go into kind of like the more really cool things that your body doesn't change does that happen to accommodate for pregnancy in to grow a human so I hope this video is entertaining to you guys if you're currently pregnant congratulations that is so stinking excited I hope your pregnancy is going well if you're not pregnant this is just really good stuff to know because you'll be fully prepared and aware because there's so many things that I was like am i dying right now like there are so many things that I did not know was gonna happen and when it did I was like freaked out so hopefully this will it just give you some little inside scoop of that because I feel like I've talked to so many of my girlfriends or just like in casual conversation of like mentioned something and they're so confused and they're like wait that happens when you get pregnant I'm like no in the yeah it's just it's really cool so I thought this video would be really fun and just entertaining to share with you guys it is a little personal things that happened to me so don't judge me okay don't judge what my body does but it's packing it it's just what it does you guys want more pregnancy videos and make sure to give this video a thumbs up so I know you want more of those I only got two more months of this so I better milk it and just pump out as much pregnancy stuff as I can while I'm still pregnant if you are new here and you're not already subscribed make sure to subscribe down below before we get started you can't tell but my nose is runny I don't know why I feel like I'm starting to get allergies all right let's go ahead and get started first I'll show you like weird things that I've noticed that have happened with my body in particular when I get pregnant like I said this is my second pregnancy I had a girl the first time Alessia and then this time I'm having a boy and I haven't really noticed them being like drastically different because of like genders but they are slightly different but there's still a couple things that have happened that like have happened with both of them first thing that has happened that was honestly probably one of the strangest things is that my back gets very hairy when I'm pregnant and this is so strange and like I'm not sure why this happens overall I kind of get hairier like my hair grows like crazy my nails girl like crazy my toenails get really long but just the weirdest thing is my back it's super hairy now I feel like I don't really have hair on my back but like peach fuzz not anything that's like noticeable you know like your arms have hair on that your legs have hair like just like normal hair but like when I get pregnant it's like long and dark and like a noticeable I'm not gonna show you because sorry don't want to hear it but that is one thing that I've noticed happened with my first pregnancy it's happening again now and it is just so stinking weird but my back gets hairy when i pregnant so hmm love that for me another thing that gets hairier but this is a plus is my eyelashes get SuperDuper long I've noticed they get really fluffy they get really fanned out like I need time I'm pregnant I always get questions about my eyelashes and it's just pregnancy I don't know what it is but my lashes just literally will double in size they get really full really fluffy really lengthy just look fat ulis but then when I'm not pregnant and they go back to normal and they get sad and it's all all downhill from there another thing that happens and this is something that no one would really know unless they see me naked but like literally no one sees me they can't except for my husband so um this one is my breast so they obviously get larger that's like a very common thing but more specifically my nipples get really dark and I'm not sure if this happens with everyone but my doctor did tell me it is common for them to get darker and largers that happened with both my pregnancies and when I was best feeding to they stayed very large and dark and my doctor is telling me that reason that happens is because when the baby is born they have very blurry vision and I can't see really well and so they get darker and larger so the baby can easily see them and spot it in feed so I think that is so stinking cool I don't mind like I said no one really sees that anyway so it's honestly not that big of a deal but it is different like it doesn't look like one what it once you still look like since we're already kind of talking about the girls I thought I'd point out that for me I get super veiny I'm not even sure if it's gonna show on camera but I'm not trying to flash you but I get so meanie you might not be able to see because I have self-tanner on but I have these two veins right here like they go down like this and then they turn into two other veins and they're so distinct and so green and you can see them so perfectly and like when I make it like you can see exactly where they go on to liking my milk ducts and it's so sneakin strange and soap a minute this did go away after I stopped breastfeeding but I think I'm pregnant again and then it came back so I know it is common because you just have a lot of blood flow a lot of stuff going on that that is like one thing that for me I have very like prominent boobie veins when I'm pregnant another plus that happens is my lips get super swollen and it literally will look like I have just gotten injections and like got my lips done when pregnant with my daughter they were so stinking swollen that it was like kind of uncomfortable to talk like they were very small this time around my lips having gotten nearly as swollen as I did with my daughter but they do get larger and I've seen some people be like why are you getting your lips done when you're pregnant I'm like honey I ain't got nothing done that is all natural but it is something that does happen that is a good thing no I've noticed but with my pregnancies weird things happen at night I don't know what it is about nighttime nighttime rolls around and things start to get kind of weird both in the sense of like what my body does but also like things that happen at night so for a couple of weeks I get really itchy at night like just at night like uncontrollable itchy it doesn't do that anymore I did talk to my doctor she wasn't concerned about it because it's gone away now but there is there is a name for that and it is a disease that only happens to pregnant women that your liver lets go of some type of hormone that makes you really itchy I don't know a hundred percent but I don't that doesn't happen anymore but it did also I would get growing pains at night I don't know if you guys remember when you were like 10 and you get growing pains I get growing pains in my legs and it's just like I don't know how else to describe it if you've ever had growing pains you know what I'm talking about but other than that I don't know how else to describe growing pains other than growing pains like it's just like very uncomfortable and your legs like they feel like they're growing you kind of get like restless leg and you don't really want like everything is kind of uncomfortable and it's just like you're just like you're a bull you're just like no I don't like it and they're just like is annoying so for me I was like at night I'm just like very uncomfortable very irritable I feel like I get hot so easily um but for the sex life and that stuff um with my first pregnancy I noticed that things were just so much better I don't know what it is but there I did look it up and they said that because you have more blood flow there's like things are just better down there so like orgasms feel better everything just kind of feels better because of that so that I have one with my first pregnancy this pregnancy that hasn't been the case I don't know why but like my sex drive has it and I talked about this in my first and second trimester recap video so I'll link that down below if you guys want to see it but yeah that was like one thing with my first pregnancy I noticed was like sex was so much better this time I mean it's not it doesn't feel any different or any it feels more uncomfortable this time around I don't know if it's because I'm bigger or just like my irritability sorry honey I don't know it's just a different this time around so that hasn't been the case but that can't be a plus really these things can feel a little bit better down there so okay and last thing that happens to me that it's kind of strange is my armpits get really dark and I don't know if you'll be able to see this on camera so I just shaved yesterday so there is no hair there but my actual like skin will get dark and it will look like I haven't shaved in like three weeks even though I like just shaved I don't know if it's good the camera is gonna pick it up I can't really tell my uh it's not really good actually I have this new deodorant that I really like it's on the outro by the way but it smells really good so yeah I don't know if you can see on camera but in real life they get really dark and I'm not sure why that happens just like the pigmentation the pigmentation of that gets dark and I also get freckles when I'm pregnant so I love freckles I've always wished I had freckles I think they're so stinking cute and when I get right now I get freckles I get tons of little spots there's a name for it starts with an M I can't remember what it is but it's common for pregnancy for that to happen because of all your hormones and everything everything basically just boils down to your hormones changing and like different things going on but you do get cute little freckles and little things under your eyes I'm not bothered by it because I think it like looks cute it's just kind of drastic like I noticed it a couple of days ago and I was like whoa where the heck did all these little spots come from um again I'm not bothered by it and it did go away with my first pregnancy and they just started to come back now so I'm assuming the whole way with this pregnant we'll see again it doesn't bother me so I don't really care if it stays or goes do as you please skin alright so those were like the strange things that have happened to me personally but I thought I would share like a couple of other things that like statistically and like with research and data of like what happens to your body when you're pregnant so because of all of the hormones and everything everything starts to grow so your hair skin nails you get that glowy skin you have a huge increase of blood so your blood increases by 50% which is wild I think that is crazy that is so much stinking blood and the reason for that is I mean have you seen this picture of a placenta that placenta is like a whole chunk of blood like that thing is nasty it's just like a blood pumping thing and it's actually an organ which I didn't know it was an organ but the placenta I guess is an organ so your blood just increases by crazy so that's why you have like the more puffy look you have more of the glowy look things are just growing things are just your body is doing a lap lots going on up and down in your body that is causing everything to grow in addition to that not only does like your tummy get bigger like obviously we know but also your ribs and your hips so your ligaments loosen up when you're pregnant and this is something that I'm currently having pain with so my like pelvic area has been hurting it so badly recently like comes and goes but your everything is kind of loosening up to prepare for birth to prepare your hips to expand and because of that things just get larger I mean you're gonna have a baby come through so things need to kind of move and flow a little bit easier so for me my ribs have gotten larger they didn't go back and my hips got wider and they didn't go back after pregnancy I don't know that it ever well I don't really mind because it makes me look more curvy and I think that's great so no complaints for me on that part another thing is that your intestines move around your stomach gets pushed all the way up here which is so strange so for me I like don't really get hungry when I'm pregnant because of the discomfort Allah I feel like I just I don't know like I want to eat something like I want a burger so bad and I'll just crave it and I'll crave the fries I'll crave it all and then when it comes to actually eating it I'll take a couple of bites and I'm like I'm done in full I don't know what it is but like everything is smushed so there's like no room for any of that so I feel like that's kind of why I don't end up eating all that much but I think it's really interesting how just like all your intestines move around and everything just like makes a room for the little baby to grow another thing is that your heart rate you have an increased respiratory rate which you can probably tell I'm always out of breath I feel like a lot of pregnant women are always out of breath like for me going up half the step I'm already out of breath your body just has so much more to like do and certainly and go through that you just get out of breath really easily this is something I really struggle with like my workouts I'm wheezing when I am working out like I have to really take it slow and take it easy but that is something that you'll see and notice and because like the baby if you're carrying high it's like in your ribs so naturally like you just will have a really hard time breathing because of all of that and then the last thing that I think is super interesting it's called the pregnancy line I didn't get it with this pregnancy but it's basically a line that you get that goes right down your tummy like this and I had it with my first pregnancy and it was just right here just like became a dark little thing I don't have it with this one but it is something that a lot of women do get and then sometimes it doesn't even go away after you give birth um so yeah that's strange but since we're talking about this are we talking about my belly button my belly wanting does the weirdest things when I'm pregnant my first pregnancy my belly like became an outie it very soon this time around my belly looks like it's gonna fall off like it's so weird my daughter lust pick up my belly and like try to pull it off it's very sensitive to the touch like it hurts when you touch my belly button I don't know why but it just my belly has looked very different between my first and second pregnancies so those are all the strange things that I have noticed that happened to my body when I'm pregnant this doesn't mean it's gonna happen to yours it's mum just sharing what's happened with mine everybody the body is different even though we're going through same things like I don't learn - you're gonna have a hairy back like I do you might have really long toenails instead I don't know there's like certain things that everyone's body will do during pregnancy that is a little bit weird a little bit strange but overall I feel like it's so beautiful in the way that God created our bodies is amazing so hope you guys enjoyed this video hopefully it gives you a little inside scoop of what might happen I love you guys let me know any other video ideas you'd like to see I already did baby news that we like but won't be using videos so I'll link that down below I did a basement tour a couple of days ago I did like catch up on my videos that we have at VidCon oh because I've been pumping out stuff for you guys and the nursery - which were so stinking excited to start and finally like have a grasp on so I'll link that down below as well but I love you guys and I will see you in my next video well hello guys good morning welcome back to today's video I'm so stinking excited about it because I have such a passion for this I don't know why but I just love to clean I love a clean house I love a clean environment most of us are working from home right now so I feel like this video is so timely if you have a clean house I guarantee your mind will be cleared you'll just function so much better you'll feel so good so I've always lived like this and I'm just gonna share with you guys my hacks and my secrets and my tips of little things that I do throughout the entire day that make the biggest difference with keeping my house clean now I was always told that when I have a kid like my house is gonna be so gross like I remember getting comments like that all the time of people being like well good luck keeping a clean house at the baby and when people told me that I saw it as a challenge and the challenge was accept it and I'll tell you this my house is probably even cleaner now that I have a baby because I'm more on top of things because she's crawling she puts things in her mouth and I always like want to make sure things are clean so I'm gonna show you guys some couple of hacks so Alethea sleeps with her bottle and I will take her bottle when I get her out of her bed and I will put it by the stairs now I do this with basically anything that needs to go downstairs when I'm upstairs so that when I do go downstairs I bring up everything that needs to go down I do this with the stairs as well so quick little hack right there but first thing I encourage everyone to do is to make their bed oh please make your bed I promise you it's not a waste of time and it feels so good to get into nice sheets so first of all I always chase around Sam Soon for like five minutes because he's very lazy and never wants to get off the bed so I can do it but I always like to give my bed a nice air out a nice little fan to kind of let my bed breathe because you sweat and let see things out when you're sleeping so I always like to just air it out for a second and then I'll start making it we wash your sheets once a week and we try our best to keep our dogs as clean as possible because they sleep with us sometimes so that is just my biggest hack for you guys too is to just regularly clean your sheets don't wait until they're all nasty and gross to like actually clean it because you right after that I will do a quick cleanup so lay Theo would have already gone into her playroom when I was making my bed yada yada yeah but I'll do a quick clean up all upstairs before I head downstairs to make sure that things are good so next hack for you guys are your dishes get on a routine with your dishes I highly suggest you guys put your dishwasher to wash only at night the reason for that is because first thing in the morning you can put everything away and then your dishwasher is clear all day and there's no excuses as to why you can't put your dishes directly into the dishwasher there's no excuse as to why it should be piling up so Alethea's battles normally we'll leave them to dry overnight so I'll first put everything that needs to be put away anything that was like drying overnight I'll put that stuff away first then I will head to the dishwasher and unload it so I normally unload it in categories I don't know if everyone does this but this is just like how my brain works so I'll grab my new utensils all of the utensils and put them away at once then I'll grab like all the knives anything that's sharp and I'll put all of those away at once and then I'll put like forks spoons knives whatever everything that's left I'll put those away at the same time I don't know if everyone does this like I said but for me it saves me so much time because it takes me probably three to four minutes to unload our dishwasher completely which is honestly kind of fast so all of our plates I'll take them all out once all of our cups I'll take them all at once so I'm not having to like go back and forth and redo the same thing 15 million times if that makes sense all right now I'm to cooking so cooking is obviously when the kitchen gets the dirtiest because there's so many things that you're doing and I love cooking so much but I really enjoy even more when I cook and clean as I'm going because then I can actually enjoy my food and not have to see the kitchen be like a big giant mess so as I get things I put them back so I got my olive oil and put it back I got my eggs I go and put them back and then after we're done eating put your dishes away I know this may sound super simple but I'm telling you these little things will make such a big difference and your dishwasher is all empty and ready for you to load it up so why not fill it up you know now with a baby I highly suggest you invest in some pieces and some things that are gonna make your life easier one being a bib that catches everything I'll link it down below I love it also a highchair that tray comes off our first highchair was little easy to trade did not come off and it was the biggest pain in the butt ever and we could never get it fully cleaned so I highly suggest a nice bib that catches things you could even get them they have like these shirts that they can wear that you can take everything off so I highly suggest you try something like that and then my recent addition that I have fall in love with is this clear plastic liner that I put underneath your highchair and it makes cleanup so easy because you can just wipe everything off and it's not on my rug it's not on my floor my dogs can quickly just eat all the food too and then right after we're done eating I will try my best to use only one pot when I'm cooking so only one pot or pan needs to be cleaned boom done simple and fast and then I will just do a quick cleanup downstairs so whatever was put away so blankets I feel like we always have out any dog toys any dog things I'll just quickly do a quick cleanup putting those away putting any toys away I highly suggest you have a home for everything when things have homes they have somewhere to go when they don't have somewhere to go they end up on the countertops and end up elsewhere so relay theist toys the dog toys I have tons of bins and stuff all around the house and I can just throw it inside of now for her playroom now this is the part of the house and I probably clean the most because it's used the most so her playroom always ends up looking like this and totally fine because I just let her play and then when she's done I go and quickly clean it up if you have older kids you need to teach them how to clean up their rooms like they need to learn how to clean up themselves because you can't be doing it but I try to show Lacey I try to teach her but you know that doesn't always work because she's won but still I wait until she's done playing to do that now for our bedroom the easiest way that it gets messy is when we change outfits you know girls we're super messy and and decisive and we'd love to just throw our clothes everywhere this is definitely something I do so my biggest tip is to one like kind of plan out your outfits beforehand and then when you get dressed put your PJs away or put them to wash like always put them away don't start piling things up on that one chair that we all have I know you have that chair and I know it's our tendency to want to throw things but just hang it back up and have a place for something like my hats I wear them a lot so I always make sure to have a place for them and now for laundry I'm telling you laundry used to be my most dreaded task because I always waited until we had 17 loads of it to do and then I would get super overwhelmed don't wait until you get to that point if you're gonna devote a lot a day to do laundry only do one load now why because then that way you can start and finish in that one day and it's done if you try to do like three loads at once you're gonna be folding and putting things away for so long and it becomes super tedious and annoying so make sure that you have enough time to wash dry and fold and put away and have fun with it like dance put some music on every baby's help you have your husband help you like have fun with it and then once you're done put the clothes away cuz that was my biggest thing I would actually do the laundry but then the laundry would just sit there and I never put it away so it's better when you do it frequently because then it's less and then you can easily just put things away and you don't have a pile of laundry just sitting there waiting to be put away next thing is vacuum I vacuum once a day and the reason for that is because I have two dogs and I have a baby that's walking crawling and loves to put dirt in her mouth so my biggest tip is to get a vacuum that is a lightweight it doesn't have to be the Dyson vacuum but I will say that I'm obsessed with it and I love it a lot it's cordless it's very easy and it's chargeable so I am able to vacuum the whole downstairs in less than five minutes and I do this just once a day boom bada boom bada boom pick up all the little dirt sand dust and never have anything sticking to my toes because that drives me bonkers when there's things stuck to my toes what's next what's next last thing is a deep clean routine so there's no point of having like things or put in place if you are covered in dirt and there's three layers of dusting that needs to be done try to stick to a routine where you do dusting and bathroom and like mopping it all of that I feel like twice a month is pretty good like every other week if you have more people or more stuff maybe once a week depends on what that is but whatever it is make a schedule and stick to it so that it's always like it's easy to upkeep and clean and whatnot but those are all my hacks for you guys I hope you enjoyed this video I had fun filming this again it's one of my passions so I'll link some stuff down below if you guys want any resources or like my favorite cleaning stuff and whatnot but if you guys enjoy cleaning happy quarantine and I'll see you in my next video hey guys happy Sunday is Sunday here for us so the first couple of clips that you guys just saw was me attempting to DIY and make my own hanging plant sorry I'm just turning up the brightness just a little bit but it was a complete failure and when Jordan with the hanging up my plant was so heavy that it like completely fell apart so that was a great waste of 45 minutes because it took me 45 minutes to do that I'll stick to painting I'm better at doing that than anything else but having such an itch to redecorate and like rearrange stuff in the house obviously right now you can't really do any shopping online shopping for like home decor is so hard to do and so expensive I think the first thing we're gonna do once I'm out of quarantine besides see like all my friends and family is go to home goods because I love home goods so much and their stuff is so affordable and it drives me crazy like I've been looking for a black mirror to put in our bedroom and black mirrors at home good cost anywhere between 20 and 50 dollars like they're very affordable there they always are like the same price but online every mirror that I've been looking at is like $200 but I know I can get it at HomeGoods for so much cheaper so that's what I'm gonna do once quarantine is over comment down below let me know what you guys are gonna do like what store your first gonna go to cuz for me it's definitely home goods the past couple of days have been kind of rearranging everything in the house and like taking decor form and move one room and moving it to another room and then getting a couple of things putting it here putting it there and kind of like revamping everything so I would say guys that good I am going to do a gallery wall in my bedroom I've wanted to do this for a while now but I finally figured out like how to do it so chris loves Julia is an account I follow on Instagram I'm obsessed with them they're great they do like interior designing and they have a blog so they did a blog post a couple of days ago on how to do like portraits and how to get prints and stuff and they gave me the best hack ever and that is to go on to like different websites of museums so I'll link their blog down below so you guys can see it but I went on to the Smithsonian's website and they basically have like this database that is completely free to the public where you can download the pictures and canvases in like displays that they have in the museum's for free and you can do whatever you want with it so I spent hours searching for different prints and different things to use and I finally found them and I printed them out and I'm gonna hang them up today and have a couple of other things I want to do as well but theythey just went down for her nap but once she wakes up I will show you guys her because she is talking so stinking much I think at this point she probably knows anywhere between 20 to 30 words that she just consistently says and girlfriend is reading she's reading now I swear to you she can read now she reads mom and dad I know it's not that much but still she knows the difference between the two and she can find them she'll say them it's so stinky cute so whenever she wakes up I'll show you guys that but let them go put up those frames and I'll show you them too okay so here are some of the pictures that I got I wanted something kind of moody and more like discreet how stinking beautiful this is this one I got this lady I think I might make her even bigger into a poster so she can fit on that really large frame I don't know yet I got this guy and then these flowers   okay so this this is my original inspo photo I loved how they had done a gallery wall in a corner I'd like literally never seen that before and I have this corner of my room where I have a corner and at first Wow ever I had two pieces over there and it just is very bland so we're gonna do these three pieces so this is what they look like with the frames on them this right here is gonna go on this wall right there and then we did another set with these four which I'm obsessed with and this whole set is gonna go straight onto this wall so like when you walk in that's like basically what you'll see I love how like dark and vampy this one is I'm obsessed with this guy and how he looks with the frame and same with that little village and then I really love these two flowers I think they're so pretty and then I just love her too she's so cute she's got a cute profile so I'm gonna make her bigger but I'll try my best to find these exact ones for you guys if you like are curious and want to do it too oh my goodness look who's awake and so busy guys she's so stinking busy I can't she's always doing something let's not play with that this sharp tips do you want to go read I'll go do some readings yeah it's going to play vroom do some weeding he's watching let's go read so basically what you do is you'll get yeah okay so basically what you'll do is you'll get some yellow paper cuz yellow is very easy to see and spot and then with black Sharpie write the names so for her first book is what we call it we have her name in it and we have mom and dad written so anemia so she actually doesn't know her name she has a hard time saying her name obviously because it's kind of hard thank you what's his name what voices sake duh what's this one thing this one mama mama what's this one say daddy right Alethea where's this Day weekend what is this one say mum mum mah what about this one Oh yell again Oh what is this a dad this one yeah go back this time the guy again mad bad day with us a mother wait a second oh it's this one thing she tried to say away Thea she said something yeah catch tattoos ordinary guy ordinary guy she tried to say lethea sounded it sounded like blue flower so she has a lot of fun with this it's really easy to introduce you just do it over and over again and then she'll just catch on and I know it's only two words but still she knows the difference between mom and dad at least which is huge like I was showing you I have tons of other ones in here too but these are all words that she currently says so any word that she knows we made it into a flashcard and then i'm slowly gonna introduce word by word just so she doesn't get confused and overwhelmed all at once but first she's been doing really good okay i also completely forgot but I'm one step closer to finishing my office down here so what's been so these frames were actually upstairs in the nursery that's gonna be for baby boy i repainted a couple of them and i added and made some new ones so Jordan just hung a mess up for me yesterday and I still need to order some coffee books and put like more stuff down there but this is what it's looking like so far and I am obsessed and I saved so much money for like painting it myself and it was so stinking easy to make those prints use me where you go where you go babe and one little fun project that I'm gonna do with her tonight is I have so right there I have a little picture of her foot and I had two other pictures there as well but for some reason they like weren't hanging properly so I'm gonna make another canvas but I'm actually gonna have her finger print our finger paint I'm going I'm gonna get colors like that are the same of the colors that are already over in that area and then I'm just gonna put her in her diaper and just put the fingers or the paint on her fingers and let her like paint on the canvas and whatever she comes up with I will hang up there so that will be like her little corner because I have her foot and then I'll do that but wait look at her right now she's she's carrying that soap up the stairs you're I need seventh or eighth outfit change of the day aren't you what she keeps saying that guys and they have no idea what she's even trying to say but she is speaking so much by twos you talk so much now don't you let's go see Mama's room so we can see what grandpa did okay I'm putting it on me so I can get my reaction oh why I didn't even feel my face wow that looks so good that is like exactly what I wanted oh I'm so excited this is what you see like right when you walk in wow I love the colors I love how moody it is I love how like unexpected it is like I would never really do something like this you know but I wanted to try something new and something different so that's what it looks like with the rest of the room so we did just recently change I changed out a couple of things and revamped it a little bit wow I like it a lot and then over here I changed out a couple of things too so I will be doing a room tour very soon because now it's done oh my gosh cuz I'm so excited I literally spent like not even $15 to do all of this and normally one of those would cost like $200 so I'm so stinking excited Wow I'm so happy right now I was a little scared it was gonna look kind of strange cuz like portraits of like random people you know but I love it oh someone is good do my stop where you gonna go oh you want to read some more why me my baby oh you would Bob mm-hmm in your morning did Bob they are the cutest thing together ever every morning Alethea the first thing that comes out of her mouth is either Wow Wow sore Bob and she wants to see him and they'll spend a good five minutes just obsessing with each other and it's so sweet you give him a bedroom you get Bubba beige oh no you guys have probably noticed but it's the next day it's the next morning it's like 7:30 right now so Jordan actually started a new job today so this has been his dream job for the past three years and he got the job and I'm so stinking proud of him and he starts at today me me so it feels so weird not having Jordan with us in the mornings but I'm excited because then I'll get to miss him Oh like bead Oh like wheat how things were before so he worked with me for about four months and we really enjoyed that time like we were able to get a lot of it but it is a lot at the same time to work with your spouse so I'm excited for him to go back to work and have his job his dream job so very stinking proud of him but for that Hey well nothing you do Danielle did you mind go eat some breakfast she loves to rearrange her makeup every morning I'm going to my vitamins before I forget so since Jordan has been home I am the worst at remembering to take my vitamins more so in the morning because I prefer to take them in the morning but I am the worst with remembering to do that and Jordan normally does it for me so I made sure to set an alarm on my phone around the time that I normally eat breakfast so I don't forget to take them but Cara is working on today's video with me so thank you to them I been taking their vitamins for the past two years I took it with my pregnancy with ilithyia around that time was when I first started taking it it was my prenatal it's my prenatal for this one as well and I absolutely loved it I've raved about it to so many of you and so many of you have tried it and have loved it as well so my favorite thing about it is how convenient it is and how it's custom-made just for you so if you go into the care of website you can take a short little quiz it's like five minutes and letting them know what it is that you would like to work on so for me I put in that I was pregnant I do normally have anemia so they put in extra iron for me I have calcium fish oil I frequently change mine because of like my pregnancy and like all my complications and stuff so I'm always like retaking the quiz and like changing and altering certain things if you feel like you're not sleeping enough or if you feel like your nails are brittle and you want your hair to grow like you can put in certain things onto the quiz and then they'll make the vitamins just for you and my favorite thing is that they come in really cute little dispensers so you can keep this in your pantry you can keep this on your counter tab and then you just pull one out every day then it literally has your name on it and then I'll also have like a little challenge for the day so it says unscramble the word and then it has the word I don't know it has like cute little things that you can do every day and then all the vitamins that you need to take for that day are in the back so if you guys want to try this out I mean I feel like everyone right now really wants to get healthy and take care of themselves so I will leave a link down below where you guys can try it out for your first time for 50% off which i think is a great deal okay so I will link that down below for you guys but ten of the ten recommend used it for so stinking long I just like kind of suck at remembering to take it I'll take them but I want to be more routine about it I'd rather just take it in the morning and then not have to think about taking it for the rest of the day so I'm setting my alarm has held are you eaten job yet PC stop babies yeah so I just made us some oatmeal so for her she loves peanut butter so I do peanut butter and bananas and then the oatmeal and then for me I just have peanut butter and then I put brown sugar to sweeten it and he says yeah yeah I think I live or you hate with your spoon yeah mmm we just finished our breakfast and every morning I take ilithyia on a child's walk so I've talked to you guys about this at Instagram but basically it is just a walk where you let the child dictate where you go how long you go they pick out whatever they want to touch like I'll let her touch worms and dirt and mud I'll let her just like explore and she loves she loves the box so much so I got her these rain boots because even though it's not raining outside it's like the grass is kind of dewy so I've got her raincoat and rain boots and so that's what we use for the box and then I'll normally put a coat on her and if it's a little chillier I'll put on head and just layer her up but we go every single morning if it's raining will still go but just for like shorter periods of time but she really enjoys these walks she collects pebbles so he started a pebble jar with all of - these pebbles in it I'm normally just bring my coffee and just enjoy our walk and if I hear anything like the owls owls are always making noises or if we see an airplane or something I'll point it out and kind of help her but for the most part she's the one that is observing everything else so I highly suggest you guys try this the days that I don't walk her the days are worse if they're not as good I feel like she doesn't get her energy out I don't know what it is but she just gets so much energy out from walking and exploring and her little brain is working so highly since you guys try this out with your kids - but you here are the birdies let's see she's already explained she's ready grabbing stuff she's walking in the grass I let her walk on the grass that's fine she doesn't have to walk on the sidewalk but she'll just who are you going see that's why it's good to have the rain boots because there's still like some do in the grass so at least your foot won't get wet but now her butt's getting wet she's a brown hey do you need help   that is beautiful wow that is your masterpiece done look so good do you like it I love it alright guys miss Fuchs is all just for the day I still need to get myself dressed for the day so I'm going to end the vlog here I hope you guys enjoyed leave links to like her rainbow and her raincoat and that video if you guys are curious about it and let me know anything else that you guys would like for me to link I will also put my code for carob in description box as well but I love you guys thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you later this week bye hi guys good morning well it's probably not morning by the time you guys see this but hi its morning time for me I'm very excited because I'm in my office that I've never filmed inside of like this main purpose for this office was for me to always film ends I know but I never have because I haven't finished it and now that I have keep things hanging up on the wall and I have a little situation going here I'm very excited cuz now you guys will have something cute to stare at today's video is going to be my favorites during quarantine and like things that I have been using a lot more since we've been in quarantine and kind of been bringing me joy and helping me get through this I saw that Kristen to this video and I loved hers so I thought I would try it out a link her video down below as well I've actually never done a favorites video period ever so I'm excited about this because I have such like an array of things so I have everything between stuff that I use outdoors I have stuff for like aleisea I have like drinking things I have just like honestly it's a very random bunch of things that I have but these are all things that have really helped me and I've just been using a lot and loving so if you guys would like to see more like this if you want to see like Amazon favorites let me know you guys know I'm obsessed with the Amazon give this video a thumbs up if you are liking the background honestly I am gonna change this whole situation out these books are too small for this space but I can't find coffee table books anywhere especially online it's kind of hard and they're so expensive like a coffee table book the size that I want like really big ones are like 150 dollars and I just can't justify that so trying to figure out what to do about that but I also want to learn your face just like larger items because this is like a really large platform so the pictures are staying but this little situation I'll probably like end up rearranging but yeah all right if you're not already subscribed to my channel make sure to subscribe before you leave and let's get started with the video okay first thing I'm going to talk about is this because I need to take a step out of it but truly I love this thing so much and that is my Yeti Cup I always said is that I would not buy a Yeti Cup because I think they're so overpriced and I just cannot justify it but Jordan knows I've been wanting one and he went to the grocery store thing every day and they had 50% off all of Yeti things so he is able to get it for 15 bucks which i think is pretty reasonable so I really like this a lot like I'm telling you this holds my water and keeps it so cold if I put ice in this thing and go to bed the next morning my ice will still be in my cup like this thing it keeps everything really cold now the reason I've been liking this specifically during quarantine is because it's making me drink more water I have noticed that if I have this with me and I carry it around all day I'm more likely to drink it and then I'm more likely to refill it and then I find myself refilling this thing like three four times a day which is really good so I just feel so much better when I drink water I've struggled with migraines as you guys know and if I'm not drinking enough water that's a huge trigger point for me so just having this and just having it with me all the time has really helped and then this job didn't come with it Jordan actually got this straw from Meijer I believe but I've seen them on Amazon so I will link it down below 10 out of 10 recommend I also do actually have a dupe for the Eddy so if you're not able to find it on sale I'll link another one down below that I think is very comparable that I really enjoy since we're actually talking about drinks and the next thing we talk about is much up so never in a million years did I think I would get tired of coffee somehow did there was just like a point where I was like I don't really want coffee but I like needed the caffeine so I fell in love with matcha and I ordered this one from thrive it's by a company called matcha love I'll try to link this exact one down below but I really really liked it and then Jordan actually went got me a little much a kit thing so I will put hot water in here and then I add a scoop and a half of matcha and then you mix it up with this thing and then I make it iced so I add oat milk and ice and agave to it and it is so yummy I almost said stinking yummy but I'm not gonna stay stinking once in this video okay because a lot of you have been saying I say it too much and I don't even realize that I say it or when I'm editing I don't even hear it but I'm not gonna say it this video okay I'm not I'm gonna try really hard but I'm not gonna say it I'm my Instagram story I actually did show you guys how I make my machen if you guys watched it was really funny because I spilled it the matcha all over my counter and all over into my phone so um I'll save it as a highlight if you guys want to go see how I make it but yes love this a lot it taste so yummy and I feel like it's honestly probably better for you than coffee would be but I'm not a hundred percent sure about that okay next little genre so we did drinks now I'm going to move on to outdoor stuff for a second so I've been trying so hard to go outside and get fresh air I've been trying to go on walks with leafy I walk with my dogs just like be outside because we're stuck inside all day and in Michigan and honestly is still pretty cold it's like the weather is just all over the place there was like two weeks where we had like 60-degree weather it was beautiful sunshine every day and then we had snow and it was like in the 30s and windy and very cold so the weather is still kind of all over the place but when it is nice out I try my best to go outside currently I actually don't have our patio done we did a vlog about that couple weeks ago but that's not stopping me from going outside so what I do is I will create like a little picnic for us so I use my gather map I didn't bring it here to physically show it to you because it's really big and it's kind of dirty right now because like we use it outside but a gather mat is one of my favorite pieces ever so if you haven't heard of them they're a company on Instagram I found them like a couple years ago and basically it's just like a giant Nik blanket but it's made out of like vegan leather so it's very like very pretty but also very practical so I have the largest size and I will just lay it out in our front yard and we will just sit on it eat snacks on it I'll bring the link there's toys out there she'll play with her ball should look at the birds everytime we go to Florida I always bring it in my suitcase with me because I just like I just love it that much so I'll link it down below the exact one that I have in the color but the newest I've had that for a while and I've like raved about it before but the newest edition that I had to bring out to show you guys is this chair so this is technically like a lime chair but like the cutest version ever of a lawn chair so it actually goes like this are you are you crying right now because I am like this this is the cutest thing ever so it's a rattan lawn chair so you just lay this down like this and you just sit and they're like the back of it of just different links so you can lay back lay forward whatever it has this like little thing for your head I got two of these and I use it basically daily when we do a little picnics but it's very like very sturdy very durable um it even has like a strap on it so you can like hang it on your shoulder if you're gonna take it somewhere my original plan cuz I bought this before quarantine and I just like envisioned my family going on picnics with it and like going to the parks and having a newborn in my arms and like sitting outside with him and I don't know if that's even gonna happen which makes me sad but at least I can use it outside in my front yard so that's a plus trying to like be optimistic about this and be positive but I did have like certain expectations and like certain things that I wanted to do with new baby boy and like as a family of four but I don't know if those are gonna happen so anyway this is probably my favorite thing that I'm going to show you guys because it's just so practical and so cute and I use it a lot myself like if you are an outdoorsy person if you're constantly going outside like doing picnics like we always love going to festivals and anything that like has to do with outdoorsy you'll use that a lot so for us it was definitely worth it to get it last outdoorsy thing and these little boots so wit believe me we take her on morning walks and like I said the weather has been all over the place either it's raining snowing or if it's nice out the grass tends to be kind of light because of the dew and whatever so I have just loved these I found them on Amazon it's like the perfect height there's still a little bigger on her but I love this part because it's tall enough where like her ankles don't get wet but it's short enough where she can still bend her knees because some rain boots for kids are just way too long and it goes above her knee and then she can't even walk I love these she's played in the mud with them and I just take them into the sink rinse him off really quickly and boom done so I love these so much I also got her a raincoat which looks so cute cuz it's also a yellow says she's just like a little yellow be walking around in the mornings and it's really cute alrighty next little category let's call it my happy station or make happy things so like I said in the beginning of the video I've been trying my best to do things that bring me joy I try to do one thing a day that brings me joy and I know that may sound like super cheesy or super corny but I've been trying to like do things that make me happy and bring me joy because I feel like it's so easy to not do that and then just kind of get stuck on your phone or just like half time just go by so fast so that is something I've been trying to make like an extra effort to do so other that's take a bath do a face mask or it go for a walk exercise I've been trying really hard to work out more frequently not that I enjoy it cuz honestly like I really don't enjoy exercising especially right now because my tummy is so big I don't know what it is about this pregnancy but working out has been a little bit harder I get sore a lot faster and my like whole pelvic bone region like really hurts so I have to be very care about the exercises that I do so I haven't like I know oh I don't necessarily enjoy the workout but like I like how I feel after the workout so for me that makes it worth it so one thing when I've been doing that has brought me joy that I enjoy it to do duh it's painting so I have always loved painting but I don't really ever have a chance to like do it or have a reason to do it or inspiration or I don't know the time it can be kind of messy it can take a while so I have been trying to paint and that's how I painted all of these so I actually made all the artwork before this I had already had artwork done that I had made a couple months back but I like repainted over some of them and I made new ones and so this has just been something that I've been enjoying so I bought this paint at Hobby Lobby a while back I'll try to find it it's masters touch it's acrylic paint so I got I have like all Browns I have pinks White's you guys know the colors I like so for me this was just something that I liked and I was able to do without having to buy anything else because I already had canvases I already had pictures I already had all the supplies that I needed to get so I didn't have to like go to the store because I don't know that you'd be able to get paint right now so I can already did have that but that's something that makes me happy so if you're like into knitting and I know I kind of sound like a grandma but if you're into knitting or if you're into sewing I don't know like hey I don't know what else what other crafty stuff is there that people could do I feel like maybe knitting like a scarf or maybe even get into a new hobby I don't know try something new we have time on our hands now y'all so let's let's try something build a new happy alright next thing that I have been loving is this face mask by fresh this is like the best face mask in the entire world it's called the Lotus Youth preserve rescue mask and it's a seaweed mask and it's so cooling like I went and I wish you guys could smell it because it smells so clean and so fresh but this is what it looks like it's very cold but I like a cold facemask and it's very hydrating and your face will literally feel like a baby's butt when you're done so for me I love this guy I'll do it like once or twice a week I also take baths pretty frequently and yes you can take a bath when you're pregnant you just can't have like scalding hot water you can only have warm water but for me I've been trying to take baths at least like twice a week or just doing again doing something that brings me joy if that calms me down I try to read a book when I'm in there or I'll just like sit in silence I'll burn a candle and I'll just sit there and look at the ceiling but it's just so refreshing because I feel like I'm go go go all day that I never have silence and so that time of silence I can really just think and talk to the Lord and just kind of hear from him because like I said I feel like I'm just always so go-go-go so that has been something I guess I should have mentioned this one as well but another favorites of mine during quarantine has been my Bible because I've been waking up before lakeya which I always struggle with it's always a goal of mine to wake up before her and do my devotional but that doesn't always happen because sometimes her schedule is like inconsistent so I have been making an extra step towards that direction of making the time and setting my alarm even earlier than when I would suspect her to wake up early and just doing my devotional and just reading my Bible and it has been so nice because of daylight savings it's been light out when I wake up which has been really nice cuz it's so hard to get up when it's dark but it's been light out when I wake up so that has been really nice and just having my matcha or having my coffee reading my devotional reading my Bible and just like spending 15 minutes with the Lord before I start my day has really brought me joy and made things better so if you guys haven't tried out the Ruth study that I did it's absolutely free it's only seven days it's very short very simple I highly highly highly highly highly suggest you guys try it out just because it will be such a good push to getting you into setting that routine and setting the habit of spending time with the Lord so I should have basically started the video off with that note because I feel like it's just so good for you but yeah don't don't neglect your Jesus okay last thing are these blue light glasses now these are so cute first of all I actually bought these for my sister's so I got her these and white clear ones they came in like a pack of two and I promised to blue light glasses do make a difference for me at least the only thing is that I'm not used to wearing glasses so if I do wear these I have to make sure it's a short amount of time because or else I get a headache my mother is facetiming me and there's weight sorry my mom and I faced time at least three times a day anyone else really no okay so I love these because I feel like since quarantine is started I am spending a lot more time on my computer generally I spent a lot of time on my computer but I've been doing other projects and other things that consistently require me to be either on my computer or on my phone or just on a screen or watching TV like feel like we're always on screens so I love this because it helps with the blue light blacking which is apparently bad and I think it's cute honestly the whole cute thing is probably why I use it more than anything else because I think there's so pretty I almost said the S word but I did it okay so this is what they look like it's kind of hard to like see it without the reflection but it's like the I think it's tortoise is that what it's called where it's like um multicolored that's this one and then there's also clear one I have another one that's also clear but if you guys are needing some blue light glasses or if you feel like your eyes are constantly strained I definitely give this a try I know you can change your screen to be blue light blocking or whatever but for me I just don't like the way that the colors look and because a lot of what I do requires me to like edit photos and whatnot when I put that on it changes the way the photo looks so then I'm not able to accurately see what it looks like so I don't like using that setting on there or on my phone or and thing else basically I'll just use those because then you can easily take it out and off so let me know what it is that you have been loving it during quarantine and what has been your favorite and what you are doing every day to bring yourself joy don't forget to do that please I'm begging you okay I love you guys and I will see you in my next video back hey guys welcome to today's video I'm going to be walking you through some things I'm gonna be doing it different with my new baby I'm going to be due next month which is crazy this pregnancy again I say every time but it's going by so fast the entire time I have been kind of like keeping a list of things that I remember that I did was my daughter Lacey on but I was like mmm you know I don't really think I want to do that again or I know for sure I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna do this instead so I was like in my own head and keeping like a running list of things I want to do differently and I've had so many of you asked me what I'm gonna be doing differently as well so I thought it'd be such a good idea to just make a video about it and talk about it and if any of you are first-time moms maybe this will help you kind of like navigate maybe something that you want to do or don't want to do or just like hear first-hand from someone who did it and isn't gonna do it again and what I will be doing differently so I am going to be getting into all of that today this dress I feel like I'm gonna get questions about it cuz I posted about it yesterday on Instagram but this is actually from our local grocery store which is Meijer I don't know if everyone has a Meijer it's kind of like Kroger Walmart whatever but they have like really cute clothes and I'm like running out of things to wear because I do not fit in anything and this was $15 so I don't know if you have on my ear near you but I'll try to link it down below I don't even know if they like have a website where you can like link close to I don't know we'll see but I really like this dress Stiga no I don't know why you said that I'm like in such a good mood today I've been feeling so productive and I've gotten so much stuff then so I'm like very happy right now but I've also been drinking this all day which is my new favorite drink ever this is going to be like my summer drink you know how like we all like love to drink stuff in the summer this is gonna be mine okay I'll just share it with you real quick and then we'll get on to the video you probably don't even care but it's so good so this is just infused water what I did was add fresh mint cucumber strawberry and lime all together and let it sit overnight and then I just like a refill it with water all day long I keep it like in a pitcher and then I just refill and it's so good and it's so fresh and like so hydrating and I'm obsessed if you're not like a big water drinker try this cuz you're still drinking water but it like tastes really good so I just had to throw that out there I did do a little refresh over here with the background I mean I don't know like if I'm a hundred percent done I still have a couple of things coming in but we're looking a little bit better if you guys liked this video and want more modern things before this baby comes and let me know let me know other video ideas you guys have as well she's got subscribe down below before you guys leave and follow me old friend instagrams so you get behind the scenes stuff of everyday life and let's get started okay so first I'm gonna start off with Labor because just like my whole labor experience with my daughter was oh it was just not it sis like it was nothing like I had planned for this Labor what I'm doing different is I'm not gonna have a birth plan so I had a birth plan with Alethea and they say to come up with the birth plan just so you kind of like know what to expect but then not till I get upset if it doesn't go to plan because it probably won't go to plan so that's kind of my whole thinking with this one is I'm not really gonna come up with one because I know it's not gonna go to plan this time around I'm just going to pray and push beep eat pray and push that is what I'm gonna do this time I really enjoyed my labor as like ironic as that sounds like it was hectic it was crazy but to me I think the whole laboring process and the whole experience is just such an experience that it's unforgettable and like I loved it I really did enjoy it I think about it all the time and and I'm excited to do it again like it didn't scare me away if you have no idea what I'm even talking about I will link my labor videos and my labor experience up here for you guys but it was very intense I was in labor for about 30 hours and I had multiple blood transfusions it was just like a lot but again I think that whole experience is so beautiful and I'm just not gonna come up with the plan this time another thing I'm gonna do that's different is I would like to labor on all four like hands and knees the reason for that is because I I tore so badly and I really don't want to do that again and I've heard that laboring on all four is better and that things are like easier and the whole thing about laboring and delivering on your back is honestly more so for convenience so for you it probably will end up feeling a lot better to be on all four or on the side like I want to I want to deliver in a different position than I did with Alesia I don't want to be laying at my back it didn't feel comfortable I had a lot of pressure it just I want to do it different yes you can still labor on all four with the epidural you can do whatever you want no one can tell you no you can have your child in whatever position you want to have so if you are a new time mom definitely look into different positions that people do different ways that you can labor different ways you can deliver look all in to that cuz it's definitely not just sitting back and going ah with your arms and legs up okay one thing I didn't do is I had a playlist but my playlist was very calming music very relaxing music and that was the last thing I wanted to listen to when I was in labor so this time around I'm gonna make a playlist with much better music with like hype music instead because that's what I ended up listening to and I just ended up putting on like a random Pandora station I gave birth to my daughter listening to this very like EDM style music which I'm into but I were like would have liked to have select the best song beforehand because every time I hear that song now I think of my daughter so I want to pick a song to deliver him to and make sure it's a good song make sure it's like a hype song because I didn't do that with Eliseo another thing was this whole labor situation and this was something I had planned pre quarantine so I am going to be delivering when we're still going through this pandemic I'm not sure how things will be so far my doctor has told me that I will be able to have my husband in there so hopefully that will continue and like that won't be a thing right now no guests are allowed though but that was something I had made a rule for myself before pre quarantine I do not want any guests and the reason for that is because after I had my daughter lay Thea I was so excited for everyone to meet her but I had not recovered and then the thing is you are so out of it you are so exhausted and like there's so much going on in your body guys your body just did like an amazing thing you're so out of it I hadn't slept for like three days prior to delivering her and then I delivered her I was literally if you watched my video I'm literally like falling asleep my eyes are rolling to the back of my head in between pushes like it was it's just so exhausting and we had our family come and meet her like an hour and a half after I had delivered and of course everyone stays of course everyone like wants to talk and chat which is fine but like not right after you give birth and I kind of like had a plan and like set stuff up but no one listened no one stick to it so yes we were super excited to introduce our baby to our family but it could have waited at least like maybe five hours or six hours you know like we could have waited it a little bit just so I could like catch my breath and like sleep for a couple of hours and then we could introduce her I'm excited sad that I won't be able to have guests but I'm really gonna take advantage of that because that will probably be the only time in our lives that it'll just be me Jorden and baby boy because our daughter won't be allowed in there so it'll be like the only moment that will honestly ever get just the three of us bonding and getting to know each other first and then meeting everyone else your mama right now I mean it is a little bit because of the pandemic like normally people do have visitors and whatnot but for me I just like moving forward really just probably just want my parents and Jordans parents to like come directly after and then everyone else can wait until we get home because it was just a lot and I just did not honestly was not in the mood to like be talking and everything okay next a little category and there's only one thing in this category but I thought it was very important to note so for post hard something I'm going to be doing differently this time is I would like to wear a support band or like a belly band of some type right after delivery and the reason for that is because after I had my daughter you obviously still are pregnant you're very swollen your uterus is very swollen things are going back into place but for me the biggest thing was I had no core and no control and it just really hurt my back because things just like felt strange so had I had like some type of support band or some type of support thing on I would have felt a lot more comfortable and a lot more like postured so this time around that is something I'm going to do and I'm not sure what one I'm gonna get yet I've been watching tons of videos and like trying to find out which one is best but if you guys recommend any please leave a link down below I thought about getting at Kim Kardashian's what do they call the sculpting ones but I wasn't sure if those would be too tight I wasn't sure if you need to get one specifically for postpartum because I'm not doing it for like aesthetic reasons I'm not getting it because I want to like look skinny I just really just want more of the support cuz I remember that feeling of like feeling so weak in your course so I definitely want to wear something like that and then I'm still gonna do the same thing that I did postpartum for like my downstairs area and I did an entire video on this so I'll link it up here for you guys but the way that I recovered I think was pretty good and I think what I did and my system that I had for like underwears and pad and the water squirts thing.i I'm like I think I did good with that so I'm gonna basically do everything the same this time around okay next category is the newborn category so things that I'll be doing with him that I didn't do was a lengthy out or did do with like the oh but I want to do differently so this is something that makes me feel really guilty and I just I don't know why I did this and I don't even intentionally think I did this but I was not really like into snuggling Alethea or like holding her all the time if she was sleeping I would put her in her crib or I'd put her in her snuggle me or I'd put her like in something instead of just like holding and snuggling her and part of the reason of that was because I like wanted to get myself dressed I wanted to work or like do something else and I mean I did get my baby snuggles but I could have gotten more so this time around what I'm gonna do is wear him all the time snuggle him all the time and always have him on my chest or on my body or breastfeeding or whatever because I didn't do that with Olivia and I wish that I would have done it more and the thing is like I'm not gonna go down a rabbit hole of guilt tripping myself and thinking of things that I could have done better or could have like just done more or like get all guilty because I don't think that's healthy for any moms because you always wish you would have had more time or more snuggles or more love like you always will want more so I don't think it's worth like getting myself guilty into that but I will make more of a conscious effort to like wrap him and wear him and just have him physically on my body instead of like putting and setting him down more okay next thing and I'm so excited about this so with the lakeya when she was five months old we did the taking care of baby sleeping program which taught her how to like basically put herself to sleep and it changed our lives and it was the best thing in the entire world well taking care of baby also has a newborn class so I am going to be taking that newborn class and applying that to him before he gets born or like whenever he's born so I haven't signed up for the class yet it doesn't really matter you can just do it whenever but basically it will teach you certain things I haven't done it yet but I'm pretty sure that she'll kind of teach you the difference between like sleeping cues and hungry cues and just like what the baby is trying to tell you that you're not understanding because for me the beginning I feel like what ended up happening was I like aleisea did not sleep very well I wasn't sleeping very well I was breastfeeding so much and I feel like because I wasn't able to distinguish her sleeping cues versus her hungry cues I kept getting them mixed up so really she just wanted to sleep but I was trying to feed her and then it ruined my supply and I didn't have a good supply and then it came and then it went like it was just kind of all over the place so one thing I want to do is that newborn class to kind of give me some direction and some clarity as to what I should be doing because even though like with ilithyia we figured it out I'd rather just have that class and like have that peace of mind before him another thing is with ilithyia we actually had her sleep in her smuggle meat and at the time I thought that was okay and safe sleep it's actually not babies are not supposed to sleep in anything other than a crib that is empty and they can be swaddled but that's about it for some reason I was under the impression that you could use this angle me for them to sleep in all night but I followed the stuff in the account and they've made it clear many times that it is not safe and that is not what it's intended for its intended to be like a lounger for you to put them in like for naps during the day or like in the middle of the day so that was something I noted and won't be doing with him I'll just put him in his crib with the thing wrapped up what's it called the swaddle and that's it and then I'll leave this novel me for like other things which I love the song with me trust me like I love that thing and used it a lot with Alesia so I'm still going to use it but during the day time not for soup another thing I'm gonna do and this one I'm probably gonna say because I didn't have the to say the first time and that is that I'm not going to listen to unsolicited advice and I so strongly say that because I feel like because I was a new time mom I was young I mean I'm still young but like because I was new to everything everyone and I'm telling you everyone felt the need to tell me what to do or correct what I was doing and I just think that's so disrespectful and people don't even realize that I know they're doing it out of the good of their heart and they genuinely want to help but that doesn't help I'm sorry it just does it so this time around I'm going to like put my foot down and not let people walk all over me because there are some like things that I've like vividly remembered that I'm like why did I listen to that because it clearly went so wrong and as the mom you know what's best for your baby and no you know your baby best so I wish I would have like focused on that more and I wish I would have trusted myself more and like trusted but I I knew because at the end of the day it didn't end up helping me listen to anyone's unlisted it's a vice and I'm not talking about people on the internet because I don't listen to that but I'm talking about like people and friends and whatever that would come over and whatnot so that's something I'm gonna be doing and probably doing I just had to add that one in there it may sound kind of sassy but guys I'm telling you people just love to tell new moms what to do especially first-time moms and then next and last thing that I'm going to be doing is I'm actually going to take a maternity leave so with aleisea I was editing a video and making videos the day I came home from the hospital and I never really gave myself like a chance to like relax and calm down and part of the reason why I did it is because I really didn't want to get postpartum depression and I know myself and I really struggle with finding my identity from what I do so for me I love my job and I love to work and so for me I find value in that so if I'm not doing that I feel less about myself which is not good like that's a whole nother issue I've done many podcasts this topic before if you guys want to check those out but it's just something that I've dealt with so this time around I want to make sure I take a maternity leave and I did it the first time because like I was saying I just didn't want to get postpartum depression and keeping myself busy was a way to like not get it so this time around I think I'll have plenty on my hands to deal with with a newborn and another baby my daughter is gonna be 16 months by the time I deliver so I'm gonna have two babies to take care of so I feel like my hands will be pretty full and I won't have to like keep myself busy or preoccupied I'm still going to be uploading I'm still going to be vlogging but I'm just going to take a step back because I was still posting and uploading 2 to 3 times a week which is a lot so I'm gonna tone it down to probably once a week maybe twice depending you know it all depends but I am gonna make sure to like take a step back and just let myself breathe for a little bit enjoy the baby phase enjoy all of that and not feel like I have to keep myself so busy so those are things I'm going to be doing differently with this baby I'm pretty sure that's all those things I have thought of if I think of anything else I'll make sure to LIKE comment it down below hope you guys enjoyed this video hope that it was helpful I love you guys so much thank you for watching and I will see you my next video hey guys good morning and welcome to today's vlog I have a reason to get out of the house today I have a doctor's appointment and it feels so strange to like have a reason to get out of the house but since I've been pregnant my doctor and since everything has been going on I don't know why my voice sounds kind of raspy right now it's still kind of early in the morning these are the few first words out of my mouth my doctor since kovat happened has been canceling my appointments and hasn't been really seeing me because she says it's not necessary she doesn't feel like I need to be going in unless it's like 100% necessary so normally at this point so I am 34 weeks normally at this point I would already be going every two weeks and then next week I would start going every week so coz like the further along you get the more you go so normally you go once a months and then you go twice a week and then once a week but because of everything I've just been going once a month even less than that there was one week that I hadn't gone in like seven weeks or something so I haven't been going to the doctor that frequently which is like making me not feel like I'm as far along as I am I say this every time but it's just going by so fast and yesterday I kind of started freaking out in bed because I was like Jordan we're having a baby next month and we are not prepared like mentally I'm prepared yes but as far as like in the house like we do not have any baby stuff because we haven't been able to order anything so for example I wanted to get him a crib from Ikea I wanted his dresser from Ikea cuz it's affordable and it's what I used for Leigh Thea and I loved him but IKEA is not shipping stuff right now I've tried multiple times getting it and the one time I was able to finally get it said I wouldn't come until the end of July almost August and he's due in June so I was like I'm not gonna order it if it's gonna be here after he comes I also ordered a bassinet for inside of our room and that's not coming until like the week he's supposed to be born so and we don't have his nursery done yet I'm like trying to put it together but it's really hard to decorate a nursery strictly using stuff online so I just like that's the reason why I don't feel as prepared or I don't feel like I'm as far along as I am because there's just so many other things going on so that was a tangent but I'm gonna bring you guys along with me to my doctor's appointment today to show you guys how different it is and yeah it's just different that's what I'll say when you go to the doctors you have to take they take your temperature as soon as you walk into the building you have to wear a mask I don't think they're requiring gloves at this point maybe they are they weren't the last time I went in but then again that was five weeks ago so no one is allowed to come with me so Lacey I can't come with me Jordan can't come with me none of that so my mom is watching the Lai Thea so I can go to this appointment and yeah so it's just it's just been a very different pregnancy but yeah today I'm just going to be vlogging catching you guys up doing a little bump updates and all of that talking about how this pregnancy has been and all that fun stuff I ran out of matchups I've been drinking coffee but I've been enjoying the coffee coz I love coffee so I did a quick refresh of our room I've been trying to do my pelvic bone my whole pelvic region is just like always very uncomfortable so I've basically been just like tucking in all my shirts because I don't even look pregnant good fret but this is what my belly is looking like it's honestly the exact same size that it was when I went to deliver Alethea I'll try to find like a comparison photo but my stomach is very large and I'm very low and honestly I feel very uncomfortable but let me show you our room refresh so first of all I move this mirror so this mirror was actually normally right over here but because I want I'm putting mirrors on top of our nightstands I had to move that one because it would look weird to have two mirrors right next to each other so I found this at Target it is from Studio McGee target app pick up target pick up has been my best friend since all of this has gone on so I got one for each of us Jordans is still downstairs but my goal is to put the mirrors right behind our night tables so the this mirror Jordan will hang up here and then we got this new rug so I ordered this from rugs USA no it's from overstock and if you guys follow me on instagram when it first came in I was freaking out because I ordered it's supposed to be like a brown rug but when it came in it was blue so guys literally blue but I moved it in here and it doesn't look as blue anymore it does look a little bit more Brown and I like it so I'm gonna keep it but that is something new I already showed you guys this I kind of did like a whole vlog on this whole corner of the room but other than that the only other thing in our bathroom I put our plant here she was originally over there by the pictures but I put her in here which has been really good for her because she gets like direct sunlight in here and then I got this new hanging pot to hang and that's gonna go right up there Jordan just has to hang it that's the thing and then I also got a new phone case and I am obsessed with the pop socket it's a small shop on Etsy I found her on Instagram and she's so sweet and so cute so I will link this down below she does sell out very quickly and she restocks every Friday I believe so I set my alarm two minutes before her restock and I was on her account and I just kept refreshing the page and I was able to get it but then it sold out 15 minutes later so it's serious I know I feel like a lot of people who want these so I'll link that down below but it's handmade it's Rutan and it's so stinking cute I said stinking yes I did all right I'm gonna head downstairs for a second okay so currently in my office I've been sticking to a really good schedule and routine since Jordan has gone off to work and that was something that I really wanted to make sure that I did because it's so easy to lose track of time and I feel like with quarantine and I like asked you guys on Instagram to in a lot of you have said that your days go by so fast so I I really hard to like make sure to stick to my schedules so I've been using like new not apps but like new things to like help me manage my time and I've been using like new things I'm like different like workflow things and different things to just help me stay organized and it's been super helpful so I've thought about bringing back my whole like YouTube how-to videos I started these before I gave birth to lay Thea and then I kind of took like a break it's been like over a year since I've done one but if you guys are interested in that let me know because I'd love to help anyone out and help anyone who is currently at home and like share my little two cents and tips on how I keep myself organized and like I'm able to get things done but also be a mom and pregnant and all the other shenanigans that's going on so the thing I'm currently working on right now is I am redoing and revamping my website sorry as soon as I open it it like all these emails start coming in I am revamping my website because I want to start using it more like a blog and the reason for that is because I just love blogs myself and I want to start using it more like that I want it to be more of like a resource page for you guys and I really want to start doing a newsletter where every week I will send out to you guys like little bump update a little sensory toy rotation that I'm doing with lazy that week to like give you guys some inspiration I wanted to do Scripture and a memory verse I was going to link any of our podcast episodes and YouTube videos or anything like that and kind of just give you guys like words of encouragement and wisdom let me know if that is something that you guys are interested in I'm also working on my next devotional and the thing is I'm not sure if it's going to come out before or after baby boy I mean it's not something that I want to rush obviously but that is something I'm working on so I'm super excited I feel like I have so many like little things that I'm trying to do before he come to kind of get everything figured out so that is what I'm going to spend my morning doing right now is ramping up my website fixing all these things and putting everything together and then I'll get back to you guys before we go to the appointment       that's how high my daughter's used to be more user-friendly it's a lot more customizable okay so this is what you'll see when you open up the website I still have to change the background of that but I have four clickable links right here that goes to Instagram of the extra near my house page my youtube channel and our podcast and then these are currently the set up of like clickable things I have so I don't know if we should take out YouTube because this just starkly takes them to YouTube which is what this does so I kind of think I'm gonna take that one out mom and baby should be its own category and then there you put like that could be like a sub kit like it'd be like a larger category and then underneath that you have subcategories such as like newborn essentials and then alright guys I'm back home as you saw it Jordan came home to and I was kind of strategizing and cleaning a couple of things with him before my website but the doctor's appointment went well she said things are looking good he's head down which I I feel like he's been had done the entire time and she said things are looking good I'm measuring at 33 weeks so even though I feel big she says I'm measuring right on track so that's good and she actually said that she wants to see me every two weeks now that's fine I mean at this point I actually should be going once a week but yeah so I mean more appointments for that but as you guys saw like when you go in they take your temperature and you have to have a mask on and then you have to wear a mask when you're there the time where is my going Nikki 232 and down because she walks like a drunken suicide yeah they were pushed fell oh okay I came upstairs for a second I just got a package from Amazon that I've been waiting for him so I'm going to do a video on my channel of my favorite Amazon decor things because I have found quite a few really really cute unique pieces on Amazon for a very good price and this is one of the things that I wanted to get for my office and I'm a little bit nervous because it's a statue so I wanted to get something kind of like a bit like a statement piece for the office because I'm trying to like get unique things and like I didn't want to just have like books and vases and flowers so the ladies   oh wait I'm shook I love the way she smells do you like it - lady without a phone call wow this is nice guys it's not heavy I thought it was gonna be like more heavy but it looks expensive and online it looks kind of grey so I was a little bit nervous but it's white it's like a cream white cup not in this eye cream this is straight-up white yeah I like my headless lady she's not hit-list I like my armless lady this looks so cool ah I'm so excited to do this Amazon video guys I love the way she smells when I am pregnant I am so weird about smells I love the smell of like packaging I love the smell of tires I love the smell of sharpies gasoline I like love those so excited alright let's go put her down there real quick Jordan's on a phone call I don't know if I already said that but he's on a phone call that's why I came up here but we'll be quiet and we'll go back down there and OH set her up   all right my mom just texted me and said that Olivia woke up from her nap so I'm going to meet my mom at halfway and get her and the reason why my mom is watching her was because of that doctor's appointment Alethea and no one can come with me and Jordan was working today and my sister isn't here so my mama is the one that had to watch to close I'm gonna go oh my what do you see what go see how you died yeah go give that dad hug oh she's shy so one shy so once I decide so busy what new stickers you need the ground beef and then another thing yeah I think you do the Gumby first then you add the broccoli for dinner tonight we're thinking of doing a beef and broccoli you like that's always like my go-to and I don't know what to do with beef I follow this recipe on Pinterest it's super yummy it's super flavorful I believe it's like just brown sugar and soy sauce we have aminos at they called amino acids something coconut aminos coconut aminos which is a gluten-free option for soy sauce but it literally tastes the exact same how's your workout can't relate that looks so good honey here Wow I just told Jordan anytime he helps makes me very attracted to him because she's not already no I'm just saying when you cook it's just it makes me very happy mmm you would you like to pray before we you want to pray okay thank you God for just providing all of our needs more than what we need help us to share your abundant of joy and provision with others Lord we need it thank you for this food let it nourish our bodies and - of your word which is for our soul what is it amen amen nothing I don't know if you heard but that scream that she just did that that's your China say Amen and it's the sweetest thing in the entire world so Jordan started praying with her and like what   No well yeah I after if she wanted to receive Jesus okay one night I just like telling her about the gospel about our hearts are bad but broken and we can't fix it but there is somebody who can write and I put her down the whole know I have to do is all you have to do is fill out your dinner before I have to do is pray and ask Jesus into your life and into your heart I said I didn't want to do that and she nodded so I prayed with her and at the end I said Jesus name Amen but she has her bottle and she goes ba ba but active that we started praying with her every night and every time like we pray before we eat or well with our family like we always put our hands together just to see if she would do it and she does it now and she does it every time we put her down for a nap or every time that we're eating she'll just put her hands together and then mid prayers she'll scream like saying Amen raise dude you're so precious understand oh yeah oh yeah that's something that we're another dad for 14 months no mm-hmm yeah I feel like people totally underestimate how smart they are for five seconds later and so what happens huh what bad guys you're done you know knows where's your angry face I'm gonna touch my nose dude you know what touch those nose our household rule is if one person cooks the other one cleans so what's its latest pregnant I will help clean as well Oh go to bed time with tricks okay kitchen is all nice and clean the dishwasher is on and running right now if you guys saw my tidy clean video I share all my little hacks of like how to keep the house clean and tidy like 24/7 obviously it's not 24/7 but I did share quite a lot of my tips and my biggest one is to run that dishwasher at night not during the day so I just did that Jordan is putting a lengthy up to bed it's her bedtime we're gonna go walk the dogs right now because they need to go out I'm gonna close that today's video in today's vlog I hope you guys enjoyed and liked it and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys welcome to my channel if you're new here and welcome back if you've been here many times before today i am going to be doing a amazon haul fine decor style video i've seen so many people doing this on youtube and i've loved and watched every single one of them and then i started to discover that amazon actually has really nice stuff for decor and since my beloved home goods and beloved tj maxx is closed and i'm grieving i've had to find different alternatives um i'm currently decorating it for my baby boys nursery so it's been very challenging decorating a whole entire nursery without ever physically going into a store to see what things look like but i have found quite a few pieces and it's not just stuff for the nursery i've been kind of revamping all of my rooms and just kind of like trying to finish decorating my house before my baby comes and i have found some really affordable good nice pieces from amazon and i'll just say i'm like feeling so pregnant right now guys i literally was sitting here right about to start to film and i had to take off my bra and i had to unbuckle my pants i honestly wouldn't even be wearing pants right now but there is a window right there so everyone would just like see me naked so just had to throw that out there i'm just like so uncomfortable i'm gonna be 35 weeks and i'm feeling so pregnant if you guys like these styles of videos i feel like i've been doing quite a few more sit down videos um and hauls and stuff if you guys want me to keep doing those make sure to give this video a thumbs up and make sure to subscribe so you don't miss out on any of my videos and my birth video that is going to be here very soon and then let's go ahead and get started going to start with two things that i got for baby boys room so first one is this macrame i believe that's what it's called the macrame plant holder um and this was like 10 bucks so i plan on putting this somewhere in his room i'm not entirely sure where probably in a corner but i have tons of houseplants and my favorite plant is the pathos which is like the one that hangs down so this is perfect for that so you probably can't really tell what it's going to look like but the pot sits at the bottom right here and then this just kind of hangs and then the plant hangs down underneath i thought this was really cute and that's about it it's really cute i'm gonna try to expand my vocabulary as much as i can during this video so i'm not just saying it's cute it's adorable and it's stinking the entire time so i'm gonna try my best okay next thing that i got is to hang over his crib and that is this beautiful thing honestly i don't even know what this is called um i wanted one that actually had like a little lion's face on it i saw it on pinterest and i was obsessed with it but i could not find it so i found this instead i think it's just so pretty it's like the exact theme and vibe i'm going for in his room which is very like neutral jungly boyish style so this thing is really big i mean it wasn't the cheapest i feel like if i would have gone to homegood they would have been able to get it for a better price but again we're working with what we got here and the quality is really nice so i think this is going to be a really good statement piece in this room but so cool okay moving on now this next category is basically everything else that i've like put in my house so if you guys follow me on instagram or have watched any of my stuff i have a very like combination style so i guess i would have i would it's kind of hard to describe my style because there's certain parts of my house it is like one theme and then another part that's another theme but overall i feel like i have like more of a bohemian minimal scandinavian kind of style like i kind of do like a mixture of things so that's like what you'll kind of see here so i really like using textures and different beads to decorate and one of those are these prayer beads i had some in other places in my house and then i saw that amazon had them so i got these so this was actually a pack of three so it came with these two and then this really large one so with the large one i love wrapping this around vases or anything that's just like sitting there over any books um just like it just adds texture it just adds a little something something to the table because of these little guys and this and you can kind of like wrap around and kind of do whatever you want with it um to be honest these guys don't actually fit over any of the bases in my house is kind of small that's the only downside to it if you do have smaller vases this would be able to fit on the neck really well but uh mine are really big so i'm just gonna hang on to these until i finish baby boy's room i'll probably end up putting them in there but i will just say that's the only thing i noticed is that these are pretty small so definitely like pay attention to that before ordering but they also do just sell it like this and i believe this was like 13 or 14 bucks for the entire pack so again very affordable i'm gonna move on to ceramics so i have like fallen in love with vases i don't know why but i've just like really fallen in love with them and i found really really cute ones on amazon i particularly ordered this one so this is about a foot i think it's 11 inches and this is exactly what i needed to complete my background right here which is in my office so i needed a vase that was this size and i just love the color love the print it's real ceramic it was very affordable as well and i'm just obsessed i think it's so pretty and very simple i'll link tons of other ones down below too that i really liked but didn't really have the need to buy it yet but i will but i will link those down for you guys but i just am obsessed with this and i think it's just so pretty i really like flowers but i didn't want to keep putting them in vases so one like very simple obvious thing that isn't so obvious to me was glass and using glass to hold flowers and like different things so i found tons on amazon that were very affordable um and i've been using them to store my dried up flowers i have this one then i also have that one back there but they were so affordable okay this next thing is hands down my favorite piece i've ever bought from my house maybe that's a little bit dramatic i wouldn't say it's like it's my favorite decor piece that i've ever bought for my house because it's just so different and so unique and just is makes such a statement and that is my lady friend over here hi how's it going isn't she so cool she looks like she's made out of marble but she's not i don't know what she's made out of she's not very heavy she's actually very lightweight but she's like the perfect size it's such a statement piece she's white and clean and just looks so cool and just so different and i had this in my cart from cb2 but it was 200 and i was like ugh i can't justify that so then i was like let me see if i can find any on amazon and i found this girl and she was 30 i think so very affordable i saved some cash and she's so cool they have larger ones and they have smaller ones too i kind of want to get some of the smaller ones to just like put on top of books or just like put them in certain places but i figured i'd start with the big one to make sure i like it and i did and she's beautiful and gorgeous so they have men as well they have different styles they have like different body positions and whatnot but girlfriend is just stunning you are stunning okay now that i'm done being creepy with her next thing is something that is so practical and my favorite a closer but it's a marble coaster and it's a black marble coaster so i love this i use coasters all the time because a lot of my pieces are like real wood and you can't put water on them so i just love having this around i have one in my office i have them in my living room i have them in my nightstand i have these all over my entire house and i just love how the stack is just very clean neutral goes with everything else isn't an eyesore and it's just very affordable so i'll also link that down below for you guys next peace i don't even know what this is called this is a decorative i guess it's a decorative bowl so i wanted something that was wooden and i wanted something that was long so i was like what else do i use so i just looked up some wooden bowls and i love this one the color is really really pretty um it's not finished it's like this like soft wood and i just have it in my office just laying there it's such a statement piece on its own you could fill it up with like different like filler pieces you could put some flowers in here you could also put some like different fruits if you want or you could put like those vase fillers you could put those beads in here there's so many different options of like what you could do in here but for me i wanted to keep it more simple and more minimal so i've just been using it by itself but it's so pretty and i think these types of bowls are just really nice to have because they add different elements of texture and just like make up like a space look a little bit warmer so they have smaller ones they have like actual vases and bowls and different things so you guys can definitely like search around but i really like this one and i love the size and the color and the price is just all around glorious all right next category are these coffee table books so these obviously are just normal books but people frequently use them as coffee table books and these are from joanna gaines so i love her books i've already read this one this is her newest book that came out i haven't read it yet but i just love the look of her books and obviously we know that she wants us to use them for decor because that's why she makes them so pretty but um i just love the look of these and the great thing about amazon is you can buy them used as well so i have found these two i also have another set of coffee table books that are coming in but they're a lot larger but they were also very affordable because i bought them used so i will link those down below as well but i just love using coffee table books just to elevate pieces or just like make something look really pretty and it's just like so easy to use and obviously because then people will read them because they're out and about so that's always good as well but these are my two favorite i think they look really pretty together okay last thing i know this is an amazon haul but i recently discovered that h m has decor and their stuff is so nice and i ordered this little trinket little thing it's actually it's a candle holder i think but it's so pretty and looks so antique to me and it was two dollars so i just want to throw that out there i think it's really cute so if you guys are like looking for any home decor stuff definitely check out h m home because their stuff is really cute let's put that little guy there okay well that's everything i'm pretty sure yeah i have a couple of other things that are coming in but honestly i didn't want to wait for them because i just wanted to film this video and show you guys what i have gotten so far um one of my favorite companies though is this one right here it's called creative creative co-op that's where i got this but they have tons of stuff like tons of really cute decor so i'll link some of the things down below that i thought like is just so beautiful and such a good price now that i'm like used to shopping online i feel like it's gonna be kind of weird going in stores for things because i'm gonna be like i can touch it i can feel it it's gonna feel kind of strange but i hope you guys liked this haul let me know if you guys would like another one and i will see you in my next video  love your heart your part is cute             did it welcome to city it's going to be a damn the light kind of just saw like our morning routine so mornings are always a group effort with Jordan nice so you normally will make us breakfast so today he made us some eggs and bacon and then I will normally like clean up and during all of that we always do believe he has some type of like snack to eat because girlfriend is hungry so today she just had like a banana while we were doing all of that and like getting the eggs ready normally she'll have blueberries or like something some type of fruit or whatnot and then once my mornings are like the times that I like spend with her so after we're done anyone do a first little cleanup and then people walk the dogs and that's when we do a laziest morning walk so she loved her morning walks we call it our child walks this is a cat make huh what does a cat make I don't change her out of her PJs what I normally don't change her out of her PJs until after breakfast so welcome when she wakes up we'll just change her diaper keep her in her PJ's cuz my mother she'll get kind of musty when she's eating her food and then she'll go down for her nap and when she wakes up from her nap and when we put her in her outfit of the day that's why I ma'am is still here so I've recently been getting ready before I come downstairs to eat breakfast because I don't take long to get ready it takes me like maybe five minutes so it just makes me feel like I have a head start on the day and it's just so much easier to just get it out of the way first thing in the morning so that's what I've been doing so while I do that only to clean your playroom she'll do it Jordan she returned to brush her teeth she'll just like keep herself occupied and busy upstairs while we like make the bed thrown in showers I'd do my makeup all that that doesn't take very long and then we head down in do back up stuff   I have my coffee ready I've been drinking some warm coffee and I take it on our walk with us every morning hey you saying bye daddy's watching Samson don't put your shoes on you pick out your shoes me just one run wear your rain boots you want the Cheetahs okay to keep big toe to toe shoes hey where are you going did you like your mama all right we just gave a computer walk honestly wasn't that long normally those walks are like what five to ten minutes bath huh now making her Bubba she's not gonna go down for it now just yes she'll normally nap around and it is 9:30 so go warm up your bus so I don't have to come back down the stairs my life is basically planned around how many times I should go up and down the stairs so I try to go out with you down minimal as possible yeah so we're gonna go upstairs for her to play in her playroom a little bit yes we want to watch it thank you son she still just drinks a bottle she has two bottles a day three bottles a day she really likes her bottles and she has oat milk that's what her pediatrician recommended we give to her so that and she left it so today there's gonna be two things I'm gonna be keeping a tracker of one is how many times I use the bathroom because it's insane how frequently I have to go and then the other one is how often Alethea asks to pray so she recently has gotten into praying so we pray with her every night and just recently she figured out how to say Amen and she puts her hands together but she wants to do it all day long which is so sweet so we always just make an effort to pray every time that she asked the Bible says to pray without ceasing so - he is a perfect example of that children are just so stinking pure and she's literally living through it should also keep us thinking about yes I'll keep a count of when I say stinkin but I'm not gonna try to do it   thank you Jesus for another morning teacher the sunshine to the birds will give you a beautiful day amen amen hey everything yeah love you okay baby is asleep now it is time for me to work so heating pad is a must for me when I'm pregnant especially because I spend in long hours just sitting down so I always have a heating pad like on my back I'll put it on my tummy I like rotate around and then I always make sure to have water with me too I try to like bring as much stuff as I can just over to this area so I don't have to keep getting up because like I said it just takes a lot of effort to get up all the time so I'm trying to like be sitting and not having to get up as much as possible so I have my ispotter you with me my heating pad I have all my stuff with me so right now I've gotten in a really good schedule so either I am filming or editing I like each day so I normally upload two to three times a week so Monday's I will normally film if I didn't film on Sunday and then the next day I'll edit it the next day I'll film next day I'll edit that's kind of just like how it works and then we do have a podcast but we are currently on a break for that so I wanted to take a break from it earlier and so I could start like taking like my material even like slowly start pulling back on a couple of projects and things so not doing the podcast has opened up a lot of time so what I've been doing instead is working on my website so either I'll be editing and filming a video or I will be working on my website and revamping and like rebranding and that has taking so much time and I'm also working on my next devotional so that also takes up a lot of time but for today I am going to just be enemy so this I need these these are the blue lucky glasses I did a haul for you guys of things that are like bringing me joy during quarantine and like things that have been helping me get through it and these are one of them because I just spend so much time on the computer so I'll link that video down below for you guys but I'm gonna get sir on this video and try to get as much done before I lay Thea wakes up so she actually known really will nap for about two hours two and a half hours sometimes three normally a minimum of two hours so I know I have from ten to twelve to work and get this stuff done so that is when I'll get a majority of my editing done and then once she wakes up I will take a like lunch break and normally someone will come to watch so in about two hours three hours I will take a lunch break when it should wake up from pronounced   you're someone fun fact I actually do not have a baby monitor burn affray yeah okay your genes us thank you for our one with the map baby feel for our fall who's gonna come and spend the day with us with the sunshine in Jesus name we pray amen amen look here you look so pretty oh do you have a good nap I'm gonna pray again okay why don't you pray my mom innit right dear Jesus thank you again for in the beautiful sunshine and birds and some nap time okay that will have a nice in plastic amen amen I love your heart your pipe is beautiful whenever she wakes up from her nap is when I will take my like little lunch break so will normally play for a little bit I'll change her outfit and then my mom will get here and then we'll have lunch together and she'll eat and then she will go and play with your grandma well I finished back which ball would you like to wear tonight it's lunch time we are having leftovers that we had last night so just rice broccoli and some salmon I always try to make enough so I don't have to like make any lunch the next day dance happy dance happy happy food and food yes yes pray again okay give me your hands together Oh Joyce okay before we eat dear Jesus thank you for 2p and for heir to your mommy is for the beautiful day today amen hey nice pretty crabby who knows okay we just finished up lunch so right now is 1 o'clock so she woke up around 12:00 um so she only ended up taking about a two hour nap so normally like once we're done eating I will do a quick cleanup around the house and just I quickly put any of her toys away right now I'm just like cleaning up the dishes and stuff lunch and then I will get back to work so my mom isn't here yet so Melanie is was it like here right now I try to spend as much time with her as I can and then it's nice because then she'll be able to play with your auntie and go outside and do fun things and whatnot and then I can finish up work and then and then we'll keep keep on moving on one day   all right checking back in so my mom came and she was it's Alethea for a couple of hours it is now like quiet down or something we're buying ten I know Brazilians and Italians are so loud okay anyway it's 341 right now I just posted my video and did all of the promotion stuff they do for him so recently I've been posting photos on Instagram I do story and then I've been doing stuff on Pinterest as well but it was a Amazon decor haul so if you guys are curious about that video I'll link it down below I found so many cute things most of which are all back here behind me anyway and Alesi actually just went down for her nap normally ends up happening as I spend my mornings with her and then I get a couple of worthiness done when she's napping and then we'll do lunch together and then she'll spend a couple of hours with my mom or whoever's watching her while I worked and then she'll continue napping so I have a big chunk of time where I'm able to get more work done when she's with someone and then she's napping so I don't feel as guilty cuz she's like sleeping for a while so normally a video will take anywhere between I say a minimum of four hours a max of eight so this video took me about six hours to edit so I just finished that and I'm basically done for the day so I'm going to continue vlogging obviously but as far as like this video it's all done and set and ready so Lacey is napping right now this is when I'll get anything done so I've been doing laundry all day I haven't showed you guys but I have wondered what I need to do I would really like to work out today so we normally work out whether she's napping I also placed an order on target the target pickup app so I have that to pick up from Target but I think I'll wait until she wakes up so she can get out of the house come with me - back yeah that's what we are doing so far   well she's up from her nap and she just discovered her love for hummus and she's loving it are you happy show me your angry face   show me your cute face I am up here in the lengthiest play room with her even though she's not in the play room she plays everywhere except for the play room but this is what I like to call it with you Alethea this busy time this is when she will literally walk around the entire house playing with everything except for her actual toys and she just wants to walk around and go crazy and she honestly does a really good job at keeping yourself busy and entertained so I'm gonna sit in here for a second and just put my feet up I do have a little bit of swelling in my feet now so much like my toes but more so like my ankles and my calves get really swollen so I like to just rest and like sit for a little bit before I get started on dinner and everything and it's nice because she'll keep yourself busy so I'll be able to just sit here and you have some somewhat of peace time hi yes so busy a father we thank you for such a beautiful thing thank you for giving us your spirit and your loving your grace and thank you for all the gifts that you've given us Alethea among the most precious wins in the knowledge of you and that you would keep her safe in all things in jesus name amen amen   okay and is now 811 we just put lethea down for the night so she normally will go to bed anywhere between 7:30 to 8:00 o'clock and then as soon as I put her down it's my knee time and I love my nighttime routine and I'm not gonna go too into detail it was it today because I am gonna do an updated nighttime routine video for you guys and I like go full and depth for everything but basically as soon as lengthy goes time for bed I basically go to bed myself I'm normally in bed by 9:00 o'clock I'm not sleeping by 9:00 o'clock but I'm like in bed cozy have my iPad and I'm watching YouTube videos and just chilling online shopping all of that stuff so that is basically how my night will go because I just get so tired but the great thing about going to bed early is that I naturally wake up really early see like this morning I naturally one over on six on my own I don't set an alarm because my body just actually wakes up pretty early so I'm just going to remove my makeup right now I get most of my makeup off before I get into the shower and then when I'm in the shower I'll actually wash my face get all the gunk off I'm not gonna wash my hair I'm on day like five or four maybe even six I think I don't know but I'm gonna keep holding off I haven't even had a chance to wear hat yet so hats are my secret to covering up in here   okay I am ready for bed this is what my nightstand looks like I got my water my phone normally I have my iPad and I didn't grab them yet but I normally have anywhere between 4 to 6 popsicles every night before I go to bed I love cold things that's been like my favorite craving so I'll have like either flavored ice or popsicles and I have an abundance of them okay so judge me all you want and then this is my little bed set up and I'll normally put a couple of drops of like ellipta sore peppermint on here so it smells nice and wonderful and I will just chill here for the next couple of hours stretching my feet relaxing unwinding for the day and then everything starts back up at 6:00 the next day so I hope you guys enjoyed this vlog I will be doing a full inducting nighttime routine in a couple of weeks so be on the lookout for that I love you guys I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you in my next one bye hey guys welcome at to today's video if this was so requested and when I posted it on my Instagram that I was doing it so many of you said you were so excited and I didn't expect that because I don't know I don't know I just didn't expect that kind of response I'm feeling a little sassy today not gonna lie so there's so much going on because the first thing that's going on in the world right now I just am not mentally prepared to bring a child into the world to be honest and it's very scary and feels like my pregnancy has been kind of taken away from me because I'm literally stuck inside all day and I know it could be so much worse but I'm just quickly just ranting I don't know why I'm ranting but I am right now I'm in his nursery that is not complete at all I have zero baby things even in history like I haven't been able to order anything because everything is on back order all the stuff I have ordered aren't coming until after he's born even though I ordered way back in March it's just been a little frustrating and I feel like with my pregnancy with lethea I had everything set and ready to go like two months before she was born and he's gonna be here in a month and I have zero I mean I do have some things which obviously I'm gonna be showing you guys but as far as like actual things that you need for a baby I do not have I do not have an S and that I do not have a crib I do not have a changing table so obviously I can use the lengthiest but I will just say like for him and his own room and stuff like I don't have any of his things ready so I'm trying really hard not to like freak out and get upset because again I have ilithyia's room in ilithyia's things I want him to feel special and feel like he has his own things too sorry I did not mean to like start off on a rant but if anyone else is pregnant right now I feel like you can definitely relate to how I'm feeling can you like not gross I'm toning the video No today I am just going to be doing a haul of a couple of things that I have gone for him so honestly most of these things were gifted to me through my baby registry that I did I originally wasn't going to do one but a lot of my family members were asking if I would just quickly make a small one just so they knew what to get him and I tried to make it very simple and clean and minimal and I used the baby list I think this one was called it allows you to link many many websites so it's not like he registered at Target and you can only get stuff from Target so that was really nice because then I was able to get stuff from Etsy I was able to get stuff from like Crate and Barrel I was able to put tons of different websites on there where people could get stuff for him so that is why I'm just going to basically be showing you guys I'm going to separate it into different categories I'm gonna do close baby gadgets and that's it that's basically all that I have today so I hope you guys enjoyed this video again sorry for my little ramble in the beginning with aleisea I was pretty minimal this time I am as well and I'm gonna reuse quite a lot of things that I used for Olivia which is why I don't have as much clothes for him so when Olivia was in newborn a lot of the clothes that she wore was white and neutrals and creams and everything was gender neutral which I'm reusing for him so I personally have not bought him a single thing yet because I have so much left over from Malaysia so let me start with little gadgets and like little things for him so first thing is the diaper bag so I was so excited when I saw this color I'm not sure if they still have it but this is a fun designed diaper bag that's what I used for Alethea and this is in the original size I love this size because I feel like with two kids it's perfect I'll be able to fit both of their things in here I just love this color it like screams boy to me but it's not too boyish like it's just perfect I love it and I do have a code with them it's Molina 15 if you guys want to get 15% off they don't have any other codes going on so I'll leave a link down below but I love lime so much great company and this was like the first thing I was really I need to get for him next little thing is this nursing pillow now I used any nursing pillow with ilithyia I can't remember what the exact company was it's like the normal one that like everyone gets but I did not really like it it just wasn't ideal and I found myself using a pillow most of the time so when snow mommy said that they were launching and releasing their own nursing pillows I got so excited first of all I think this is so cute it looks like a little moon but it looks and it seems a lot more comfortable and just so much better and more supportive so obviously I haven't used it yet but I will give you guys an update once I do use it this is something that I knew I wanted to get once I saw that it was out so I'll link this and blow as well as everything else it's from snuggle me and of course I got a snuggle me as well so I already had one for Alethea that I will be using but I actually got a second one because in this house we have two floors and I figured I don't want to keep going up and down so I figured I would keep one snuggle me inside of a laziest playroom and then one snuggle me downstairs so I don't have to keep carrying them up and down but I just love this it's just a lounger I used to this so much with Alethea and she actually slept in it which I'm not gonna have him do because it is not safe sleep and I did an entire video on things I'm not doing this baby boy so I'll link that up here for you guys if you're curious but I guess this really pretty waffle cover that I really like and I have a cover from what I used it was aleisea but smell me is definitely a must next baby gadget thing and I had this with Alethea as well but I got a different color you know I like wanted to get new things for him because I wanted I want him to feel special and that just feel like he's reusing all of his sister's things so this is a cover from copper pearl it is a car seat cover a nursing cover it's like the five in one thing so I've used this a lot with Alethea when she was younger so this just goes over the car seat like that and it is known to be somewhere here so I don't expect to use it so much because this actually holds heat side so it's more so like for windy days rainy days there's and stuff like that and just to like protect him when we go out and about if we ever do go out and about I don't even know that we ever will but that is just it's a good option to have this and then I also like that you can use it as a nursing cover to just throw your head through this hole and just like cover but I love this color my friend Esther has this color and every time she'd come over I'm like I want that color it's so pretty so I have this and then for leafy I had like a floral black-and-white one that was really cute too okay the next thing for him are these divs so elysia is still has a binky and a pacifier and I wasn't gonna use like her pinkies and pacifiers for him and I saw this set it's a set of four and I loved the colors and they screamed boy and they screamed the aesthetic cuz I'm going for him which is like creams Browns creams Browns greens and mustard ease what you'll see but it's a pack of four and look how pretty these colors are I am I think they're so pretty Alania love these bibs still look I don't need to say bits cuz these are not bibs but the company is called bibs why I don't know because these are pacifiers so it's a little confusing I got hit in his own little pasties to have this should be more than enough hopefully a lakeya doesn't steal them from him but she does have some of these colors so I don't know if I should label them or what so that we don't get them confused but I wanted him to have his own pair and then to kind of go with that I do have tons of pass eclipse from aleisea that he can use but I did just get him this neutral colored one from an Etsy shop that I'll link down below but these are life-changing aleisea when she was a baby always had one of these on her so we didn't lose her pasties and clips and stuff so I will link all of these down below but I am going to try and see if he'll take the Ryan and Rose pacifier as well because I have tons of those left over from ilithyia she sadly did not take that Pasi but I'm gonna try with him and see um maybe he will maybe he won't even want a pass see I don't know but I wanted to be prepared I have two more little baby gadget things to show you guys and then we'll move on to clothes so next thing that I registered for is another hatch baby so this is a hatch baby rest we use it for Alethea and I knew I wanted to get one from him it's the best and I think it's so worth it guys I know it's a little bit pricier but it's just the aesthetic of it it's very minimal very clean very simple I love that you can control it from your phone I love all the different features that it has like the fact that it has like an actual sound machine but then the rice to wake and you can do the lights and I love the sounds that it has so I knew I wanted to get one for him as well and with the baby class that we follow for sleep training it you need a sound machine so I knew I wanted to get this one last baby thing is for the bathtub and this is a flower blooming what is this called it's like a flower bed thing for them to bathe inside up so when Alethea was born she was 6 pounds I don't suspect him to be as small as she was but the first couple of weeks are very very difficult to bait them because they're so small and so tiny what I actually ended up doing for the first couple of weeks is using those towels that they give you at the hospital the ones that are like blue and pink and I would fill our sink with those and then wrap her in a towel and then put her in there just she was like warm and cozy because we had this other one and I'll insert a picture which I still have and will use but for those first couple of weeks when they're just so small and so fragile you don't want them like touching anything cold so I've seen many people rave about this so you basically put it inside of your sink and they kind of just sit in it I'm probably gonna have to watch a video on how to like actually do this cuz this is actually pretty big I don't know how effective this will be now that I think about it cuz it's so big but it's really soft so we'll see I have to like look up videos look like how to use this but I'm pretty sure you just put it in your sink fill it up with water and then like the baby just like sits in here so I'm excited about this because I remember how like terrifying it was giving ilithyia about the first couple of weeks because she was so little oh wait sorry last thing last thing um is this changing pad thingy basket so I plan on putting his dresser right over there and I wanted it to be a smaller dresser and I was gonna have this to untap and be his little changing pad so I found this on Etsy I will link it below but I think it's so pretty it has like this leather detailing on it and it's like a really good size it's like the same size as Alethea's normal changing pad so I'm excited about this and it actually came with the little thing inside of it so I appreciate that and I think this is just so now that we got those those little gadgets out of the way obviously that's not all I'm gonna use for him I am gonna do another video preparing it for baby boy then I will show you guys other things that I'm gonna use such as like the mama Roo and like other random things that I have I would show you guys the bassinet that I ordered that was so cute and rattan that I found at cratenbarrel I ordered it back in March I'm supposed to be here last week but now it's not getting delivered until he's born which is making me a little bit nervous because the bassinet is crucial because I won't Co sleep and I don't know what to do so yeah that's a dilemma but I'll put a picture here cuz it's really cute and I love it and I can't wait until it gets here and I really pray and hope it gets here ovaries board okay alright should I show you guys his bringing home outfit I think this is what I want him to come home in I know I want him to wear this hat at the hospital at some point goodness so I found this on Etsy it's so cute this makes me want to cry with how small this is so I found it on Etsy it's handmade it came from I want to say New Zealand I can't remember but I know I want him to wear some type of little hat normally in the hospital they do have them wearing cats anyway because they have a hard time regulating their temperature so with the Lai Thea I used top nuts because they're so cute and for him I'm not gonna have him work at night so I was like oh I want to get him a little hat so I found this little guy that he'll probably be wearing for the first couple of weeks I he's born depending on the temperature but I know definitely in the hospital he'll be wearing this and it is just so small and so cute so I'll link this down below but I'm still deciding which will be his bringing home outfit first I have this one that is from spearmint love and it is the softest material ever it's this really pretty blue color I can't believe that babies are this small like I'm forgetting how small they are so I really like this or I was thinking about this outfit right here with you guys you're gonna cry look at this oh are you kidding look okay so these are my colors if you can't tell I really like the mustards I really like the Blues I really like the creams that's just like what I've been gravitating towards so we'll see how big he is cuz this is a little bit larger so if he's a little bit chunkier then he'll fit in this but if he's a little bit smaller he'll fit in this either way I look so cute with these with the little hat so these are two things that I got a lot of his stuff is from hmm I love hmm for a newborn that's where I got all of Alethea stuff when she was born because they have really small sizing and very particular sizing so it goes like newborn 0 to 1 1 to 2 2 to 3 or 2 to 4 something like that like it's very specific and like micro so it was very convenient and easy to shop for because like he was really tiny his grandma got him these overalls which like come on so cute so the thing that I'm a little conflicted on is like what dress him in because we live in Michigan and it's summertime but our Michigan weather has been so bad lately like it's mid-may right now and we have yet to have like a hot day or like a nice day it's super gloomy right now so I don't know I had Alethea in February so she was always dressed super-duper-duper layered and warm and cozy so I'm not sure if I'm just gonna have him in a onesie all day or like a one not one see these are PJs I don't know if I'll have him in just like a one-piece or he'll like be wearing pants I'm not sure if you guys have had babies in the summer but not brutally hot summers let me know what it is that you dress your babies in because I'm not sure like what to really stock up on I guess I'm just gonna wait a little bit like I said I have a lot of clothes from Malaysia so I'll probably just wait and see like what we end up going through more frequently but these are just do q I can't handle it speaking of you know it being summer also go on my hat don't it up how are you kidding me I could not Oh hats are just like my favorite thing ever and it's gonna be so weird not like accessorizing him because I'm so used to like over accessorizing Alethea with earrings and necklaces and bracelets and bows it's gonna be so weird to me to like just put like just the shirt on him so I kind of went overboard with the hats but I love this so much again then his grandma got him the shoes - just a little soup for the feets you know okay last thing aren't these swaddles earth I think one is a swaddle yes this is a swaddle um very lightweight swaddle this is from sallee baby I've actually never had anything from them when a lady was a baby but I'm excited I heard really good things about them so I got this cream-colored one just like a normal Seidel and then I got an actual rap and I'm so excited about this cuz this color is beautiful and like I mentioned in my video about like things I'm doing different with baby boy one thing I want to do and be more aware of myself and more conscious of doing is wearing him and wrapping him so I loved wrapping the lay Thea that's how I would leave the house with her for church I would wear her the entire time any time we went out like the first three months of her life any time we went in public I would wrap her and wear her so people wouldn't touch her so I'm gonna do the same thing with him but obviously I don't think we'll be going out but more so if we go on walks or whatever I will wear and wrap him and this color is just so pretty and just literally matches and goes with everything else that I got so that is my haul I wish I had more to show you guys but honestly I don't if you want me if you guys want to see the other stuff that I have from Alethea that I will be using for him let me know and I can include it in like a vlog within the next couple of weeks and stuff and I'm gonna do another video again like I said just showing you guys the things I'm bringing out from Alethea that I'll have for him like the mama Roo and like what I'm doing to prep my house to bring a newborn in so hope you guys enjoy this video in this haul I'll be linking everything it down below as well I love you guys so much I hope you have a wonderful week and I'll see you in my next video bye hey guys welcome it to our master room tour video okay let's let's start so it's a quarantine to get me to finish this room because a lot of the pieces that we had was from our previous house so it was a little bit hard to like accommodate for this room because it was a little bit larger right off the bat right over here this is my little self in there I get questions about it all the time it is from Ikea it's like the perfect length I don't believe they still have this color but they do have like other types and it's very affordable so definitely check out IKEA whenever they open and then right over here we have our closet and I actually have like an entire highlight in my Instagram story of how I organized my closet because I did it like like a month ago and I've been able to maintain it so it still looks the same like these are still well organized so I'll link that down below if you guys want to see that and then this corner I have my little wall hat wall so this thing I found at Hobby Lobby and honestly I have no idea what it's even intended for but when I saw it I was like that would be perfect to hang hats so I have seen it at hobby lobby before quarantine they still had it but you can easily DIY it cuz it's honestly just beads and then like this little clips what are these called like those clothes things yeah so it's literally just that and like clothes pins and it just holds my hats now all of them more of them or downstairs but this is it like adds like a little detail of stuff but it's also practical alright moving along this way we have our nightstands sojourned I both have matching nightstands these are from Wayfarer and I love them because they're really big in the drawers just like fit so much not that like you need that much at your night scene I just like feel like it's a nice statement piece and the back actually has these USB ports so you can just connect to your phone right on to the nightstand and not into the wall which is very convenient if you have like a shorter cord and then the stuff that I have over here is basically everything from Studio Mickey versus target so they collabed and I love Studio McGee but honestly her stuff is very expensive so when she said she was gonna be collabing with target and it would be more affordable pieces that I could finally buy something from her so I was so excited so this is from there Jordan I both have them and then the mirrors are from there as well these exact mirrors we have in our bathroom downstairs too so a lot of this stuff is from that collection and I just loved how affordable it was and I just like love the pieces together and I tried to keep our nightstand as minimal as possible just because I feel like we have a lot of stuff going on with the bed and everything else that I kept it very minimal with the vases inside so moving along this way we have my dresser so I actually bought this gesture before Jordan and I got married and she's so old like SuperDuper old I bet she's like from the 80s or something so when I originally got her she was like a deep blue color which I really liked but I thought she was made out of hardwood and a couple weeks ago I thought it'd be a fun project to like strip her and bring out her like natural wood and like refinish her turns out she wasn't even made out of real wood so it was particle board yeah and I it like looked like it would have been real wood cuz it's so old and it's so heavy so that was a little upsetting but the the drawer faces these are written wood right here yeah and some parts of the framing but the top part this is all particle board and the bottoms particle board so it was kind of a disappointment yeah I thought I was gonna like refurbish and like redo this beautiful old piece of antique or something but that didn't end up happening so temporarily we are having her in here we just painted her like a clean color so this isn't finished as far as like this whole side go but then again on this part we just put really minimal things books vases accessories and then these guys are here Jordan actually got them from inside of the road for me because we have these all over Michigan it's like we eat it basically but it's really pretty so I had him bring scissors and you cut them up for me for our bed now I get questions about it all the time and the actual life bed and everything they don't have anymore but I have one that I've linked that's very very similar and I actually don't want to keep this bed I really want a canopy bed and I say that as I smile I get joy there because he is not about it but I think it would look so pretty and there's one that I've been eyeing but it's I'm backorder so I'm like patiently waiting to see when it'll come back in stock if it ever comes back in stock so anyway so we have a king-sized bed I love having a king-sized bed we had a queen when we first got married but with two big dogs it just does not work so I love the king and then for our sheets so we get questions about this all the time but when we first got married we got our sheets from Brooklyn in and I even worked with them a lot and I liked their stuff but then we had them for two years and then they started to like completely fall apart and like rip like we had like a giant hole like I'm Jordan side remember there's like a huge hole like this day and it's not like we're worth being and tearing it apart so it's a little disappointing to say that the quality didn't last that long so we recently got new ones and these are from a company called attitude and they're the softest thing ever it's made out of what bamboo and it's so nice so I definitely suggest getting those because I just love the clean white look and we wash our sheets once a week to keep it nice and clean but yeah I love white bedding and then our pillows so three big guys in the back the dark brown ones are from Target and then these two lo the two little ones and the long one are from home goods okay so then this is jordyn side we have like matching stuff I just have like a couple of again minimal things smaller things and then we have this plant that I love if you think it's such a statement piece it's from Target and it was very affordable for the size that it is and then right beneath you guys we have our dog bed and this thing is huge you guys know that our dogs sleep with us so honestly it's kind of pointless to have it here but I tried to make it all pretty and put like a little pillow over it a blanket so blob look nice and charming look up one lipstick on your nose sorry alright and then over here in this corner it's like a little reading nook area I recently did this I've logged all about it but I got these old artworks that are pieces that are in museums so I followed a blog post that chris loves julia did I'll link them down below they're one of my favorite designers on Instagram and she did a blog post on how you can easily get artwork for free like this so I went on to the Smithsonian website and I just like searched for hours honestly like I spent a very long time trying to find these art pieces but they're whole database is like completely free and you are able to do whatever you want with that artwork so I searched for like different portraits different flowers villages I like wanted something kind of Moody and vampy and dark over here so after that you can basically just download it and print it off it wherever you want we printed off at like Walmart or something and then I just got some frames and it was a very affordable way to get some really nice art pieces so I'll leave a link to her blog post down below if you guys want to try it out too did you say vampy and dark yeah what does that mean like vampirish know like movie this dude looks like a vampire yeah it's like moody like so does she it's like called like dorky stuff I didn't want like super bright and airy ended up that was like the vibe I was going over here I don't like it you it's not I'd like some biblical paintings please I tried finding some okay so you don't know where Christians case you forgot I tried finding some but they honestly did not match all right and then down over here this will be very very quick this is our bathroom and my rule for decorating this bathroom was to make sure everything that I used for decor was functional so on my side I have my best salts my perfumes and like my jewelry and everything and I made sure that it was all practical things so like my daily jewelry that I take on and off I keep over there in that corner but also looks cute say most like this middle piece my sister actually drew this like by hand and then draw it inside this is actually a piece of my bouquet so I dried it out and I have many pieces of it throughout the entire house that I used for decor so if any of you are getting married I highly suggest to keep your bouquet flip it upside down and dry it out and then you can use it for decor so it's such like a cute little element but reminds me then we just have our bathtub and shower again I wanted to keep things practical so up here we have like our extra towels my dry brush normally have bath salts in here and then that stuff is more for decor but still I tried my best and then I have my little plant bag in here he is thriving in here because he gets really good sunlight and he's just the cutest and then this rug is from Thursday I wanted more of like a statement piece because everything is so neutral I wanted any old rug in here so we switched out the hardware over there too by the way yes and I'll try to link that they're not this was so hard to do because nothing matched with anything and nothing with the set so I'll try my best to link all of those pieces down below so if it we'd DIY doll so we just kind of it was Chrome so we kind of scratched and buffed the surface so be like more hard and then we spray painted with like a waterproof speaking anything with these so black was not an option when we built the house or was it no they just had oil rubbed bronze which is very similar but it's got like the corn gee-ya color to it so we wanted it all black so I will try to link these down below and then our light fixture I will link as well and last thing that I forgot to mention it was about our rug so we recently added this in and I really really like it it's from rugs USA I believe so it was a very affordable option and I just like love the blue it honestly wasn't meant to be blue follow me on Instagram when I first got it I was shocked because in the picture it looked brown and ivory and then a person it's like blue green but I think it fits really well in this room so that is our room tour I will try my best to link everything it down below and if you don't see a link to something it's probably because it's either from the thrift store or home goods because you know how home goods is like it's hard to link everything so oh wait lassy my juju hat so Jordan was not about this to do hat guys because it just it's like made out of feathers it is handmade this one came from Africa I found it on Etsy and it's just such a beautiful piece I love the texture and the elements of it it's just very unexpected so I won't link her down below as well but I think she's beautiful it's called a juju hat I get questions about it a lot and yeah that's what it's called it's just basically just like a round thing made out of feathers but it's really pretty and big statement piece so I hope you guys enjoyed this room tour and I see you in my next video bye hi guys good morning I'm gonna have a baby in three weeks in three days I feel like I start off every video like this but it truly does not feel like we should be having a baby right now like I know I'm out of breath I know I'm like wheezing and feeling ginormous but like today I am going to be going around the house and like digging up our basement so do you know where the mama roux is or the bassinet or like any I know where it is do you yeah it's downstairs are we gonna have to like search and search or is it like right out and open so I want to like take all the baby stuff out that we previously had with lazy AB pull it out I want to put like the mama Roo down here somewhere but I will talk about the elephant in the room and that is my hair I tried so hard not to say anything on Instagram but like literally my DMS we're blowing because you guys noticed I didn't think it would be that drastic of a change because I've been trying to like not go blonde but I've been trying to light in my hair since I was pregnant with Alethea actually so when I was nine months probably eight months pregnant with her I started putting blonde in my hair so if you watched my old old old videos my hair was like very dark I would die a very dark color I mean this is my natural color but I would die a little bit darker than that I didn't want any dimension no color I just loved like the straight brown and I do like that but I wanted to do something different so I started transitioning and to lightening up my hair when I was 9 months pregnant with the late eight months right sorry you can't be nine months pregnant right cuz when you're nine months pregnant that didn't you give birth yeah so sorry I'm sweating I've been transitioning my hair and I go and get it done every three to four months and she'll just like slowly add more color to it I didn't want to damage my hair and my hair stylist is amazing works from home so I've always gone to her house and I was afraid of saying anything online because I was afraid of getting backlash with people thinking I went to a salon to get my hair done so and I don't know if anyone else feels like this but I really feel like I can't say anything about quarantine or like literally anything because people just like attack you for everything so I've just been like more on the DL I always gotta have my hair done at her house so she I just went to her house like normal and she's very cautious about everything like she's very professional we were both wearing masks and got I got it yes so it did do it yesterday what else did I say I was gonna do oh I wanted to actually clean the stroller itself yeah just cuz there's like so many crumbs and like it's all nasty and the last time I actually watched the entire stroll it like took it apart and everything was when we went to Disney which was back in February so it's been a long time since it's it cleaned so it needs a corona cleaning yes it does here is my thirty-six week bump bump date very large and in charge show yours off too as far as like my stretch marks go don't know if you can really see them but because I have a tan right now I don't think you can but they're all just like right here in this area don't mind it I feel like it'll just go back to normal anyway but there you go big old belly Oh   I've just been doing it some organizing and cleaning at my face it's really guys I am so sweaty I don't know how people live in like humid states cuz it's like the first time it's been 80 degrees outside of Michigan in a very long time and I am just losing it olivia is still napping so I think she's gonna end up taking a 3-hour nap with him is it oh it is 12:30 right now so Joe and I did some emails we got a couple phone calls all night work stuff it's situated and then I cleaned the mom room and I did some laundry I'm waiting to watch like the actual mama Roo cover we're like the baby actually lays because that's washable which is really convenient but I thought I'd show you guys baby boys nursery so honestly not much has changed in here this is what it looks like so I mentioned in my first baby nursery video that I did that I did not want a rocking chair I did not use it at all with Olivia I would rather have a bed to be able to just lay down and lodge and relax with him so I got this one from a world market and everything else is basically the same that is not going to stay there what I'm gonna do is put a dresser right here which will have his changing table and then on this wall right here this all is coming out and his crib will go right here so I'm still just waiting on things to come in and I actually decided that I'm going to repaint this a lighter color because it's a little bit too orange and I wanted the main color in his room to be green like an olive green color so I don't know what I'm gonna do that but it's gonna be easy cuz I'm literally just gonna follow the exact strokes that I did and I know I'm so indecisive I've been putting together a couple of things for my house a little bit because this time around I'm gonna have to a lot more because we are not allowed to leave so once we get there and we are in our room we cannot go anywhere else so I need to make sure that whatever I have is what I need so it's very different from the first time with ilithyia I was very minimal I didn't pack a lot of stuff I tried to keep it very limited but this time I'm gonna over pack a ton because I don't know how long we're gonna end up being there and I don't know what's gonna happen food is closed so we're gonna bring a cooler with like snacks and fruits and like things and meals because when you're in the hospital they feed the mom they don't not feed the dad so last time what Jordan did is who just get takeout or his mom would bring him food or something but this time he can't do that so I've been slowly I have just like a small basket right here but slowly adding things of like what I want to bring so the sound machine I asked you guys on Instagram actually and a lot of you said that you brought a sound machine the first time I didn't I brought one too but I wanted to make sure I didn't forget I have binky's I have like random clothes that I've actually already washed for him so these are just a couple of like little outfits and then another thing that I'm bringing this time around are face masks and the company John Yoo is working on today's video with me so as you guys know right now a lot of states are requiring you to wear masks anytime you are in public and with the hospital I have to wear mask the entire time that I am there so I wanted to make sure that I had one acute mask but then also a practical mask that works so they have tons and tons of different colors and different sizes they have both adult and children I'm not having a lengthy aware mask but it's nice to know that they have that possibility so there's different colors and different prints so this one it's a really pretty floral print I like this one a lot it finds the little ones so this one is just in a black this is for like the babies but then for me I got these for Jordan ID to wear in the house so I wanted to get reusable ones like this because once you're done using you can just throw it in the wash so I really wanted to be able to have tons of them available to Jordan I because like I've been saying this entire video I've been getting really sweaty so I wanted to have like a large collection of them so I can just switch them out and not be wearing the same one for like the entire time that I'm at the hospital because I feel like that would get really gross and you're breathing that and it's just that so I like the ability to be able to just wash get new ones and you're not wasting as much either so these are super durable very comfortable - I love the material it doesn't I don't know there's been other ones that I've tried that I just really don't like how it feels on your face and this one is just very soft very comfortable janou has donated over a million masks to different companies so they donated to baby to baby the LA Children's Hospital and the LA family housing project which i think is amazing so I just love working with companies that are supporting and helping people during these crazy times I'm gonna leave a link down below if you guys would like to shop at jvcom and get yourself some face masks I also love that it comes in two little patches so I'm ringing these for Jordan and I and then this one more for me to wear but I want to have a lot just to be safe and just to make sure that we are covered and I'm gonna wash all of those and then also another thing that I don't want to forget is compression sacks for myself so I was so so so so swollen after giving birth and my legs like my knees like my whole leg was just so swollen so this time I'm gonna bring a compression sacks and then I also placed an order on Amazon actually with a couple of things that I bought for myself postpartum so this time around I actually bought underwear they're not postpartum underwear I'll show you pictures them but they're like high-waisted underwear they look like this this is what they look like so I place like a huge order of like random is that I felt like I needed for myself and that was one of them I do here lay Thea though she's up from her nap so she could select almost a full three hours which is great   my baby did you poop with my bracelets Oh God you have already you already have your bracelets yeah you have yours on let's leave this in occur yeah we're not happy we have it when we nap know what you want me to change you she doesn't like to be change so she'll just snuggle me because she knows I love to snuggle with her and I won't put her down if she is so since the pandemic started we have been having a harder time finding diapers and I bought the love diapers because that's what I used to use on the girl I used to nanny when I was a nanny before I had Alethea and I liked them and they worked really well but they changed their like formula or whatever like they changed the way they make their diapers now and they are horrible like every time I change her diaper she leaks every morning she's been leaking or her diaper just falls off the other day she was wearing like normal pajamas and she was walking and I looked at her leg in her life look really fat and I was like what the heck and I felt her butt and I could feel her bare butt and her diapers like on her leg so all that to say that I really miss my Huggies cuz that's the diaper that we know our youth haha Huggies hug yeah those are our favorite diapers but because we bought a box of the love's we're trying to just like go through them and use them up but Huggies are my favorite so for baby boy I'm getting Huggies diapers is that you yeah I can't show you my no no no it's where's your nose yeah ears ice yeah nice you feel my eyelashes if you feel funny birthday long your like my eyelashes yeah I put mascara on them and it makes them super long where's my mouth yeah let's change your diapers it's so stinky yeah yeah only if you got her first booboo ever it's right over here actually her first booboo ever right set your first booboo yeah she got really excited she got really excited the other day when we were going on a walk and she ran in like scraped her knees so with quarantine it's been really hurt and one thing is that I so I introduced coloring to her when she was about a year old she's trying again they can't with you me sittin you jerk but she still hadn't really figured she could hold it but she couldn't figure out how to like mark on the paper yeah so I would keep out yeah what know what okay so I would still keep it out and let her explore with it but then I found that these markers by Crayola they're called color wonder and it only shows up on this specific paper and it's actually really cool so she can walk around with the markers but this won't show up on your skin it won't show up on fabric it won't show up on the wall will show up anywhere except physics special papers so I've gotten her a couple of different kinds we have a baby shark one that she's like obsessed with it's really cool like when you do it it like takes like a second to show up again it shows up I'm gonna come color and this is like her favorite activity ever so this table and chair set is from Ikea it's super affordable I believe it was just 20 to 30 dollars and then like I said that is from the thrift store and then over here in this little caddy is where I keep the actual like paper for her to use so these stackable bins I found at Target but it's great because she'll come over here she'll grab one she'll put it up here she doesn't know how to open the markers just yet so she'll bring them to me and then I'll open them and then she can just go and do her own thing but she does know how to she does know how to go up on the chair by herself that's really cute so so not only stay here for a good 10-15 minutes just doing oh yeah okay she always says that we've always said that Melanie looks like a mallanna yeah and that's what she says so Nanette is my sister's nickname it means baby in Portuguese and she always points at Moana and says minute because she thinks it's my sister hey who's that you want to sit up in your chair you're not gonna sit in your chair okay we don't have to sit we can stand in color open I'm gonna open it for you all right it is lunchtime now throw it and just made us some food so Olivia loves olives so do I so we'll always make like some type of version of like a caprese salad caprese caprese a however people say it this time Jordan put tomatoes mozzarella red onion which is a game-changer and then olives and then balsamic drizzle and olive oil and salt so that's what we're eating she I always give her like tons of extra olives because that's like her favorite thing ever and then we warmed up leftovers that we had a couple nights ago which is this rice and chicken and Alethea is eating the exact same thing she loves food so she's at this phase right now where she knows exactly what she wants but she doesn't have the verb virtual communication like the language all the way so what shins up doing is going ah which you know is so good to hear all day long so I'm trying really hard together yeah like that I'm trying to help her expand her vocabulary so I try to help her like say what it is I tell her what the word is but then also what I've been doing because I feel like mainly she says ah because she wants to get my attention and because she's trying to figure out what it is that she wants yeah so um instead of her screaming at me telling her to say please in sign language so please in sign languages like this she doesn't do a circle she goes like this so I've been trying to get her to do this please cuz then I'll pay attention to her and then I'll tell her oh like please you want chicken here please can I have my fork or whatever so we're just like at this stage right now everything is just constant yeah this is fine is that through it but my mom and sister here we played it outside with ilithyia for a little bit in the water but it is just so hot so we actually brought her down for a nap so we've been trying to change this in her out of that second nap because she wasn't taking it but because we were out in the Sun and playing in water and stuff she is a little sleepy I don't think she's sleeping cuz I could hear her talking but I think she's having quiet time and I just told my mom I'm bored because I've already done everything I need to do today so I'm gonna get my body ready for labor you know their baths on my yoga ball my belly has not dropped yet right mom he hasn't dropped yeah so he hasn't dropped yet at this point in my pregnancy with Lina she had already dropped so not that I'm trying to like rush him because I'm not but but at the same time I am trying to make my labor as smooth as possible and like kind of get things rolling so I'm just gonna bounce on the ball for a little bit there's no harm in doing that and hopefully I'll be able to like start walking outside I do walk with the lady and her mole in the mornings but those aren't like actual walks we're not really actively walking so off to bounce welcome from burnout come here okay so yeah come here you giant mr. Newton whoa you my goldfish do you call me look at her mom she brings me the goldfish and her cup she's living the best life she walked over there with her snack and she wanted to sit in there and she's looking out the window she loves to look out this window cuz we always have like birds and squirrels and stuff so she's just are you living your best life yeah you look so big in there   yom-yom Go Fish   well Jordan I feel like we're in high school again my mom just took a leak good to go have a sleepover in her house and my sister went there too so it's just Jordan tonight and the pups would be in high school like well I guess premiere marriage like preview newlywed yeah really we're newlyweds we don't know what to do so my mom has been taking a lengthy for sleepovers like every other week and they miss her okay well we're gonna go relive our newlywed days and have fun okay guys good morning welcome back to today's vlog I'm so excited but honestly I come with you with a heavy heart because of everything that's going on right now and I couldn't sleep last night I just had like this urge and need to just pray and I literally prayed myself to sleep last night it's just really hard that this is the world that we live in right now and I know so many people are hurting and it's just very sickening and sad and you can't ignore what's going on that's like the biggest thing is like you cannot tell me that this is not a problem like it's just beyond me so I'm going to link some resources down below for you guys if you guys want to donate or just call I want to do something because I feel like there's just so many people not doing anything you're not talking about it enough and really just can't get it out of my mind and like I said last night I just was praying for hours guys like I could not fall asleep last night I just feel like there's a lot of stuff going on right now in spiritual realm and just in our world obviously but I will leave it some resources down below and if you guys have any ideas or any other resources that I might not have linked down below please comment them I don't mean to start off this video like this because I do want my channel and my platform to always be kind of like an escape and a place where you guys can escape those certain things but sometimes those things cannot be escaped and we can't avoid them I just feel so helpless and hopeless because I feel like I'm so limited of what I can do so if you guys have any ideas or any resources or anything that please comment those down below because we need to just come together and stop this because it's just absurd so I am 37 weeks today and my tummy dropped a couple of days ago and I'm feeling like he's gonna come early and I say that only because my body just seems to be ready so at 36 weeks and five days I went into my OB and she checked me and she said I was too meters dilated now that could mean that my body is slowly progressing or my body could just sit at 2 centimeters for the next three weeks and we might not have a baby until the due date or whatever with that I'm not exactly sure I mean I like wish I always say this adjourn and I'm like I wish the Lord would let us know at least just the day the baby is gonna come so we can better prepare ourselves I told you and I was like I would not be surprised if he's here by next weekend again I don't know I don't know but something inside of me tells me he's gonna come earlier so I'm very excited because you guys know if you've watched any of my recent videos I've been talking about how unprepared I've been feeling because I don't have his room done I don't have anything in there I don't have a crib it'll have a best net I don't have any of that because of kovat and just like delays and shipping but yesterday my IKEA package came in so his dresser came in as well as his crib so today's vlog I am going to be painting those and putting those together and just kind of like completing his room so I'm very excited it's been like a nice distraction having that and I just like love to paint so I'm gonna go out into the garage and show you guys what I got and the coloring painting it and oh I also repainted his room look I'll show you guys that first then I'll show you the other stuff but all right so my sister and I repainted this wall we basically just made the lines right over what it already was but I got more of a muted tone because the orange was just a little bit too vibrant and with the green I'm gonna use with the rest of the room it just would have clashed so I like the way that this looks a lot better but over here I have this wall where I'm going to put a shelf so it's not gonna be a floating shelf that's gonna be a hanging shelf so I just went to Lowe's and gotten supplies for that but I'm also going to be painting that which I'll show you downstairs and then his dresser is gonna go over here and then his crib will go right over here       it's already you think so well Jordan I just built something together and we're still married so that's good it's only strengthen their relationship hi guys good morning it's the next day I haven't even said hello yet yesterday I keep like underestimated how long these projects are gonna take but Jordan I just finished the shelf and he actually just hung it up so it gathered up a couple of things that I want to use to put here I obviously want to put very like cute nursery things so yesterday when I went to pick up the paint actually picked up these three little packs so I'm going to put those and then the thing that you guys keep hearing is this really cute little elephant that Jordan's aunt got for him I don't know how to shut it off so it like keeps like playing the song which I love the little fun it makes it's so cute look at that and then I got one of these beads that I have left over from my Amazon haul if you guys watched it video I talked about how like I didn't have anything to use this for so I'll say followed rate but or something I don't know I'm gonna play with it I also have this plant from Ikea that I just like from downstairs I have this picture frame that has currently ilithyia's foot in it but I think I'll play his ultrasound in here or maybe even his handprint or foot or something and then I actually got tons of books from the laziest collections of like really cute classic ones that I love so the quiet book where the wild things are so there's Noah's Ark bunnies playtime daddy loves me and then a frog thing I used to read this to ilithyia so many times a day when she was a baby baby she still loved this book so I'm excited I'm gonna try to like see what I can do and come up with but let me show you what it looks like right now okay so this is kind of like right when you walk in through the door so this is kind of what you see so his crib will be right here and then that's where we decided to put it so it is over a little bit more because we're gonna have curtains so I wanted to make sure to have a room for that but I think it's gonna be a nice little touch on at the wall so let me add this stuff real quick   all right this is what I've come up with so far I feel like I want to keep it more minimal I'm not sure how I feel about that or about that but my mom is coming over like later this week so I'll ask her and she'll probably end up rearranging it for me anyway oh wait let me get some cute shoes let me get shoes shoes are always really cute for decor I just changed that so I've made this up then I put the little shoe and then I put the little beaded thing over there so I think that looks a little bit better again I'll wait till my mama comes over and she'll help me figure it out but I love the way that this look right miss Alesia woke up so we took a short little break but look what we brought up this little dresser this dresser is from Ikea it's what I had been waiting for and it's what I was painting and then I just added the changing table on top and then and then we're either gonna put that mirror here or a black one I'm not sure yet I'm gonna see what I can find the only thing about that mirror is that it's not a lot of mirror it's a lot of like wood on the outside and Miss Olivia is very needy today there is very she's having a sad day again my sister and I are also going to hang a couple of things up here well not hang but put picture frames so I spent a couple of hours on Pinterest last night just finding PDFs so normally I will like create my own art and design and stuff but on Pinterest or not on Pinterest on Etsy I was able to find some for like $3 there's just like downloadable PDFs so these are the ones so these are the ones I found so it's like a very similar green so I'm gonna get a rainbow a little whale there's an ABC one and then this is the last one that I found that I thought was really cute so so we'll do a couple prints of those off and many other ones I will just do myself my sister's gonna help me to maybe even put like one with his ultrasound or maybe like his hand when he's born more like personal little cute things so my camera is about to die so I'm gonna go charge it real quick but tonight we have my maternity shoe which I'm really excited about and very happy that we're gonna be able to do so I will check back in with you guys once I start getting ready for that and getting everything ready but little do we this looks and I am gonna put knobs or not not so I'm actually gonna put a pole so there's a hole here and a hole right here so I'm going to put one giant one it's not gonna be black it's gonna be I think it was called it's like an antique black or something or gunmetal black so it's not like a starless I think it's a little bit lighter than that it's gonna be more like kind of a grey hint to it so we'll see   you're such a min.i you figure it out yeah okay here are the outfit options so just this is like such a last-minute thing basically that's her dress and then her dress from her birthday so for this white one I was gonna wear this pink dress and then for this dress of Alethea's I was going to wear this dress and then for this green dress ilithyia's gonna wear her birthday dress   the   okay so we just finished the shoot and I think that's probably the most special photo shoot I've ever had because I missile a theof Air Jordan obviously my eyelashes are like starting to come off I haven't like put eyelashes on in so long but estra did such a good job and you feel like for a last-minute suit like this dress that I'm wearing is from Myer which is a local grocery store here in Michigan but the weather was like perfect it's kind of cold out it's like in the 60s and I will post all of those pictures on Instagram if I have any by the time I add up this video and I'll insert some of the pictures here but that was so fun and I'm so excited I feel like the past couple of days have really like been sitting and like hitting home of like him being here and him being here soon I don't know why it's just been so much harder for me to wrap my mind around having another baby I definitely think it's because of quarantine and the pandemic like it just hasn't really felt like life has been real recently so this has been very like I'm gonna have a baby boy soon and I'm so excited so I hope you guys enjoyed today's vlog and we're heading home now it's like it's almost almost 9 o'clock so I will link ester down below she's done literally every single one of my shoots ever I only trust her with my pictures she's amazing so I will link her down below she's in Michigan but she's also willing to travel but I hope you guys enjoyed today's video and hopefully soon we'll be having my labor video going up bye guys hey guys welcome to my channel or welcome back if you've been here many times before today's video I'm going to be packing my past boy bag as well as my son's bag and everything that I am bringing so this is my second baby so I have done this before and I took lots of notes of what I wish I would have brought the first time and what I wish I wouldn't have brought the first time my biggest tip for any of you mamas out there is for you to have everything packed before hand now that means everything so buy duplicates of things even if you might have it in your house so for me I was like I'm gonna save money I'm gonna cut on cost I don't want to buy any toiletries I'm just gonna pack my own toiletries the night before like I'll do all of that before I go to the hospital like it'll be easy to just grab my laptop and grab these little things well when my water ended up breaking I was packing for a full two hours before we were able to leave for the hospital because I had so many of these little mech last-minute things that I just said that I would write on a list and I would bring with me and then I ended up forgetting quite a few things and I ended up just stressing myself out because I was packing for a full two hours guys my water broke around 1 a.m. we think it's a hospital until 4:00 because I was putting things together and just like bringing this and putting this in there and doing that so my biggest tip for you is to pack your hospital bag but like actually have it packed I don't know if that like is common sense but for me I just had a lot of like miscellaneous items that I was using and would be using until I gave birth then I decided to not pack or buy duplicates of and I wish I would have done that that is my biggest take away with you guys I'll be sharing tons of tips and tons of things that I wish I would have had and what I'm gonna be bringing why I'm bringing it all that stuff but you like this video make sure you give it a thumbs up and subscribe down below so you don't miss out on my labor delivery vlog and let's get started what I'm doing differently this time is I'm only bringing it myself this weekender bag that's from Fond design and for him I'm actually putting all of his needs and all of his things in his diaper bag so I'm killing two birds with one stone here because I won't need a diaper bag and another bag for him and like his hospital ease things what I learned that the first time around is that it will give you plenty of diapers and wipes so I am bringing some diapers and I am reading wipes but just this there's like eight in here or something so it's a very small stack I love these wipes they're from Amazon I have gotten these for Alethea for so long I love them I get them shipped to my house I get like a box so it's like a box of six I think and I get them shipped to my house every other month and I've never ran out of wipes and I love these a lot they're my favorite wipes these are the sensitive ones very affordable and I never have to like think about my wipes because I just get them delivered stuff it's great I'm also bringing some hand sanitizer as well and then for him I'm bringing him two blankets so it's Alethea the first time around I brought her so many blankets I don't know why I like was obsessed with the blankets that I had but honestly you don't need that many so I'm just bringing to these this one is very very lightweight very breathable it's like a muslin cloth style I can use it to cover his car seat ringing these two and they smell so good all of this has already been washed the way next thing I'm ringing is a swaddle I have never used this model before it's by a company called miracle baby I got it on Amazon I don't know how to use it just yet this is a little bit different than what I've been used to with the Leigh Thea it like actually has like different scenes and stuff it's not just like a normal swaddle so I'm gonna have to bring the instructions for that but I am going to bring this because babies love to be swaddled aleisea loved being swaddled and I know I'm gonna be smuggling him moving on to clothes I'm keeping it very simple and very basic last time was aleisea I brought clothes that were too big so I bought newborn clothes and then I brought zero to three months but honestly guys when they come fresh out of the room they are so like skinny and tiny at least my babies are and so I'm not going to bring any zero to three month clothes I'm only gonna bring a newborn clothes and based off the way that my tummy looks right now he's not gonna be a super large baby so I am going to bring just two outfits that are zero to three that are a little bit bigger but the rest of them will be important so I'm ringing three new born lenses that are long-sleeved I am bringing it to newborn that our short sleeve that I'm ringing a little zip up onesie little PJ I have another one but it's currently in the wash because it like didn't dry properly you little pairs of pants one little outfit that is so cute and then two hats so these are just so cute babies when they're in the hospital they're always wearing hats on their heads just because they need to help regulate their temperature so I got this one and then this one my friend Esther gave to me that I'll try to link these down below but hats are a must another thing I mean we're in aren't pinkies these are from a company called bibs these are the ones that la Thea really likes so I did get him a couple I also already have it on a clip because clips are lifesavers if your baby uses pasties you need to have Clips because it's just gonna make your life so much easier and then I am going to bring another pair of pacifiers that's from Ryan and Rose just in case he doesn't like these or these are too big or whatever I am gonna bring just another pair just to be safe and then last thing for him are these plus I use birth clots a lot with Elysia I know they'll have some at the hospital but I want to be able to have some just in my bag for whenever we head home if we're in the car and he like sits up or whatever you know things don't always go to plan so I just want to have those as extra in there so this all will fit I'm actually debating if I should put all of these in like a ziploc bag and like airtight it and like conceal it so it fits better in here we'll see but this bag does hold a lot but I just don't want things to get disorganized so that's all I'm rating for him any aunt Minnie any of my hospital had the first time around so I'm not bringing those I'm delivering him at the same place that I delivered lay Theo so I feel like I kind of have a good I have a good understanding of like how much they give you so this is his bag right here and that's all I'm going to use for him pretty simple right all right let's move on to mama first I'm gonna talk about like the non-traditional things that like I'm bringing first thing is a nursing pillow this one is from snuggly it's so pretty so much more comfortable than the poppy so I'm ringing this because it is super helpful especially those first couple of days cuz they're so small that it's kind of hard to hold them up on your boobs so bringing that I'm also bringing in my pregnancy pillow I brought my pregnancy pillow the first time to the hospital with me and it was the best decision I ever made if you get anything out of this video that is for you to pack your pregnancy pillow the reason for that is because hospital beds are so big and the edging of it like is not secure feeling so when you're super big and super pregnant and like just so tired and just want to sleep and get cozy this is so nice because it's so much pillow edge that you can just snuggle up on it you don't have to keep asking for my pillows it's cozy it's comfortable it's breathable you have support I literally gave birth with minor but with this pillow around me because it just helped me feel so supported whether you have an epidural or not I think it's very convenient just to have that just to sleep a little bit more comfortable so this is my bag right here it is the fun design a week in your bag Jordan and I both have one so I'm gonna bring one Jordan's gonna bring one and that's it the first time around we had so many bags like I had the banker bag I had this bag I brought a carry-on bag Jordan brought his own bag he had a backpack like we had way too many things and then in addition to bringing the pregnancy pillow the nursing pillow it was just like a lot to keep in charge of in our room felt very cluttered so this time I said nope we each get one bag fill that bag up but like I'm not gonna bring a purse I'm not gonna bring like little things cuz you're just gonna lose track of it and your rooms gonna get really messy and if you're clean freak like me like that kept driving me crazy and I kept cleaning my room when I was supposed to be sleeping and so let's open up my bag so I can show you guys what I have in here I think I'm gonna start off with postpartum items that make sense yeah I guess I guess we could start with that so first thing I'm bringing for myself is this penny button from Frieda as you guys know the hospital will give you those normal squeezy bottles and those are great but once I saw this I said I need to try this because the thing about the normal water bottles when you go to like spray you kind of have to like angle yourself and like it's kind of hard to get the water down there but this guy you're able to just put them right under and squeeze the water directly up so it makes it a lot more convenient health I think this will be a lot better I'll keep you guys updated but this is something that I did get for myself postpartum I got this new nursing bra that looks very comfortable and just like unclips I actually accidentally bought this at Target the other day I went to buy a normal bra I bought this and then I got home and I was like oh wait it's a nursing bra but it's like the gooiest material ever as you can see on Amazon I also ordered a three pack of like those regular nursing bras that you just pulled down that are very like cottony material so those I will add to my bag as well but that's still coming in this time what I'm doing different for myself as I am bringing it a what is this called this isn't shapewear this is like but it's not a belly band either it's like I don't even know once you give birth your core is very very weak and you kind of just feel like I don't know you have like a lot of weight right here because things are still going into place your organs are still going into place but you have like no core and no support and I remember that was very uncomfortable to me I felt very strange and felt very weak and I so desperately wish that I would have brought something to the hospital to give me that support so I thought this would be the best thing to wear I had a lot of swelling after giving birth to Alethea so my legs were : so this thing has the like part but part and then this goes up your waist it's a very very stretchy material so it seems very comfortable I'll let you guys know how I end up liking it but I am bringing this just to give me extra support it's not for anesthetics it's not to like make myself look skinny or anything like that it's just for the support because if you've given birth before you know how like weak you just feel in the course so this is something I'm ringing for myself that's different I'm also going to be bringing a taka taka taka however you pronounce it I didn't have one of these when I had Alethea and I wish that I did I had a milk saver instead but that thing was just super messy this is just so much easier for undies I ordered these off of Amazon they are like high-waisted underwear I remember just feeling like the underwear that I had was too small and not supportive enough like again it kind of goes back to this thing like I just didn't feel like well supported at all so I got this this will kind of like not high but tummy but like I'll have somewhere to put my tummy and this is big enough where it'll hold all my pads and everything else and I'm happy with this it was like a pack of four so I'll link those down below something a lot of you suggested to me was to bring compression socks and I didn't the first time and I wish that I had because like I said I got very very swollen after giving birth like I couldn't even stand because my feet were like so swollen my toes wouldn't touch the ground like my entire life was really swollen my knees were really swollen so I am wringing compression socks this time around I'm not sure if the doctor would recommend it necessarily I'm gonna ask them but I'm gonna bring them just in case and then as far as clothes go I'm reading things that are very comfortable so on Amazon I did order myself labor and delivery gown which just opens up in the front and opens up in the back it's just black very basic but I also did order a dress that is a nursing dress that just like buttons down right here so honestly I plan on wearing that a majority of the time that I'm inside the hospital or just like a sports bride underwear because it's probably gonna be hot and you get sweaty after giving birth like I'm sweating right now thinking about it but I just want cozy comfy things the first time around for some reason I brought like tight shirts tight pants type things I don't know what I was thinking but I'm not doing this time so I have a couple of t-shirt dresses I have biker shorts and oversized t-shirts and I have sweatpants and that's basically it so they're all like cute things so I'm gonna feel cute and stylish in them but they're like loose-fitting not too tight easy access for the boobs easy access to take off your pants if you need to just like very comfy cozy things like I mentioned at the beginning one of the things that I regret doing was not packing everything ahead of time so I'm literally packing my Yeti and my straw already and putting it in here so I don't have to think about it and also bringing this which has like a plug for other things now I have been told that you might not be allowed to bring this I'm bringing it just in case if I can if not I also ordered on Amazon to six-foot chargers for both Jordan and I which I will put in this bag directly so we don't have to think about bringing their own chargers and our own things I'm making sure to like buy duplicates of things to just have in here and not think about so I'm doing that I'm also going to be bringing in my iPad in my laptop for entertainment purposes I was very bored when I was in labor with Olivia I was in labor for 30 hours I was so tired of being in that hospital and I was just so bored and I wish I would have brought my laptop so I'm reading my laptop bringing my iPad bringing things to keep me entertained besides my phone those are like the only like weird things and now I will show you guys like my toiletry stuff so I remember feeling very gross like I feel like that's just like obviously like you feel very empowered after giving birth but then again you feel kind of like Ben because there's like so much blood coming out of you you're sweating profusely your hair you have breast milk everywhere there's poop yellow poop everywhere like you don't feel your best so I wish that I would have had face masks when I was in the hospital so this time around I am ringing different face masks for me to do before giving birth after giving birth just like just to do because as you know the hospital is very dry so I'm ringing this one by pixi this is actually my husband's I pulled this out of his drawer don't ask me why he had this he loves to do face masks too so I'm being this one which is a sheet mask and then I'm also bringing a normal face mask I use this one by fresh it's called their rescue mask my friend Esther actually gifted to this me after I gave birth to Olivia as a postpartum gift and I still have it and I love it dearly so I'm gonna bring this and this for myself I'm also bringing a pillow spray and a misting spray just to spray around the room because it like does not that it smells but like you want to feel fresh and after showering yes you feel fresh but then like to get back in the same bed in the same sheets like if that's not as fresh so I'm reading this just to kind of give the room a nice little spray of love I am also bringing some lotion and body oils so this is another thing you're so dry when you're in labor and delivery because the hospitals are just dry man I don't know why but they are dry so I mean this guy which I have total lotion and then this one where I have my oils so this is oil is gonna be nice just to like a lather myself up after giving birth but also in labor when I'm laboring if my back is really hurting Jordan can like give me a massage using some oil or something I don't know now the rest of the toiletries I have are just basic stuff don't forget soap like a soap bar I don't like the soap bars they have so I made sure to pack one of these toothbrush hair oil deodorant q-tips I'm also bringing more hair ties extra hair ties that I really like I'm leaving 3 hair ties just to be safe I'm also bringing a whole thing of lip balm again things get dry and crusty in there and then I'm also bringing some epsom salts so I did this the first time around but I didn't get a chance to labor in the bathtub which was upsetting but if I do get the chance to this time I would love to so I am bringing some bath salts again just to make things smell good I'm not sure if you can use them in the bathtubs I have to ask but I'm going to bring it just to be safe and then the other thing I'm bringing for myself postpartum is dermatitis and tucks they did give these to me in the hospital this is actually the same bottle that I used when I gave birth to ilithyia because I had extra these are my postpartum things so my hospital did give them to me but again I want to have more stuff and be over perfectly aired now you're probably wondering oh no Melina why are you bringing any pads well I don't know maybe I should bring some maybe I should I wasn't going to because they had plenty of pads they had the really long ones but they had normal ones too so I don't know if I'm gonna bring any maybe I should just in case like on our way home or some things just so I have them when I get home I guess I'll do that so I guess I will place an order I was gonna do a target pickup today actually of a couple more things that I thought I would need and I think that will be one of them but that is all that I am bringing so currently have a little notebook here with me of things that I cannot hide duplicates of so for example I need to bring my laptop but I'm not gonna buy a duplicate of my laptop that I keep it home and keep in my hospital bag that's ridiculous nobody has that type of money what I'm gonna do is write that stuff down same with my camera I need to bring my camera but I use my camera every day to work and do normal things so that's something I need to write down makeup my makeup bag what I'm doing is I have this right here I'm gonna do my makeup tomorrow and what I'm gonna do is as I'm doing my makeup I'm gonna take any product or anything that I and throw it in here as soon as I'm done doing my makeup I would have had every product that I've used for my normal makeup routine in this bag and then what I'll start doing is doing my makeup out of this bag and every day when I use it I'll just put it back in here but then that way I know everything I'm bringing is what I actually used in my routine so I did wear makeup when I had al a Fiat I didn't have makeup on when I labored right before I started pushing I put some makeup on it took me five minutes and I felt great and wonderful after giving breaths so I don't recommend laboring with makeup on because you have no idea how long you're gonna be laboring for but you can definitely push with makeup on so that's just a little hack for you guys of how to make sure you don't forget anything so that's what I'm gonna do tonight and honestly I feel like that's everything l need again I'm doing this one in 38 weeks pregnant so hopefully I'm prepared feel free to let me know if I'm forgetting something or like what you brought in wish you would have brought let's keep that conversation open down there and if I think of anything else I'll make sure to comment and I'll let you guys know what I end up putting on this list in my description box so in the description box I like list out everything then using as well as like links to anything and I'll keep you guys updated on how I end up liking this or how I end up liking the new nursing bras and all that good stuff bye I hope you guys enjoyed today's video I hope it's helpful if any of you are giving birth Congrats and just push and pray those are my tips for you guys I love you so much and I will see you in my next video bye if you guys welcome to my channel and welcome back today we are doing a nighttime routine when I'm filming this I'm 38 weeks pregnant and I am three centimeters dilated and I am 75 percent effaced and that was of a couple of days ago so I may have progressed a little bit by then but looking and feeling very pregnant baby boy has definitely dropped and my back is killing me as you can tell I'm like very out of breath and ma'am over here definitely knows he's coming because she is attached to my hip to did just transition Alethea out of her second nap which she normally would take around five o'clock ish until 6:00 which was perfect because I was able to get like my workout in really quickly and then get started on dinner before she woke up but now she is awake during that time so you can probably hear her pit her padding in the back she's really good at entertaining herself though she currently has a marshmallow in her hand and she's playing with her mini she was dragging my rug that I have in the kitchen over there but today's video is basically just gonna be our nighttime routine having a baby that is 15 months and being basically nine months pregnant so if you guys like this video make sure to subscribe give it a big thumbs up and I will continue making videos like this I'd say our nighttime routine basically starts around like 5 o'clock ish that is normally when I finish up work so normally either I'll be done filming a video or I'll be done posting a video and having it go live so I just posted a video today so that is up and done and for me now it is night time mode so basically I will always make dinner I feel like we cook pretty frequently especially since Kobe 19 so either I will cook dinner or my husband will cook dinner kind of like take turns and if I'm not that I'm doing something else for the house whether it's like laundry or spending time with lazy a' or doing something i don't there's always something to do so I was gonna make it somewhat fish do you like it then that's pretty I just got a package in from Amazon of a couple of things that I got to her yeah cuz they hi you see height what do you have the for dinner tonight I was gonna make some rice and some fish and a couple of like things along with the fish and then maybe like a salad normally I try to make dinner as fast as possible so it can take anywhere between like 1530 minutes but I really do enjoy cooking and it's kind of like how I unlined and relax so I can't drink wine right now I normally love to drink wine well so normally I will just get a wine glass and put like juice inside of it and like pretend like I'm sipping on wine I always love to have some wine when I'm not pregnant obviously but we can pretend so unlearn we do that for myself this get some nice music going calming music I love classic music I love like Amy Winehouse style music like very old-school like 70s 80s type music so I'll get that going and start our dinner all right before I start dinner always make sure to empty the sink out and like do like a quick little clean and refresh of everything so I don't feel messy when I'm cleaning and then for her over here I have just like a couple of things for her so I have some cards in here I have a couple of books so I'm just gonna put these down for her to play with normally she won't even play with these she'll just play with stuff around the house but still she has her stickers over here and magnets so she'll keep herself busy but I try my best to kind of help her and if she does start to get super needy I will go and put her on the learning Tower and have her help me cook or I'll give her a snack or something while I try to finish up dinner but as you can do over what huh yes where's Minnie hi you want to put them in the mama room here let's turn it on and put him in there she like pretends like they're her babies all right so she's good I'm gonna sneak away and start on the rice       too fast me so Alexia basically does get a fast every night she really likes playing like feel like it's her online and it's part of like her little night routine so I don't wash your hair every time but she does have curly hair so I actually don't brush her hair just like I don't brush my own hair so we don't ever brush your hair it doesn't really get tangled but one thing I do do is i'll watch it and then the next day I'll let go wash but the days I wash it I use this Shea Moisture deep treatment doing the good yet so it's this guy right here hi after I put her hair up a little bit of that and put it on the edge of my fingers and then I'll kind of just like massage your head and leave and I don't rinse it off or anything only helps with her curls and keeping her hair hydrated I feel like her hair super dry but this company is great there's no sulfates no parabens no fali no mineral oil no synthetic fragrance no animal testing like there's a huge list but they don't do so you have a baby that has curly hair that is my tip for you guys is just like really moisturize hair dude who's your mama Bubba daddy's doing the rest I am very tired in my back really good so she gets any Bubba every single night she has her because of your crib sound machine and goes to get ready to pray what's their prayers hands together okay okay that's pretty oh one thing we do is I try not to like dumb down or baby the prayers yes because that's how she's gonna learn how to say she understands and it for me if we like reduce God to like you know what I mean I'm not trying to be on like some high horse or anything about this thing she sees us praying and being serious about it then she'll carry that with her into her adolescence in yeah it won't like too so we try to pray like we would normally pray people ready to you let's pray okay now my turn to start my nighttime routine so my nights are so important to me I love my nighttime routine like I really really enjoy this time because it's the only like me time I get that I'm alone except if Jordan I shower together but we haven't been doing that as frequently as we want to used to do and keeping my armpits down because I need a shave and places aren't open to do Maxine so share with you okay so every night I always start off by taking off all my jewelry I don't shower with the mine and I don't sleep with any of my jewelry on and I am going to take off my makeup so I always take off my makeup with a light before I get into the shower and then I cleanse my face in the shower and then when I get out I do the rest of my skincare routine so today diamond Beauty is sponsoring today's video they sent me PR back in January and I'm very very picky about skin care because every one skin is very different and I've been trying it out since then and I have loved it and loved their products they're clean they're vegan sustainable and they're also cruelty free so I'm gonna show you guys the products that I've been using from them first product that I use by them is the gentle gel cleanser which is actually in the shower so I'm gonna grab that real quick so the cleanser just removes any dirt and oil and makeup and it's supposed to hydrate at the same time so after consistent use it's supposed to make your face feel nice and soft and very low moisturized so I'm gonna happen in the shower wash my face I'm not washing my hair I'm on day six actually but my hair does not feel greasy at all so I'm just gonna leave it as is and I will check back in with you guys once I'm done baby shower     Oh fresh and squeaky clean now I'm gonna finish with my routine specifically skincare routine I like to tone my face every other night toner is really good for your skin so this is the one that I use this is the super skin toner toner rejuvenate sand moisturizes and hydrates the skin so I just put it on a pad like this and kind of just like work it and that and it's also supposed to help with the pH balance of your skin next is my night cream I use this one the restorative night cream so I do like three to four pumps just like I had generous amount cuz I have very dry skin I love love love the way that makes my skin feel after it feels so moisturize and hydrated now their kits does include a day cream and sometimes I'll put the night cream and the day cream at night just so my skin feels like super supple and feels really good so I'm gonna put just a couple of squirts of that on and then last thing which is my favorite is the power glow this is a moisturizing serum and this has antioxidants to help defend against free radical damage in it increases moisture and just helps replenish and bring that skin - laughs dime beauty products are always on such high demand and they sell out very quickly I have a really good coat for you guys that will get you 20% off your entire order you

though so definitely check out as soon as you can to quickly snag those and use that code   hi hey pretty girl       all right here are my jammies I actually just got these in from Nasty Gal I ordered myself a couple of like cute loungewear things to wear postpartum just because I feel like I'm not gonna want to be wearing jeans or anything like that so I wanted some color things but I'm not gonna sit here and pretend like my nighttime routine is like super productive and I like read books and stuff because I don't I'm tired my back is killing me right now it has been in so much pain because like I mentioned earlier Alethea just wants me to hold her all the time and I'm not gonna not hold her like it's so bittersweet right now because I want to enjoy these last moments with her and just hold her as much as I can and give her all my attention while I can so back pain is what its gonna be so it's really hard if you've been pregnant before you know how it is but it's really hard to like correct your posture all the time so I just have like a lot of back pain like hip pain I guess so Jordan I did say we were going to start reading the Bible together every night but honestly that has yet to happen because the second I lay my head down to rest I fall asleep like I fall asleep instantly and that has been my favorite thing about this pregnancy is that once I go to bed and like once I fall asleep I stay asleep with Alethea I would get up like 10 times a night to go pee I don't do that with this pregnancy which has been amazing so this is currently what I have on my nightstand I have my water with some ice I have two popsicles that I'm gonna eat and then I have my phone charging and then this is the bed situation so I love to use my pregnancy pillow I have a pillow over here though and then I am gonna elevate my feet so I'm gonna put a couple of pillows right here and just elevate my feet this is my point of view of my toes but I don't have any swelling I haven't had any swelling at all actually I'm not sure why that is I haven't really done anything different I haven't gained nearly as much weight as I did with ilithyia so maybe that has to do with it but again I don't really know my favorite popsicle is so good and I actually so I'll have like anywhere between like two to four popsicles every night because I just love cold things but I bite my popsicles like I eat them anyone else do that my sister said it was weird that I do that where you lick it like that would take forever I just like biting it I normally just be on my phone answering the MS from you guys for at least like 30 minutes or so I do throughout the entire day but at the end of the day if you're like when I'm cooking dinner and like being back time with Olay theam looks like a fold like two hours ish that I'm not really able to get back to you guys so once I'm done with that and wrapped up with that that's normally when I will do that because oh but kind of like accumulate so I'm did that for a little bit I watched tic TOCs I did have quite a bit of a tic toc addiction so I have a timer set on my phone through the screen time thing that the iPhone provides and I only watch tic TOCs for 30 minutes so as soon as that timer is up I'm done and then lately I've been watching a lot of labor and delivery vlogs I've been watching a lot of like newborn vlogs postpartum vlogs just like things like that it's like what I've been watching on YouTube just to kind of get my mind and headset like ready for what my body is going to go through but I wanted to share with you guys this nurse that I found I've watched like all of her videos she is so informative and so helpful okay so her name is Sarah LaVon she's like a nurse in a doula but she has such good videos like explaining what your body is like going through so like she has a video about contractions and like what those actually are she has video on like what happens when your cervix thins out or like what you facing at me it's like it's been super helpful to watch our videos and just like really helped me understand what's going on with my body so it's not really what I will do Jordan I are not big smugglers well Jordans vixx hunkler I'm not not pregnant I can't I'm like it down touch me it's so hard for me to get comfortable and so hard for me to like maneuver that we don't fall asleep snuggling anymore we used to but hopefully once I'm not pregnant we can do that soon say come here Wow well how the turn cables is that right yeah that's what he says I'm not a big office fan but I know that line because I feel like it's all over okay 10 years ago when he actually said it and I thought it was hilarious me and Jake would always replay that and watch it and laugh and now it's on tick tock grade yeah like I thought it was funny before it was viral I normally am in bed by like 9:00 o'clock tops 9:30 if I'm feeling you know risky and on edge Jordan rolls into bed around like 3:00 a.m. well there's a difference between in bed and sleeping mm-hmm so milena and I will get in bed but we want always go right to sleep   now like I will be in bed I'll come into bed and everything like I'll fall asleep but Jordan will like still be downstairs doing his own shenanigans I don't know we don't have a TV in our room so if you want to watch TV yes do it downstairs I'm not usually watching TV what are you doing them cleaning reading doing stuff for work dilly dallying mm-hmm mostly dilly dallying what has been the thing that you've been doing every night for me giving massages I don't know how pregnancy massage yeah I don't know how I've convinced him but he's every night he's given me a at least a five to ten minute massage like on my back and hips and everything it's been wonderful I just imagine if that were me with all that weight in the front because you know I'm like really really lean and have like a shredded six neck so I just try to imagine what it'd be like to have a gut and out of pity and empathy I give Molina a massage well that continues after maybe though but it will that's all for my nighttime routine I feel like that's it's pretty simple pretty basic but hope you guys enjoyed and oh we need to do the baby mama dance challenge I know you don't want to do it but we have Alethea and she dances so well we'd have to do it I'll do with the leaf yeah yeah you this okay perfect yeah you we should film that tomorrow okay love you guys thank you for watching make sure to check out my description box down below for dime beauty stuff you guys want to choose some money and I will see you my next video bye f you're watching this that means I'm in labor I'm in labor uh-huh I wish I was in labor right now well like what I'm filming this because by the time you guys are watching this and would already be in labor but I'm not in labor as I'm currently filming it obviously oh I am feeling it so pregnant guys I am so over it with Alicia I did not ever really get to this point like I was just so excited and all of that but this time around I feel like I'm even more excited and I'm like dude just get out already um let me it's my tummy he's super duper low and I just like I don't know I'm very uncomfortable it's really hard for me to get comfortable I haven't had any swelling thank God we actually went to a restaurant for the first time yesterday and we sat at like a high table and my feet were like dangling and after dinner my feet were so swollen I could not fit my sandals back on but that was like the first time I had ever had any type of swelling I will show you my tummy so I'm currently 39 weeks and five days when I'm filming this so he has already dropped as you can tell but he is just getting bigger and bigger as the days go by um yeah very very very low if you're watching this that means I'm in labor I've no idea how things are gonna go down I've been thinking that I was gonna go into labor early maybe I did maybe I didn't I don't know we'll have to see in real life right now I'm actually about to go to my doctor's so she's gonna check me and see how far along I am or how dilated I am last time I went in I was through three centimeters and 75 percent effaced so hopefully I've progressed by then she also was gonna sweeten my membranes so maybe her sweeping my membrane will kick me into labor yesterday I was having contractions every 20 minutes and then at night they kind of just died off and stopped so I'm not like actively doing anything to induce labor adjourn I didn't do the dirty and I do think that that kind of get things going because after that that was two nights ago I was having contractions so I'm I don't know I don't know if I should just keep doing things that kind of are supposed to induce labor or not and just kind of let my body do its thing but then again like I don't know having sex and like walking and like different things that you like normally do in everyday life kind of do induce labor so I'm not gonna stop doing those but I can't wait to see his little face I'm so excited today I was doing laundry I've got a couple more PJs for him because I feel like he didn't have enough so I was I just got those in a couple days ago so I was just watching them and I was just like imagining tiny he's gonna be and what he's gonna look like in there and bringing him home and having Alethea meet him and having my parents meet him and Jordans parents like it's just such a fun time bringing a baby into the world so I was just getting all like jittery and like excited for that so my to-do list is slowly getting shorter today I like woke up so early I was doing laundry I was hanging up things in the lengthiest bedroom I was like finishing up his room I still have a couple of things I need to still do in his room so I've just been like really excited and I've actually had quite a bit of energy for the amount of discomfort I'm in just to like get things done and finished because the worst thing is bringing a baby into the world when you don't really feel prepared and as you guys know I've been saying I haven't been feeling prepared but now that his nursery is done and I feel like I've been able to kind of like close up on a lot of things that I was working on and things around the house like I've just been doing more like maintenance things so just like making sure our laundry isn't piling up and I need to paint my nails today like I want to paint my toenails so just like random little things that I feel like I need to do but what's different about this labor is I'm not able to go get a wax so I don't think I've ever even talked about this on any of my birth videos or like any of my like realtalk videos that I've done but I got a full Brazilian before having Alethea and it was like the best decision I ever made because afterwards I had a lot of stitching and I feel like just because I had a it was just so much easier to keep things clean it wasn't like an issue I didn't have like ingrown hair I didn't have to like worry about anything and it was the best so this time around salons and stuff are still closed so I'm not gonna be able to go do that so I wonder how differently that will be for like my recovery but that is something that I was a little bit sour about because I feel like having a wax definitely made a big difference and it was a really positive thing that I did but other than that I'm excited Jenna's excited Alesia has no idea what's coming her I actually bought her a really cute dress for her to wear when she meets him for the first time it actually came it I'm gonna go grab it cuz y'all want to see it don't you okay here's the dress that I got fairly phia for her to wear when she meets him for the first time I know this is such an extra thing to do but because we're not gonna have our photographer in our labor and delivery room which was really upsetting to me because we did with ilithyia and I love those pictures we are going to have a photo shoot when they meet each other so my best friend Esther is the one that takes all my photos and she was like I really wanted to take pictures of them meeting each other and I was like yes so that's like what we're gonna do as like our special photo and like special moments so I went ahead and got this just for lay Thea and then I got her a gift to give to him and then him a gift to give to her I'm gonna have oh I need to wrap those up I need to add that to my to-do list cuz I need to wrap those but that was something I thought that would be sweet for her like just as she gets excited and then something for her to give him but then she's gonna be excited because she's gonna get a gift from him as well so I'm trying to just make the transition as smooth as I possibly can but yeah she's gonna be wearing that dress but I'm so excited please keep me in your prayers I've been saying this whole time I don't really have a plan for my labor I am just going to pray and push and that's about it because last time you know everything just kind of went how I wanted to go and that's what's gonna happen anyway so thank you guys for keeping me and my prayer I will keep you guys updated on Instagram stories as much as I possibly can and hopefully next time we see you I have a little baby in my arms bye looks okay today don't worry Tookie will still love you as much as we do now our hearts will just grow Oprah dear God we are so thankful for this day that brought us to and been with us every step of the way thank you for blessing Melania and baby boy they're safe and healthy pregnancy thus far we know that you'll bring her and me going through until the end and just pray you'd be with them continue the bless little Tookie and let her know how much she's loved and our love will only continue to grow more and more for to keep every day and baby boy we love you and thank you for loving us first Jesus name Amen   hi honey I'm in labor hey so my brother broke around what 8:00 this morning yeah so I was contracting like basically every five to ten minutes the day before and I was like oh this is it like we're gonna have this baby and then at night they like completely slow down and we got to sleep all night I didn't have any contractions at night we were able to sleep get some rest and then I woke up in the morning and my water broke and then we had our mornings with Alethea just chilled with her for a little bit had a nice big McDonald's breakfast and then we came to the hospital and then we've just been straight up chillin my contractions aren't that bad right now I'm still only three centimeters dilated and he's chillin your hemoglobin your blood levels are normal which is a blessing yeah it's at an 11 which is like so so high for me normally it's at like an 8 or 9 7 sometimes so yeah I'm so excited and like I feel so relaxed I feel like because it's my second baby I kind of know what to expect so I'm not really nervous I'm just really excited because I know how exciting it's gonna meet and meet the baby and like you can never like imagine that feeling unless you go through it so I'm just very excited honestly a little bit bored I forgot my pregnancy pillow they forgot my nursing pillow I forgot blankets I forgot like things that like I actually really thought I would need but my water broke and I've been leaking like crazy and manic keeps feeling like I'm like fully peeing myself so it feels kind of weird like was Alethea this didn't happen it wasn't gosh is it was more like little trinkles but this time it's like all just coming out but my contractions have been pretty easy pretty slow their every five to ten minutes they haven't gotten that strong yet they probably will you'll be able to tell by my face once they start to get really bad but so far we're not there yet so we're just chilling guys they have double popsicles here so I get to eat too but it's like I'm eating one Melina's honestly just here for the popsicles   accessories it's a look so I got started on pitocin cuz things aren't really progressing I feel like we're just like so calm this ain't your first rodeo I know but it makes me really happy so yeah I mean contractions haven't been horrible so we're putting the epitopes in' trying to speed things up a little bit I was just like bouncing on the ball I'm trying to like stay upright and trying to like use get gravity and keep me open keep things flowing keep things open you like you granny panties at the heart yeah baby boy wants to do and when he wants to come we're hoping he's still gonna come tonight but we're just gonna play by ear I can't believe it 36 thanks six almost 6:30 so my wife my water is like still like coming out in like random gushes and it's so uncomfortable I feel like Alethea right now like this is what she feels like just like peeing yourself it's so weird it's so except that's amniotic fluid in that actual year and yeah but still it's like fluid coming out of you and you're just like sitting in it Oh God I literally just started crying like 30 minutes ago because I thought of her and I really miss her I'll see you tomorrow ticky yeah she hasn't checked me yet she's going to business       2:48 we came in here this massage Oh do it in the nose though I just feel like I'm openly not like I've literally feel     let's get those dresses and bear down Saul you got nice job honey                 hi guys guess what did great honey you only push for like 15 minutes and he looks just like a leaf yeah he has no way which means he looks just like me they have another baby did you amazing honey Jordan's first time holding him you're good baby just bad and I finally get together problem how's it been since I ate 20 hours and that gonna depress me oh my burrito oh my gosh I'm literally looking at Alethea he does look just like my gosh he's so tiny 6 pounds 8 ounces 19 inches long so you 6 pounds 8 ounces 19 inches so he's 2 ounces smaller than Alethea was in an inch or Timmy shorter mm-hmm but he looks a lot smaller than Olivia so we've been here all day the time is like 9:00 9:45 yes so he was born at 4:00 a.m. and he's been doing great he's literally just like been sleeping the whole time but I just took a nice warm bath I did a face mask I'm gonna own up if you can't tell I feel fine I like totally forgot about like the cramping that happens when you breastfeed and like the back pain because my back has been like a lot of pain my back feels bruised my chiming makes sense like this human just like came out of there but my bleeding is fine I only have the first-degree stitches so they're not too bad so it actually doesn't burn when I pee but things are just like swollen and all that so that we've been doing good he's eating like a champ like he'll literally just like feed for like 30 minutes not like sleeping he's really sweet and he's so quiet and I think we decided on a name yes we did okay so I like a name Jordan likes name I've been calling him my name Jordans been calling him his name and the name I like is one that wasn't actually even on our list I just thought of it earlier this morning but I was like looking up the meaning of it and it doesn't really have any like symbolic meaning so I was like really like that I want the name to be like meaningful obviously and the name that Jordan likes is Arielle and that means what lion of God lion of God or Ari for sure we'd call him re pretty much 99% of the time yeah so it's a very I think trendy name I'd say you think that's gonna be the name but we're still debating the middle name well that fun with the middle name I see his face welcome Ari well welcome to the world it's pretty crazy right now what's he doing look he did you ready to meet your   tomorrow she looks just like her yeah literally her twin the world is pretty crazy right now son but the Lord will lead us as we lead you and we'll always watch over and care for you the next day mr. slept so good he was like cluster feeding or series maybe because you get to go home and have him eat Alethea we get to go home we get to go home we're gonna meet your sister okay bye guys we'll see you next video oh don't be sad hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video I didn't really get a chance to do it and show to it because we were just so excited to have it Alethea me re of course so I thought I would enjoy it it has been almost two weeks now since he has been born and we are just so happy and so excited Jordan is downstairs with him right now he's about to come up I wanted to enter this video and first off thank you guys for half a million subscribers thank you wait my celebrate ready to celebrate oh thank you guys so much for half a million subscribers I was actually in labor when it happened so I feel like I was kind of out of it and wasn't really able to comprehend it or like absorb what was going on but I want to just thank you guys so much for following along and for being a part of this so for Crona happened I wanted to do a giveaway where I can hang out with you guys for a day like I would do like a random giveaway and I would fly you guys out or I would go to you and we would just like spend the week together but obviously since Corona happened that's not gonna be a thing wouldn't give him a hug she's been very very sweet with him but if you guys have any ideas what I could do for that giveaway instead let me know because I'm open to ideas but because of Corona I want to be cautious and safe and respectful of everyone so let me know that is one proud dad right there a little bit I was gonna say all of our kids that look just like Jordan and it's not fair I have a feeling he's gonna end up working like me because he has blue eyes and he has really light hair compared to ilithyia Alethea is like our tan dark baby brown eyes brown hair sham skin he's fair with lighter hair and blue eyes damn it hold we're gonna give him a hug yeah baby bear hug who farted Frank your belly button it's under his shirt he's wearing give him a kiss so the clips you guys are about to see when this first came home because of Khurana we weren't able to have a photographer in the room when I gave birth and we did freely yeah and if anywhere but right now ten out of ten to recommend that because I love those pictures so much but Esther who was the one that took my photos she was like can I take pictures of them when they come home and I thought that was a genius idea is a really great way to capture that moment and just have that so you will see a person in the room taking pictures but that's the shoes taking those pictures so I hope you guys enjoyed the video of Alania and re meeting for the first time I will get back into vlogging regularly she really wants the whole hey put your arms up arms up like this so like I was saying I am gonna get back into blogging I was planning on posting once to twice a week depends on how the week so there are some days that are really really good days and then other days where I'm like how am I gonna do this forever so I'm just taking it easy transitioning back into it so I appreciate what's his patience and everything but let's go ahead and get into the video where Alethea meet sorry is it the first time we just pulled up to the house oh ok joy when you come in you close the door behind you yeah in his room okay okay you can come in       whoa wait - do you guys like to do stuff at the scandal it's baby brother little brother horses belly but where's his feet five years this is here to get tons of love oh good morning hi baby this is a lot harder to do with one hand     so   hey guys good morning welcome to today's vlog i'm just going to do a little day in the life basically just showing you guys what life has been looking like since having baby boy so he is three weeks and a couple of days old now he's still such a tiny little peanut and oh we are so happy and toki's bringing me cookies from the pantry i cannot leave the pantry door open because she always brings me cookie you wanna you can have one cookie okay can you say please if you think please you show me how you say please   you want to tell everyone how much you love baby boy she calls him ba and then the other day she started saying her mom which is uh portuguese for brother right that's what she was saying her mom she hasn't been saying it anymore she keeps saying bye again but i think it's cute when she calls them irmo but she's been speaking so much portuguese recently and guys i it's such an answered prayer because she's adjusting very well and i think a big reason why that is is because we've been sticking to her schedule only times i've noticed that she gets really upset is if first thing in the morning when she wakes up if i go in her room to get her with him she gets really upset she started crying like i've done it a couple of times um just because i didn't want to set him down and i've noticed that she's whiny she gets upset she wants me to hold her so what i've been doing instead is i just give him to jordan or just put him in his bassinet or something and then i get her and then i ask her if she wants to say hi to him and see him for the day and she gets excited so that's the only time i've noticed um she hasn't been like aggressive towards him i think she's just too young to have jealousy and still a little too young to like have resentment towards him so we try to include her with everything she loves to hold him so she'll always ask hold to the hold if you guys watch my video where they meet each other in the intro of that video she did it like many times but she just wanted to hold him you have one cookie already yeah mama said one cookie one cookie so yeah we're just super happy and super excited i know that it probably will get a lot more difficult he is just still a newborn and he does sleep a lot um one thing though is he has size acid reflux so i had suspected that he had reflex from the beginning because he was just like such a fussy eater he would projectile vomit he projectile vomited so many times and it would get it would come out of his nose it would like literally get all over his face and it was terrifying so i was having a really hard time sleeping in the beginning because any little noise i heard him make i would instantly get up because i was afraid something was happening to him and i talked about it on instagram yesterday and a lot of you recommended the outlet out outlet thing that like goes on their foot i'm gonna look into it i'm gonna ask my doctor um and see what she suggests first before i spend all that money because that thing is expensive that's just been one thing we've been struggling with but other than that he's been really good we're not really sleeping i'm not gonna pretend because i'm not and coffee is getting me through the day and i know that coffee sometimes could cause the reflux so i'm not gonna rule that out as a thing until my doctor tells me i need to stop drinking coffee because there's literally no way i'd be able to function throughout the day and take care of this little this little munchkin oh yes yeah day without coffee wanna show everyone where's doogie's nose where are sookie's eyes where's tsuki's ears where's zuki's head where are your hands yeah you're so smart your toes too yeah her favorite thing to do is point out all of ari's facial features facial features as well as all of her dolls she'll just sit there all day and like point at all of that we've been trying to keep alecia busy during the day because she's only taking one nap now so even though her nap is three hours long once she wakes up there's still like a big chunk of time so i'm so happy because her swim classes have started back up again so we're actually getting ready to go to that my mom is here so that one of us can swim can watch legway okay and we're still working on a nickname for him olathe's nickname is tooky and my sister came up with it i was still in the hospital and she texted me she goes i'm coming to see tuki and i was like what kooky she just like randomly thought of that nickname and we have yet to think of one for him i've said a couple of random things but i can't even remember what they are my memory is so bad right now do you wanna go swimming can i yeah and go swimming classes um no no you wanna go swimming put on your bathing suit yeah i'm talking out loud here because i've been a little conflicted on like what types of videos to do um because when i had alathia obviously like as a newborn and like when you first bring a baby into the world there's like so many new things and i wanted to capture it and show it all to you guys but i also didn't want to bombard everyone with like baby videos but this time around i'm sorry but i am bombarding all baby videos because i did it with alethia and i so wish that i did so the next couple of videos will probably just be like a day in the life with a newborn like a nighttime routine with a newborn like actually our night like sleeping not like night time routine like not today routine um i was also thinking of doing a nursery tour so just the next couple of weeks will be more like baby heavy videos just because i didn't really have a chance to do his nursery tour because it wasn't really done and now it's done um but just expect slightly more baby videos than normal and then i'll go back to like my normal stuff but just because it's all just so fresh and so new i want to make sure to capture all of it so i'm done babbling i babbled too much but i wanted to update you guys and if you follow don't follow me on instagram you probably aren't up to date on all this um but yeah i've basically been living in oversized t-shirts and biker shorts because it's the easiest thing to wear it's like the most comfortable and i'm just like always hot and sweaty so it's very easy to just take off my shirt and be able to breastfeed and then put it back on and i'm all good and dandy it hides the mom pooch as well so definitely love the biker shorts are you guys kidding are you this he literally looks just like alithea they are twins but he has blue eyes so as you can tell his hair is a little bit lighter it's a lot more fair and his eyes are like a deep dark blue and the lathes are brown where are your teeth show me your teeth how old are you you're one yes you are by's not even one oh give him a busy reikoson all right miss tukey is ready i found both this like little cover-up thing that she's wearing at plato's closet or not plato's closet what's it called once upon a child so it's a thrift it's like thrifted basically and i found this there as well no no yeah we're not there so that's that tookies set and ready and then i'm bringing the fun design bag i think this is the color rose it was part of their spring collection but this is the big one so in here i have stuff both for her and him i have two diapers for her two diapers for him an outfit she needs for him wipes burp cloths and then i'm bringing another outfit for her to wear after and then a towel for her as well so that should be more than enough um   i just fed him about 30 minutes ago and because of his reflux like i have to really plan it out because he has to stay upright for at least 30 minutes so um he's up right right now he's just chilling but what i've been doing that has really changed my breastfeeding journey so far not that i didn't have a successful breastfeeding journey with olathe but i didn't go as long as i wanted to and i really struggled with my supply towards the end and that is this haka hakka haka and this is great so i just fed him so this is what was coming out of this side because i was feeding him on this side and this is what was leaking from this side and i was able to catch all of that so if any of you are breastfeeding and haven't used this yet i highly suggest you try it because i have been able to build a bomb freezer supply just from what this catches and it's called it's called the hakka pump but it's not really a pump because it's not actively pumping you just suction it on and it collects what falls um but it's been fabulous we went grocery shopping yesterday and i cleaned the fridge for the first time in a long time and let me tell you my life feels together when my fridge is clean because meal time is so hard for me i don't know if it's like that for you guys too but alethia is always so hungry and i struggle to find food for her when the food when the fridge is unorganized so i organized it yesterday so i'm just casually showing that off so clean your fridge but the reason i was opening up the fridge was to show you guys this so i collect milk all day basically but it's not enough to like put in a box like a full one of these so i keep one in the fridge and as the day goes by i toss it in here and that is totally okay to do i follow multiple lactation consultants that have said that that is okay to do like if it's kept at the same temperature and then at the end of the day once it gets full like this one is full i toss it in the freezer and it stays there for ever so with the milk i'm freezing i'm not sure what i'm gonna do with it yet um i'm keeping it because i don't know what might happen to my supply i'm praying that it will continue and keep up but i'm keeping it just in case something happens um if i i don't know i'm just keeping it for now and if i start to notice that things are going well i will donate it so   all right and just like that it is the end of the day i swear the days just fly by um we are about to have some dinner we're actually gonna go sit on our patio that is almost done i'll show you guys that in the next video or vlog that i end up doing but i know you guys didn't see much of jordan today he was actually cleaning out our cars because our cars have gotten so messy um and they were just gross snacks and goldfish and crumbs everywhere so i'm gonna end today's vlog i hope you guys enjoyed stay tuned for many more two would you like to say you say bye aries he's awake oh my oh man you say bye bye bye bye ey guys today's video I am going to be doing a nursery nurse nursery tour of my baby boy and I'm so excited because I put my heart and soul into this nursery and I will say it was very difficult to decorate a nursery during a pandemic because I had to order a lot of stuff online and I didn't know how it was gonna look when it all came together in person or like it was just a little bit difficult but I was able to do it and I'm very happy and this is probably one of my favorite rooms in the entire house because it's so quiet and quaint and comfy it's just like the second you walk into this room you feel very comforted like you just it's just the I don't know are you picking up what I'm dropping because that's kind of what you want a nursery to be like you don't want to go in there and like feel chaotic and crazy you definitely want it to be a peaceful place for you and your baby so this is going to be his nursery tour some of these things have been thrifted so I will try my best to link as many things as possible but there are a couple of things that I did thrift and a couple of things that I had from Alesia I'll explain it all through the throughout the entire video but I really hope you guys enjoy this room tour of RVs he's currently downstairs taking a little nap but yeah if you guys are new here don't forget to subscribe down below and give this video a thumbs up I actually just redid Alethea's room as well so let me know if you guys wanted updated room of hers and I can definitely do that but I'm very excited to show you guys his room okay so here is a first glimpse at his room when you walk in so basically the first thing that you see is his that daybed and you might be wondering like okay we know why do you have a daybed in a baby's room and my explanation for that is that was a late yeah she did not like her rocking chair and it took up a lot of space and I just wasn't a big fan of it we really use it and with breastfeeding I much rather breastfeed laying down so having a nice daybed allows for me to do that and it's comfortable and I plan on using this as Alethea's toddler bed when she's a little bit older so I'm saving some money I'm getting a lot of usage out of it and I think it looks beautiful and so it's a big statement piece right when you walk in but it really worked and flows with this room so one thing you'll notice is that my accent color for his room is this really pretty green color so this gesture is actually from Ikea it's a little bit small but I got it in a raw wood so I was able to paint it so I will link the exact color that I used down below I can not remember it but I really really love this green and then this also matches these floating shelves that we have while they're not floating there like hanging on these things but those are the two same colors I tried to use different green accents with the paintings up there so everything kind of gets tied in together again very neutral but little pops of green to make it more boyish here's a better look of like what this corner looks like his room is a little bit strange so his door is at an angle so I wasn't able to put a full-size dresser here but then on this wall behind me I was and also be able to put a full-size one so I went with a shorter one this is where we keep all his essential things so right on top is where we change him this is from Etsy it's just a really pretty woven basket I love the look of it and of course a mirror I think it's so cute to have a mirror on top of the changing table because as I get older they can look at themselves in the mirror you can play with them you can take really cute pictures here as well and then it's only three pieces so I keep just these central things here so I have diapers and wipes honestly guys I have not really organized his things because he's growing so much right now so stuff is kind of in shambles but these are just like the things that he wears every day and the night PJ's down here and like burp cloths and stuff so his stuff isn't really all that organized but then I got his poles from Amazon so I'll link those down below we still have to patch up the hole because this was a little bit bigger than what came in but I really really like this set up he thing is very homey and cozy and then as we turn it this way I have this little light that I got from Ikea I wanted some type of secondary light besides the one up at the top just for a night time when I'm changing his diapers and stuff and then over here we have this accent wall so this is something that my husband and I did together I've logged all about it so I'll link it up here for you guys if you want to see how we did it but it was honestly very simple and we saved so much money in that original video though I did make it a deeper orange color that was kind of like a terracotta color but honestly it was clashing too much with the green so I actually did change it like a couple of weeks before I gave birth to a more muted tone which I will link down below but I'm very happy that I did that because although it is a statement piece it doesn't take away from the rest of the room which was my goal I wanted it to complement the room not take away from the rest of the room so that's what we have here and then right over the bed we have a floating it shelf so these are actually two shelves together you can probably see where they kind of meet it was like impossible to get it to be straight because our walls aren't straight like no wall is honestly ever straight so we just put those two together and then I just wanted cute little pieces of art and I gotten these off of Etsy so I'll link them down below and then to kind of break it up I added a cute little hat that his grandma gifted him I had this plant and then another plant over here so I just like love the way that leaning art looks up like that and then I just kept everything minimal here honestly I didn't buy anything new from here this is all stuff I previously had so I was very thankful that I was able to like reuse some things but I have a little truck like I said I tried to incorporate some green tones and green olive colors that would just flow really well with the rest of the room and then you probably noticed these two frames are empty the reason for that is because I wanted to put pictures of him and his sister when they first met and then over here I wanted to put a picture of my tummy when I was pregnant with him but this little picture right here is my favorite it's a fat little whale that is so stinking cute and I just think it's like a perfect nursery color for his room and then if you keep going over we have this little corner which I wasn't sure what to put at first but then I saw there's that target and I loved the length of it it's pretty tall and full and I thought it was perfect it is fake but it does look really real and then this was something I kind of struggled with because I need it a nightstand like if you have a room with a baby you need somewhere to put stuff and there's nowhere else so I found this at IKEA I love the size of it it's huge but it's also very practical where I can put my breast milk stuff on it I can put his bottles I can put wipes like anything that you need you can just throw on there so I just put a couple of cute little things on there when he starts sleeping in his room I will put his sound machine there as well but I just put a couple of blocks and just a couple of other random things that I found but this is what like the view looks like from the room over there clearly the bed is a main focal point but it's just so beautiful that it deserves all the glory it gets and then moving on to this corner of the room we have his crib obviously but real quick I wanted to talk about the curtains so they are a warmer tone these were in ilithyia's room but I just love it so much more in here I just think it adds a little bit of something in curtains makes such a difference in a room I wasn't gonna add any at first because we have roman shades but I'm so glad I did because it just made such a big difference in this room okay so this part right here is honestly my favorite part of his room I was struggling so badly to figure out what to put on this wall and then I came across the picture on Pinterest where they did something similar like this so I didn't want to do floating shelves because I have floating shelves literally everywhere else in my room in my house so I kind of wanted to do something different and this is these are three separate pieces of wood my husband and I actually made this ourselves and then we have kinda have like a thin yarn that's connecting everything together and I just love the way that it looked and the way that we styled it I just put really cute little antiques that I found and little things that I had around the house so here's a one little thing that this was just like a little toy I had these box from Alethea this book as well and then three little plants this is something I really wanted to do because this is what they did on their picture and I thought it looked adorable and then here the tops of this little airplane is rifted these are a little pair of shoes I got him that footprint is actually a lakeya's which I will have to replace with his foot but I did all of this before he was born and then just like a cute little basket so I really love the way that this looks and just flows very well together and then of course last thing is the crib so this is the ikea crib I love how affordable it is but I love how simple it is as well and again I was struggling on what to do on the wall I was looking for a piece like this with a lion's head on it I wasn't able to find it but I found this on Amazon like I said I had very limited resources as to what I can get but I really loved the way that it turned out and then we actually do have the Newton baby mattress but I did just put a really cute little sheet on it because I just thought it would look so cute this is from Sally baby I'm not sure if you can see it but it has really cute little dots and textures on it and then of course a little cuddle in kind this was the first gift that they actually gave us for him and I think it's so cute I love the little crown it ties everything it really well together then for his baby monitor we have this one that's from eco and believe that's how you pronounce it we actually did not have a monitor with Alethea but he has acid reflux silent acid reflux which is terrifying so I love this because I'm able to track literally everything about him and his heart rate and temperature and all of this stuff so it brings me some peace of mind alright last thing I'm going to mention because I can hear him at downstairs crying with my sister I think he's probably hungry but it's this rug so I love the rug so much it really ties in all the colors and makes it look not so white and beige and creams and stuff and it has a little accent of rain that ties that in so I just love this rug the only issue I'm having is keeping it flat and laid out because it's on top of carpet but I will link it down below a lot of you suggested different ways for me to get it - like flatten out and stay straight I have yet to try those out so I will try those out and let you guys know I think what I'm gonna do is try Valkyrie all the edges flat and see how that works but hope you guys enjoyed this again I will link everything down below I hope you guys enjoyed this and gives you some inspiration tacking in any of your photos and things if you do I would love to see it but I love you guys and I'll see you my next video bye heyyo oh my good hi this is Ari well hi guys today's video is going to be my birth the story of giving birth to baby Ari it's been quite a rough morning okay so he has silent acid reflux sometimes it's like fine and normal and he's great other times he like is just crying non-stop and you can tell he's in so much pain and it makes me so sad and there's nothing we can do and I really wish I could take the pain away but he's just now calm down so hopefully he'll fall asleep while I'm filming this video but he just loves to me in his moments arms he loves to nurse he that it's just first couple dates are just such but today's video I am going to be sharing it my birth story and how that all went down so I did do a vlog on it but throughout the vlog you kind of just seen what's happening you don't really get to the inside scoop them behind the scenes of like other things I feel like it's just more of like what was going on and so I'm gonna kind of explain everything and walk everything through yes I did get this boy out in four pushes which I'm very happy about because I pushed for two hours with Alethea and I do not want to do that again so you have already seen the birth lot I will link it up here if you also haven't seen my bird flog on we delivering my daughter Lika definitely check that one out first because my worth of Hera was very traumatic I was in labor for 30 hours I almost died like it was really bad so with that in mind you'll see how much happier I am about this one how much smoother things ran and how I just really didn't have a plant with this one I was just kind of going with whatever happened because I had already been through the worst so if you guys liked this video make sure to give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe down below I am doing the one bit more heavy baby stuff right now just because he is still a newborn I we have a couple more videos planned honestly of like newborn things I was gonna do like a nighttime routine with us so kind of show you guys like what our nights actually looks like from like 12 until like 6:00 a.m. that type of thing I wanted to do like our morning routine like those types of videos but if you guys have any recommendations like always leave them down below as well as any prayer requests I keep forgetting to mention that but if you haven't ever prayer requests please leave it down below but let's get into we grab a coffee you get a snack get something because I'm gonna get chatty and sewing guides in all the details of everything okay I'm high we'll take this off it's like a rainy day today so it's like very sticky and gloomy out it's very okay so I'm gonna start from around when I was 36 weeks and like go from there because I had already dilated to one and a half almost two centimeters when I was 36 weeks pregnant so I thought I was gonna have him early and I did actually now from early so I hung around once I needed I laid for a couple of weeks and then after that I was dilated to a three so I was three centimeters dilated and walking around like normal for probably two weeks almost three weeks so in my mind I was like okay the suit is definitely coming early I kind of felt like my body was really getting ready to go into labor so in my mind I was like I'm not going to 40 weeks I'm definitely having him before then and I couldn't even picture being pregnant for that much longer because I was just getting so high and I'm comfortable and like taking care of a toddler at the same time it was just like all ice so I was happy that I was progressing and I had my 38 week appointment I was going to be 39 weeks a couple of days and my doctor decided to swap my membrane I had asked her to do it because I just knew that that would kind of kickstart labor and it did so she sweat my membrane on a Wednesday and I had him on a Saturday so on that Wednesday she slept my membrane I went about my day I went home ELISA had a playdate with her best friend we just chilled out and then the next day on Thursday I went into early labor and I was having contractions probably every five to twenty minutes and I was like kind of documenting all of us on Instagram stories for you guys because I really just wanted you to like see behind the scenes of what that was like so I actually still have my log because I didn't download an app I feel like the apps are a little bit confusing so all I did was just like right in my notes like every time I'd have a contraction I wasn't noting how long they were because they all they were all pretty much 30 seconds to a minute long anyway so I was just trekking basically helpful frequently I was having him so basically having them all day and I was so excited I was so ready I wasn't in any pain I tried to stay active I tried to let me get my body to keep opening up and keep pushing him now to keep doing its thing so that day I was like decorating with my daughter's room I was painting her room I painted really cute little rainbow in her room like I was just trying to keep myself busy and basically finish everything I had on my to-do list because although I had a feeling he was coming early like that doesn't really mean anything like he could have just come like two weeks later it's so difficult because they could literally come between like 37 weeks to 42 weeks like that's like a month of when they could come so I actually had quite a few work-related things I had to finish up so when I started to have those contractions that day I basically just tried to get as much as I could get done so I wasn't worried about it anything else and like trying to finish other things so come Thursday night though Jordan I went to Dairy Queen because I want an ice cream because I love ice cream and popsicles when I'm pregnant and my contractions kind of slowed out I was getting them basically every like three to four hours which is a little bit annoying but the great news about that and this is what I kept telling myself I was like okay well this is good so if they slow down that means I'll be able to sleep tonight which is great because normally when you go into labor it's always like three o'clock and like who wants to go to hospital at 3 o'clock in the morning I'd much rather like sleep throughout the entire night and then come the next day I have the contractions back up again and I go to the hospital because I'll be well rested with aleisea we went in the middle of the night and we were up for like four days straight we didn't really get to sleep well so I honestly was praying and hoping that I would go into labor here during the day so when they stopped at night I was like okay great maybe I'll be able to sleep at night and then maybe tomorrow will happen and that's exactly what happened so Thursday night we were able to sleep the entire night come Friday morning that we woke up I was like okay I'm still not having contractions it's fine like just whatever like just just go about our day but then when I was getting ready I thought I'd peed myself like fully but it was my water that broke but it was like a huge gush and I'm talking a huge gush like in the movies like that actually happened to me so my water broke and I was like okay fabulous in case you didn't know not everyone's water breaks and just because your water breaks doesn't mean you're in labor it can be a little confusing but basically I wasn't in active labor my water had just broken it wasn't happy so we were just chillin but I did test positive for group group the testers would be something like that and basically if you do that means you have to go into labor and delivery when your water breaks because you have to start antibiotics so I've tested positive for allay Thea too so my water broke with her and I had to go in so because of that I had to go in but if you aren't positive for that you could stay at home in like chill out I'm pretty sure you can have your water broken and still be okay for 24 hours or 48 hours or something like that so but because I was positive I had to go in and start those antibiotics so what we basically did though is because it was 8:00 in the morning we finished packing up our bags we hung out with Alethea for a little bit and I was very emotional because I knew that whenever we came back home everything would be very different and not that that would be a bad thing because we were very excited but I didn't know how Alethea would react so I was very like emotional that morning we hung out with her we had McDonald's breakfast I've got a breakfast deluxe we had a breakfast we hung out with her and then we put her down for her nap my sister is here so she was with her then we packed up right after we wanted a hospital and it was just like so calming I don't know if it's because this is my second baby and I kind of like Mew like it doesn't have to be this like pink rush and like all anxious like we were very calm and chill the entire time so I wasn't having contractions but my water broke so he went to the hospital because of copa90 no I did have to get pad tested for Kobe 19 which I was negative of course and then after that we were admitted they confirmed that my water broke and they confirmed that I was still three centimeters dilated which was a little upsetting because I thought I had progressed more than that but that's okay and then we were admitted and we were just chilling at the hospital I wasn't actively where wasn't really having any contractions they just wanted me on the antibiotics so I just chilled at the hospital I did my makeup I'm like trying to keep myself busy Jordan I work facetiming and like playing games listening to music we were just like having just a chill little day before the madness of life continued on after having two babies I slowly started to have some contractions they were anywhere between five to ten minutes apart so and they weren't super intense either and at this point we had already been there for like six hours so we got there at 12:00 around 6:00 is when I started to like naturally get into labor so at that point I was very excited I was like okay good what I'm gonna do is let my body do its thing I was natural at this point so I was bouncing on the ball walking around because of Kobe 19 we couldn't walk in the halls so I try my best to open up my body and like let my buddy move to like really get him to go down what I did was Alethea that I think potentially put me into labor longer because it was 30 hours was that I wasn't moving I wasn't like staying active and like letting and helping my body do its thing so this time around I was like I'm not sitting still like I'm moving him flowing and like picturing everything opening like I really wanted to help my body do its thing I was doing that for a little bit now at this point my nurse that was in there wasn't the nicest nurse and I like hesitate to say this because nurses especially labor delivery nurses are always so sweet in such genuine people I don't know if she woke up on the runs it was bad I don't know if something happened back at home and like she had other things on your mind I never know so that's like why I hesitate to say but she was so mean to me guys she was so mean and that like I was really trying to be as nice to her as possible I was trying to be as sweet as possible like really like talk to her and like I don't know I was trying to just help her like me because she did not like us at all like every time she came in she was being so mean so that was really sour and like that was a little bit annoying to deal with but I kid you not guys ii miss lady left I went to full-blown labor and I think it's because I was finally able to relax and calm down and just let my body do its thing because even though I was trying to do that the fact that she kept being so like mean to us and like just she would just like make me sit still when I was trying to have contractions like there's just like I'm not gonna go into it but I'll just say that she wasn't being very nice and I think that that was like in my subconscious and the second she left and my new nurse came in and my new nurse was like patting my back and rubbing my back and being so sweet like I went into active labor so at that point it was probably eight o'clock ish and they had actually started me on pitocin because I wasn't really progressing that quickly and because my water had broken they were getting a little bit nervous and then around 9 o'clock in swine I really started to go into like global and active labor and I was also on pitocin they my pitocin was that like a level 10 I think like they really hadn't cranked up and I was trying to go his natural for as long as possible my goal wasn't really to go natural all the way cuz I'm so afraid of like pushing and feeling hearing the fire so it's like I'm just gonna try to go like labour natural as long as possible and then like one things start to get bad then I'll get the other girl but at this point like Jordan was my ride-or-die guys he was being so sweet this entire labour he was so involved with every contraction I was having I was having really bad like back labor and he was sunny-side-up so because of that like it was just such intense pain and you can see in the videos Jordans like aggressively massaging my back to kind of like combat each contraction but around 9:00 I started having them every minute apart and I I could not stand I was I stripped all my clothes off somehow I was black naked in every kind of position you could ever think of like up on the bed down here with my butt up in the air with my boob hanging off the side like I was doing any of everything to like hold my mighty open up and Jordans like trying to massage me and like all of this and I was like okay these contractions are just so close together because I was on the pitocin so they slowed the pitocin down just a little bit and then I was trying to get the epidural I finally got pepper girl and it didn't work the one thing that burger was supposed to do it didn't do so I was so confused I was having such intense pain like in my stomach area but like oh it was really bad so after that I was like something's wrong like this isn't working then I started to have labor shakes and I did not have this the first time but literally you're you just shake so aggressively and you can't stop I could not fall asleep I couldn't do anything so finally the doctor came back in and gave me like another dose like an extra dose of epidural and it started to work think the Lord so at this point is around 9:30 10 o'clock somewhere around there so I went into active labor around 9:00 and he was born at 4:00 in the morning so I was in labor for about six hours which I was so happy about that it wasn't for that lungs after I finally got my dose and I was able to like relax she was like okay he's sunny-side up let's put you in different positions in the bed that will help him flip and kind of help him get down because they kept feeling like he was stuck because of the position he was in so when you're when you do get covered early have to stay in bed so I would lay forward like with my belly hanging down I would lay sideways with the ball between my legs this nurse was so sweet it's so sweet guys I love her so much like nurses are really just the best if you have a really good nurse your labor it will like make your labor experience that much better so she was so sweet always helping me switch and move things around and because I was having those shakes I could not fall asleep so I was just talking to her just chatty I wasn't in any pain it was just like having to move me consistently to try to get to go down so the doctor comes in and she checked me and I think I was in a seven or something like that I can't really remember it gets a little foggy because at this point it was like 1:00 in the morning so that she saw that I was out of seven and she was like okay that's fine like rest a little bit and I was like okay that's fine so then I was I the shakes kind of stopped and she had me in a position and sleeping for maybe like 30 minutes or so and then I felt like I had to poop and when you feel like it's a poop it means the baby is pretty much there and it's time to push so I kept talking myself like me am I feeling like I have to poop is it just in my mind like is it like maybe it's not is it and I just kept like for at least 15 minutes I kept like going back and forth if I should tell her that I have to poop but that I feel like I have to push and then I finally told her so she was like okay that's fine I'll get the doctor but the doctor was a little bit busy the hospital was busy there were so many Labor's and deliveries going on at the same time I was there that all the doctors were busy with c-sections or busy with other deliveries so the nurse was like okay that's fine do you mind if I check you and I was like yeah that's fine let's do it like let's see how far along I am I kid you not she goes up and she goes okay you're definitely 10 centimeters dilated like why don't you just do a practice push just so I can gauge and see how long it's gonna take because they say what the second maybe your push time is a lot shorter cuz your body remembers what to do and since my babies are only 16 months apart like my body had recently done all of this so she goes okay let's to do practice push real quick normalcy and I did a practice Bush and she goes okay you need to stab me and you just I mean you stop I have to go get the doctor like this big he's coming now and I was like like I was so excited so he came down in that one push he came down a lot and so Jordan was actually sleeping so I was like baby wake up like it's baby time it's pushed time pushing was my favorite time even though it's two hours long it didn't feel like two hours and it's just such an exciting time because that's the moment you're finally going your baby and that's the thing like I was so excited about all this and such in a happy mood because at the end of the data you get to bring one of these things home like it's worth it all and honestly it's it's not scary I know it may seem scary but your body was literally made to do this and you can do this so if any of you are scared just tie yourself like my body was literally me it's a birth children like that's what it was made to do so you can do it so Jordan wakes up grabs a leg the nurses come in and I pushed four times and he was born so when you push it took about 10 to 15 minutes it's like oh I haven't like all saved on video but when you do your pushes to you're pushing through your contractions so there were a couple of times we were talking and we kind of missed a couple of contractions so we had to wait till a new one would come but in four pushes Jordan says four and a half so four and a half pushes this little guy came out and it was so sweet and when I was pushing actually his head was there for a little bit and they told me to touch his head and I didn't touch her like his head but I really wanted to touch his head but I was a little bit scared and his head was so squishy first of all I did not realize how squishy their heads work   your vagina it has to be black but now every time I touched his head it like brings me back to that moment and Ellen Fischer actually said the same thing and I was like it's so true like every time I touch right here it just takes me back to when I touched his head for the first time but it was such a sweet moment and I remember when his head did come through here like oh he is like really light blond hair and I was like blond hair what like my hair is naturally a little bit lighter than this it's like a light brown but I was so confused I'm like wait what and then when he came out he was so tiny and so little I think he was six pounds eight ounces a lengthy it was six pounds ten ounces so we just have smaller babies I'm very small and petite I'm five five - I know feel like people don't know how short I am but we make little babies so it was such an exciting moment and he was crying and all just making all his little noises like he's making right now I don't know peep in here but if it finally came out and then it was just pure bliss and it was so sweet and it was so nice I pushed out my well sent out and I was I'm always so curious to see the placenta because I think it's so interesting that that like entire thing is inside of you along with the baby think the Lord I only tour in three places which was nowhere in the year like where you pee so after I gave birth I didn't have to use that water thing and I could pee and not have let this insane brain issue which I did with little a Thea I had internal stitching in like basically stitch it everywhere you could possibly think of but for him I just had it in three places and what if I'm like was I don't even know if they can say this so it wasn't even painful at all so that was a blessing in itself and I could definitely talk about Lake Mary recovering if you guys would want to as well or if you want to hear about that but yeah and then he came into the world and then I was just like super emotional and just so excited and I was so happy and excited to go home because I couldn't wait for them to meet each other and for her to see him and I mr. leafy a lot too I kept crying multiple times during labor because I really missed her and I wanted to see her and I wish that she could be there I don't know how she would have like reacted I would have loved for her to see him come into the world but maybe he thought will choose a little bit too young so maybe was the next baby she'll be able to see them come in and hopefully cope it will be done and over with so we'll be able to tap people in the room that is my labor experience and story with him I'll never forget it and it was honestly like if I if I could tell you my perfect labor it was this like I was only in labor for six hours I was able to rest that night before it was a quick push time like all of it I was so thankful and so happy that it went well so if any of you pregnant right now I'm telling you just push and pray it won't work out it will all be fine if you have a vaginal delivery a c-section if you don't breastfeed if you do breastfeed if you delay the clerk if you don't delay it like whatever you end up doing it's gonna be fine and it's gonna be very exciting experience so that is my story oh oh granite tough it's here for outside oh I have to show you guys our patio it's like not done just yet but it'll be done soon but the concrete guys are here and they're gonna install the the granite guys are here and they're going to install the countertops for the outdoor kitchen so great timing on that but I hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to subscribe down below I love you so much don't forget to follow me on Instagram to see like everyday behind the scenes of life and see this little snuggly bug all the time I love you guys and I'll see you in my next video hi how you work out wow hey guys good morning okay so i just finished my workout i'm sorry i should put a tap on because these boobies are out of control being when i breastfeed my boobs literally will grow like three cup sizes so and like i always forget that so my sports bras don't always like cover all the cleavage but um but today's video is going to be my morning routine and showing you guys what that has looked like the past five weeks so this part where i'm like doing my own thing in the morning is something new i started doing this last week because i quickly realized that with two kids you get zero time by yourself ever like if you do not make time you will never have a long time you will just neglect yourself and burn out i'm a big like promoter for moms being able to put themselves first and take care of themselves as well just because your mom doesn't mean you have to like completely neglect yourself and your needs and your mental health and because i still am like fresh from giving birth i'm still very high at being able to get postpartum depression and that's something i'm very scared of i didn't get it with alathia i probably got like baby blues a little bit so this time around i was i'm trying to be very proactive about trying to prevent that as much as i can because i feel like with two it's even easier to get postpartum depression because you just have so much more to deal with and so many other things going on anyway so just last week i started waking up about two hours before everyone else wakes up so i have time to get a workout in for an hour and then either shower get myself ready for another like half an hour-ish so as you guys saw this morning first thing i did was feed ari so that he's good for at least two to three hours and so that i can work out without having like milk explode everywhere in my you know the girls bouncing all around and then after that i literally just put on my workout clothes and then i will make my coffee and while i'm drinking my coffee i will do my devotional or morning time today i've read through james and i love the book of james if you guys haven't read through the book of james it's really short i highly recommend you try doing that um today or tomorrow like it's really easy to get through but i read james and i do that because i don't eat before i work out so i just have my coffee so that's what i did i had my iced coffee this morning and then i read that while i'm drinking that and then i come in here and work out for a little bit so i normally do either i've been doing a couple of different things sometimes i'll just make up a workout that's what i did today sometimes i will do workouts that i have on openfit which is like an app that i it's like a fitness app um sometimes i'll do youtube videos different things i'm always like changing it up to keep it different but um normally i asked jordan not to bring alysia in here because if she comes in here then she wants to stay in here and then it's a little bit distracting and hard to get my workout in and kind of defeats the whole purpose of me being alone so he normally doesn't do that but right now as i just finished i'm going to go upstairs sneak upstairs so nobody sees me and i am going to shower and get ready for the day but i loved this routine so far because it gives me at least at least an hour of just like alone time of me time and i asked jordan i was like dude you really need to like figure it out like i know mornings are hard or like i know it's like a lot going on but i do that all day long so if you could do that for an hour for me while i can get my workout in and like get ready and dress for the day i would appreciate it so he has been super helpful and like okay with doing that which i really appreciate um because he gets his gym time every day so why can't i get my gym time every day you know uninterrupted we're both parents here 50 50 of us so we both need to do 50 50 of the work so um i'm gonna go back inside i'm gonna get ready   wait before i go in the shower i always ask jordan if he can at least make the bed so i don't have to do it but look you made the bed over samson because samson doesn't get up when we get up he normally likes to sleep in so we can never make the bed because he's not only sleeping hi season good morning but jordan literally made the bed over him there was like a huge bump right here   so okay now my mommy time is basically done until the next morning tomorrow but something i forgot to mention to you guys is that while i'm working out i try my best to drink a whole cup of water because of breastfeeding i always feel like i don't know it's probably just a myth but i feel like i have to drink even more water because of breastfeeding and working out i don't want to like keep i want to make sure to like be eating enough calories and like drinking enough water but i came up here to show you guys my vitamins and thank you to carob for working on today's video with me so if you guys have been here before you know that i'm a huge fan of care of i originally started taking him back when i was two months pregnant for late with lazio so it's almost been about two years since i've been taking them but they come in a very cute little dispenser like this makes it very convenient for you not to forget to take your vitamins i'm guilty of forgetting sometimes but i've been getting better i promise you like the dispenser makes it super easy if you just pull out exactly what you need for the day it'll have your name on it and then all the vitamins that you need to take for the day so these are my vitamins i'm still taking your prenatal because they say if you're breastfeeding to continue taking it so i still am i have fish oil iron and a couple of other things in here um but i'm constantly changing it so if you guys go on their website you can take a five minute quiz it's like meeting one-on-one with a nutritionist you'll let them know like how much sleep you're getting what your diet consists of if you're gluten or dairy-free uh or if you're vegan like anything like that if you feel like you have brittle nails or your hair could be growing a little faster you kind of just let them know what it is that you think you could be working on and they will calculate that all in and tell you exactly what you need which i think is really cool i do have a new code with them it's elena c to get 25 off your first three months then that way you'll get three months worth of supply of this for 25 off so i think that's a really good deal i will link this down below and write out my code for you guys if you guys want to check that out but i like to take this before i eat my breakfast um like you guys know i already had my coffee but i haven't eaten anything yet i kind of like working out on an empty stomach i will have my coffee though because i don't want to get a headache and i feel like it kind of is like my pre-workout i don't take pre-workout when i'm breastfeeding um but i feel like it kind of helps me like wake up but then once i come inside i'll make sure to finish my water if i didn't already finish that during my workout i'll have my vitamin and then i'll eat my breakfast drink more water like i just keep refilling that all day long but jordan did just make me some breakfast so let's go see what we got yummy yummy yummy yummy you want my toast please little mini omelette oh yeah it's you two a couple berries they're right here can you see your teeth   it's so hard not to just squeeze her to death every day little baby boy so and his cute little jammies oh my goodness oh he's so cute look at his little lips so we're gonna get his skin figured out at first i thought it was baby acne and i think a part of it is baby acne but he's definitely allergic to something that i'm eating probably oh did you see that did you see oh   he is so darling so darling but i definitely think he's alerted to something that i keep eating either eggs dairy i don't really like eat dairy though that's the thing someone said bluton i feel like there's just so many things honey look at his poor skin and his acid reflux i say try not putting him out at a 95 degree day wearing a sweater and a blanket it's not a heat rash honey because if it was it would go away yes hi are you all done eating no okay i'm gonna feed baby brother then we can go and walk hey babe i think we should focus on some podcasts actually yeah i was actually thinking about that too i was like i feel like my workload right now feels manageable yeah i was like wait why is that because i'm still uploading twice but it's because we're not doing the podcast so we're gonna plan some episodes out okay okay so because of his reflex i make sure to change his diaper or change his clothes or whatever before i feed him so i don't have to lay him back down um so because as if you guys know like having them upright is like the best thing to help them um so he's getting hungry my boobs feel like they're about to explode so i'm gonna take him out of his pjs which are the cutest little pjs ever these are from amazon i found them when i was still pregnant but stretch stretch stretch stretch i've been having so much fun buying boy clothes guys boy clothes to me is honestly cuter than girl clothes i don't know why but it's so fun picking out his little outfits every morning hi   sunshine   sorry that i don't know why the camera is doing that but one thing that we've been doing with hello now that she's a little bit older and her like vocabulary is a little bit better so we've been doing um her affirmations so i kind of change up the wordage every day but one key thing i always try to do is first thing in the morning whenever she wakes up or um when she's like hair messy like teething brush she's still in her jam and make sure to let her know that she is beautiful and she herself is beautiful because i found myself like putting her bows on and like putting her outfit on and then telling her she's beautiful and i was like wait i don't want her to get the idea that these clothes bows and stuff is what makes her beautiful she is beautiful because she is beautiful not regardless of like what she's wearing so i know that may like sound really small and really simple but i promise you i feel like it's making a big difference so duty you ready to do your affirmations please read the affirmations yes i am beautiful bye yeah i am beautiful i am worthy no you want to pray wanna pray we can pray am i praying no what would you you want to finish your affirmations yeah okay i am loved i am   i am worthy i am loved i am beautiful i'm alathia all right even though she like isn't saying i'm back still totally fine that's normal she's i mean she's working on it she goes i i i but at least she's hearing me tell her that because okay often enough we don't get told the things that we are instead we get told the things we aren't and most of the time the things that we aren't are the negative things so if we're constantly told the things that we are and the good things and the positive things that's what we'll remember and that's what will stick with us so that's what i'm really trying to teach her and trying to really give her that confidence and give her that love so that when tough times do come or later down the road she is firm in her foundation of who she is and who christ made her you okay ready put this on ready okay are you ready did you okay   let me see your romper let me see turn this way whoa i'm cute elisa do you want to walk in the grass want to do some grounding yep okay okay walking the grass let me grasp in the grass what was that is that his fart are   five four three two   one     wasn't quite enough liquid   okay mr ari is taking his second nap of the day your third nap of the day i think this is the second one jordan just put alexia down for her nap so it's almost noon she normally goes down around noon but lately okay so she dropped her second nap so she's been doing like noon to three but recently she hasn't been sleeping for the full three hours some days she'll sleep like an hour and a half some days she'll sleep two hours which has been very difficult for me to try to get anything done during that time i feel like for at least an hour i'm taking care of ari and doing stuff with him and then by the time i'm done with him then i start working which only leaves me like barely any time so um try to get her on a better schedule though like yeah i'll leave you up at eight mm-hmm earlier 10 30 or 11. yeah it gives me more time during the business days yeah and that's the thing like i try to get as much as i can during like nine to five hours because that's like when i need to talk to people um because i mean i can always work at night but then i'm not able to ask people or like email people or ask questions or just do emails and stuff so that is all for today's video that is what our morning routine normally looks like you guys like this video don't forget to subscribe down below and give this video a big thumbs up and i'll see you guys in our next video bye hey guys welcome back to my channel today's video i have jordan and ahri my two little plays with me and we're gonna be doing a q a we asked you guys to ask us some juicy questions i'll ask very juicy questions i wasn't expecting that we're not going to answer the super juicy ones because some of them were very inappropriate but yeah we definitely could not monetize this video with some of those questions no so we're going to answer the questions you guys asked on instagram mr ari is going to be here he's a super noisy baby so we hear grunts and farts don't mind him yeah all right so molina letting me pick the questions this time so i wrote out just a list of a bunch of them so we're just gonna ramp it fire through first up what is your guys favorite starbucks drink okay so i feel like jordan picked this one because we like created our own starbucks drink when we were in high school what's it called a double chocolate chip with white mocha yeah it tastes like you're drinking an oreo so there's no coffee in it or anything but it's literally just a sugary drink full of dairy so if you want to drink that and like poop your guts out go for it it's just really sugary but i also like their nitro cold brew so it's pretty basic but i like the cold brew stuff especially in the summer when it's really hot when is the podcast coming back well we were planning on starting back this august uh in a couple weeks but i have to travel for work now for a couple months and i'm gonna be kind of intermittent back and forth i don't know exactly how much off time i'll have to be able to record the episodes with melana so the short answer is hopefully august the longer answer is it could be you know a little bit later after that like end of september so we'll keep you guys posted make sure to follow us on instagram we're going to start back up on the page there uh as well as the ask for me my house podcast page on facebook and we'll be posting updates there as we uh kind of figure out more all right next question do you get annoyed at jordan making messes since you're so tidy well wait a second i take i take issue with this because you're assuming that i make messes and you're assumed correctly she's so tidy assumed correctly as well this person just knows us very well um what was the question do i get annoyed yeah of course right yes yeah i mean like i would say i i try not to get as annoyed because i'm like okay maybe my standard of tidiness isn't as high as jordan's so big i will say it and she'll even admit i'm pretty clean okay but just because you know how to shower doesn't mean you're very close i don't know like i don't know i can always tell where jordan's been around the house i call it his vomit he loves to leave vomit throughout sprinkle a little here sprinkle a little there sprinkle yeah like a little put it over here over there sprinkling vomit is not it's not the proper you get what i'm saying if any of you girls are married and you have a husband you know what i'm talking about like guys like leave his boxers like as soon as he's done showering he'll like put his clothes over there okay well i could say the same thing about you vomiting your hair in the sink and in the shower okay that is that that's out of my control i'm just saying next question how do you schedule your day i don't know if they met like our work day our like normal life day i think just like how do you get stuff done in the day or how to prioritize things i personally love to wake up early i'm a big morning person so for me it's easy for me to get up early and get stuff done before the kids wake up and so i've been like working out if you guys saw my morning routine i'll link it up here but basically i try to get like the annoying things done first thing in the morning before the kids wake up so like work out clean the kitchen pick up stuff and like do all of that so that when alathia wakes up and ari wakes up and he looks so cute right now he's just like um i can just be with them and then whenever they go down for their nap is when i work and try to get as much as i can done and then we do have help from jordan's mom and my mom as well so like each day berries who comes here or if they go there or whatever alathia is a very busy girl if you guys know this like she's always doing something and loves to be doing things at all times so i try my best to like schedule activities for her and like have sensory play planned out and all done like i guess that's how i get my stuff done because if she's entertained and taken care of then i can keep myself entertained and do the things that i need to do but like i just everything is really planned out in advance with the newborn it's a little bit more difficult with him i just kind of go with his flow but we've really been sticking to elenathia's schedule since you've been bored because her schedule is consistent i'll say for me i like to schedule my day by listing out like all the tasks and things i need to get done usually like i'll triage it by most important and most pressing to least and then i'll just kind of put time frames into it and work that around kind of build everything out around our normal routine or like whatever melania's doing i'll try to collaborate with her say hey honey do you need help with this or do you need me to help you film that or you need me you know and then i can kind of figure out where exactly i need to build in my nap time and my um bathroom time and all that stuff yeah jordan will always send me a list in the morning he'll always send me a list in the morning of like maybe his to-do list of time that he's going to be doing certain things so i just give myself like a window so if i know something's gonna take an hour i usually give myself like an hour and a half or if i'm like driving somewhere i include the drive time plus whatever the actual thing is that i'm doing instead of just thinking like oh yeah i forgot it's gonna take 30 minutes each way to drive there you know and then there's another hour so um even if i don't get everything done on my list i know i got a lot more done than had i not if i didn't kind of plan everything out so i would encourage people to do that because that's helpful for me so question five baby sleep training tips we used taking care of babies let them cry it out no you don't it's i loved her approach of everything because she really educates you and lets you know why she's doing what she's doing so it's very informative because it was a little bit hard for jordan to do it at first because he didn't want her to move out of her room which is like a requirement but we did the age i just love looking over at night like if i get up to get some water or something i just like look over and she's sitting there you know so that was that was hard to let go at five months you can do the abc sleep training so that's what we did for lathia for him we got the newborn class we have actually yet to finish the course we started some of it but with his reflux and just changes to our routine his kind of like put it off for a little bit and even cara will say we're not giving any spoilers here but she'll say like it's kind of up in the air with a newborn right like you can't within the first month necessarily like that you know change a newborn and get them on a perfect schedule so yeah but she always gives you a lot of great techniques and tips and advice and kind of strategy to go through everything so if you want to check her out and if any of you are moms right now or you're pregnant and gonna be a mom i think it would be a really good idea to add her gift card to your registry so that can like if someone wants to give that to you because i would much rather sleep that's what i was gonna say i'd much rather get that than a cute onesie all right next question what are your thoughts on homeschooling we have had long conversations at length and milan and i both want to homeschool our kids so obviously milan is going to be more involved at home well we honestly we still have to do a little bit of research and like see the curriculum we want to do like the more in-depth stuff of that but kovid definitely solidified it for us because i'm not sure how it is where you live but in most states like they're cutting out recess lunch time arts and crafts kids have to wear masks kids can't be next to each other you have to be six feet apart yeah playing with things you know like interacting by themselves pretty much right and that's a lot more isolating than it would be if we did homeschooling and with homeschooling you might be like okay they're gonna be at home all day well yes but they also have group homeschooling too so that's definitely something that we've really considered and just the curriculum we want to be able to know what our kids are learning and align it with our like biblically so i have actually i actually was i just found a curriculum yesterday that is all about like glorifying god and how god has to do with literally everything especially science which i think a lot of people think that science and god are mutually exclusive but they're not god literally created science so it's just a whole another perspective of everything so yeah we we'd like to we're not some like control freak parents but if you're a christian watching this you can understand and probably share in our concern with what is being taught especially in the united states but even across the world if you're in other countries watching this um just the type of agenda let's just call it what it is but there's an agenda being pushed in our public schools and the theory and the the uh proven wrong theory of evolution uh being taught in science basically like it's fact you know even though not even just that but like i actually ordered us a couple of books last night one of them is called dumbing us down and so it's like in my amazon thing but i can't wait to read those because i feel like that will really just solidify our decision of like you know just how corrupt the education system is and not teachers i have mad respect for teachers but the teachers don't get to pick the curriculum yeah so that's all coming from above and through the different various you know people up high in the education system but um all that to say if you are planning to send your kids to public school it's not like there's no hope or uh we're not trying to completely you know downplay that or we both went to public school yeah it could definitely be done you're just going to have to be more involved as a parent in our in our opinion with your kids and knowing what they're being exposed to so you know how to combat that with the truth right um as far and another thing i wanted to say was it's kind of ironic how there's a stigma surrounding homeschoolers of you know they're socially awkward and they're not as advanced as you know public school kids or whatever but but as melania said with covent now you're going to have an environment where they're perpetuating you know social awkwardness and social anxiety when you can't even get within six feet of somebody like kids are supposed to run around and play tag and you know share toys yeah it's like you can't do that you know climbing on the monkey bars and stuff if all this stuff is roped off and quarantined and you know what's that going to do to our children and their emotional development so i'll get off my pedestal for now but um we'll definitely talk a little bit more yeah on the podcast for sure on some decisions and strategy that we have surrounding homeschool i just think it's definitely changed just as public schools changed in the last 20 30 years here in the u.s so we want to maximize that and yeah make the most of it so how do you guys have intimacy in time for each other with two kids we don't and this is just such a struggle you know and if you're if you're a parent of multiple kids or even just a parent at all you you you understand the struggle because we are so tired at the end of the day they ring you out emotionally and physically and mentally and everything so by the time you come to the end of the day you're already spent like you're you don't have time to do it in the middle of the day if you do have time now enjoy that because you're not going to be like fame let's go upstairs real quick because we have a toddler following oh she's talking about sex okay got it what he said go if you don't have time to do it in the middle of the day like do what yeah it's it's tough you really have to just continually be intentional and check in with each other and have conversations that sometimes might be vulnerable or exposing like hey i'm feeling this way and what can we do and remember that you're a team you and your spouse are a team working with each other not against each other um preaching to myself here but yeah we're definitely you know no better than anyone else when it comes to um putting our kids before ourselves at times and we know that's not how god created it you know yeah he created the husband and wife relationship and then your children and far too often um parents elevate their children above the relationship with their spouse i'm so guilty of that before you know it you kind of like wake up one day or your kids are out of the house or something you're like wait who's a stranger i've been living with for the last who's this of mine yeah so um well definitely another probably another good podcast episode is how to continue that with your spouse yeah we'll do that whenever we figure that out yeah well stay tuned we're still learning ourselves don't just assume everything's okay oh yeah you know we didn't talk at all we said two words for each other today but yeah that's fine that's just how it is that literally happens to us all day there's gonna be seasons in your life where maybe that does happen more often you know more than once but it shouldn't be the norm right so if you have to get away you have to pay a little extra to get a babysitter so you can go out you have to do something you have to god forbid put your kid in front of a tv for 30 minutes and then you and your spouse go not have sex who's who's got the dirty mind here no but like do something fun and intentional and like enjoyable with your just wait until the kid goes to bed or just have sex but yeah that's kind of uh our two cents for now and like wayne and i said you know we're not anywhere near arrived at this yet so uh we're gonna we're living we're living through the heat yeah that's okay you know like too often i think people share their experience on the outs on the other side of you know a circumstance or some sort of trial but not so much in the midst of like hey i'm going through this right now right yeah so with a newborn and a one and a half year old yeah our life is kind of revolved around them right now but we don't want to make them our idol we don't want to elevate them above our relationship you know um obviously they're worth everything but yeah well one thing if nothing else we're equal with you know our kids are equal with us as husband and wife so yeah um i think right now we're really guilty of like like we just do especially with covid we just do everything together all day long so at the end of the day it's like what do we talk about more poopy diapers like i know everything that's going on in your life you know everything that's going on in my life high five go to bed like it's just yeah sometimes it's not so much like talking about things as it is just having a shitty experience you know like if you can we could just talk about like hey honey i really enjoyed doing this with you today or i really enjoyed going here or how you interacted with ari or whatever you know so things like that just complimenting and highlighting certain things so to let the other person know hey i'm involved right yes sometimes making time is just having a well needed conversation so nice oh look at this little froggy legs and froggy boy all right next question what does jordan think about your menstrual cup i think it's the weirdest thing but i see why people use it but it also he's so grossed out i feel weird about putting a cup inside of my body um first time at sex tips well i was gonna make a joke about tips i just did um okay well one thing that we've never shared about is our actual wedding night and i get questions about that pretty frequently um because so we waited until marriage and so people always ask us like if it was awkward or this isn't that and we've never like spoken about it because that was just such a sacred night that we share between us we're pretty open but like we won't share about that night um not because it was horrible or anything but just because it was just such an interesting between us you know yes yeah so we won't like speak on that but i will just say you don't have to do it the first time like if you're getting married like you don't have to do it your wedding night relax you're not going to be a pro i will tell you that for sure yeah you're definitely going to have to like don't force anything don't think you're going to be like some professional mm-hmm yeah just like enjoy like milan i've been married for three years now we're still like exploring new things and trying out new things and you make that sound very strange we are not like weird kinky people i know i like that i'm just saying like we're always like learning new things about it not sexually even though we're in the context of like sex tips but yeah we're always like discovering new things about each other right so that also flows into our intimacy in our bedroom experience so um if you're thinking like oh i need to have all these things perfect the first night just don't even stress it because you're not it's just not gonna happen so um oh and that just know like this is your your husband or spouse or your husband or wife for life so like you're together and you have your whole life to learn about each other yeah and that's why i have such a big problem with the porn industry and all of that because it makes this it makes women feel like they have to do certain things or act certain ways or where certain things to impress their husband or whatever and it's just not realistic and they're comparing themselves to this fake fantasy and like it's just so toxic so i don't even want to start with that but i'm just saying like don't go into it expecting certain things just go with the flow and you guys will figure each other out and it'll be such a learning experience and i don't know i just like appreciate how well we know each other in that aspect yeah i agree well said do you both have similar parenting styles i'd say yes and no really you learn from how you were parented a lot of times but you could also learn from how you were parented right so if there are things that my parents did that i really liked or responded well to as a child from my parents i'm gonna probably put that in my back pocket and say hey i liked how this felt or like my parents interaction with me i'm gonna do that when i'm a parent right or there's certain things that i didn't like i have to kind of ask myself why maybe i'll take note of that and then try not to make that mistake right my parents aren't perfect but they're phenomenal parents so same with milan as parents you know but the more we can learn and improve for the next generation i think the better for the you know the future so we're still learning the whole parenting thing like nobody is given a manual or instructions if they have a kid so it's not like you know and the type of parent and mom that i am now is not what i thought it would be i thought i would be a lot more like harsh and sassy and like i don't know i just am not at all what i thought i would be i'm very patient and calm which is like not like me at all so um i definitely am not the parent that i thought i would be in a good way so i guess joe and i both are just learning together he's very open to learning what i have to share as well because i went to school and i learned early childhood education and i've taken a lot of that into my parenting style um into like what we teach at lathya so i am always willing to share that with him and like he's very open to it and it's not like we're both set on one way and a lot of the things that we do we both agree on i guess the only thing would be more so like sticking to our boundaries because if alathia says please in sign language or says more in sign language he is a sucker and completely melts for her so that's just the only thing but that's something small like it's not a big deal yeah i do like the gentle parenting approach but also tough love so just subtle small things that we're trying to incorporate like melania did the video recently on her affirmations with alafia and i thought that was so sweet because she said and i guilty of this too like you put on a little bone or hair or a pretty dress or whatever and then you say oh you're so pretty oh you're so beautiful it's like well no she's beautiful right the second she wakes up in the morning when she's got the sleepy in her eyes and her hair is a mess and and all that right she's so cute when she likes yeah i mean she is but she'll keep that with her she'll hide that in her heart and tuck that away when she's older and she's getting all this pressure from society in the world saying oh you have to look a certain way or or dress a certain way and then you're beautiful it's like no god's made you beautiful right now as you are so things like that you know melinda's chock full of want i just tried to follow her lead so how do you help your spouse strengthen their relationship with the lord this is the last question save the best for last um yeah it's kind of uh it's kind of ironic because you can't really do too much like on the proactive end really the best thing you can do is just be praying for god to open up your spouse's eyes and your heart so you can help them but it's kind of one of those you can lead the horse to water but you can't make them drink kind of scenarios where you can't shove the bible down someone's throat you can't force your faith life and your experience with the lord on somebody else they have to have that for themselves and melania was like that too early on in our relationship when we started dating like i was all about like hey let's go do this let's go do that um go to this bible study let's go to this meet let's listen to this christian podcast let's watch this bible study video and she's just like kind of like no i i'm not into that or i'm not i don't want to do that and for me i was like well she she doesn't want to do every single thing i want to do and express her relationship with the lord the same way that i do is she not the one for me and then i god had to kind of show me like no there's other ways that he can reach her and use her and all that so she had to kind of do that on her own you know i couldn't do that for her yeah and just because you and your spouse might not be on like the same spiritual walk at the same time like i feel like there are sometimes that i'm just like so on fire for the lord and i'm like so excited and then jordan might not be right there at that second either like your relationship with the lord is always fluctuating so it can be a little bit tricky but with everything with your spouse you will never change your spouse whether it's like in a spiritual way or just like with annoying things well hold on let me go back for a second just to clarify for someone was like wait a second you said your relationship with the lord's always fluctuating i think you make your feelings good fluctuating yeah relationship with the lord's that's it it's it's forever right but you're not always feeling you know like you might not be reading your bible as consistently one month as opposed to the next month they're like with covid it's like it's we're not going to church right now so like it's just it it's always that's definitely getting a spiritual slump but i would say when it comes to your spouse the best way you could lead them is to pray for them and let them know that you're always available um to talk anything or to even just ask them how can i be praying for you or you know but if you're just always like why aren't you reading your bible or come read the bible with me or come to this or come like begging them to do stuff if they don't want to do it don't force it right yeah the holy spirit's not gonna force himself on anyone so um in the right time i know it's like being patient and waiting is hard but trust that the lord and his timing is going to work everything out perfectly all you have to do is pray and be available for that time so i wish there were a better answer but that's just kind of the way god's created us and that way he gets all the glory and we don't right so mr is just throwing his head around he just loves to mosh he's like do you hear his little noises loves head banging but yeah that was all for the questions thank you guys for writing in and hopefully it was a little bit insightful here in our two cents but um yeah we're still learning and and about parenting and relationships and all this stuff so we'll definitely have more conversations on our podcast about these things because we love talking about it and learning from you all and learning from other people who have gone before us so yeah all right guys we love you and we will see you in my next video how do people style these without looking like potatoes how do you style a shirt like this i thought it was supposed to tuck it in okay anyway hey guys welcome back to my channel welcome to today's vlog today's gonna be a basically a day in the life type of video so as you guys know if you watched our q a that i did with jordan she's very busy so if you hear her in the background ma'am is on a mission over there i don't know what she's doing but she's on a mission but if you guys watched our last video jordan i did a q a and he mentioned that he was briefly gonna have to go away for work for a little bit so he's not here he hasn't been here for four days now today he left on sunday and today's thursday so um my mom came and stayed with me for the first two days because taking care of a toddler is totally fine a baby and toddler like it's not bad what's hard to do is literally anything else while watching the kids so with me working it was really hard to get much done and then not to mention i have two of these that need to go out at least five to six times a day and be walked so like leaving the babies to walk them is like really hard and we don't have our fence yet and i really have to pee so i'll be right back okay i'm back sorry i just like can't really hold my pee anymore because if i try to it just like comes out on its own because you know i have two kids now anyway you can probably see ari he's been taking his nap um and i'm actually gonna review or like mention and talk about how the snoo has been so we rented it and there was one night where i literally got maybe one hour of sleep like maybe 45 minutes like an hour may have been a stretch but it was horrible and i was like dude i like can't i can't like wake up every 15 minutes to like shake him yes a bit that's ari's car seat you don't fit in that car seat oh she literally went that's for our even then um so there it's just like i couldn't pick him up every 15 minutes to rock him and all of that so um i like mentioned to you guys that i like regret not getting the snoo and a lot of you were like you can rent it so i've been renting it so far we've only everything we have it rented for a month and honestly i like i think i'm gonna buy it why is it okay delilah's trying to sit on my lap look at look at all of what is here right now be careful the baby be careful please okay i have delilah here already there and then simpson over there so i would say right now my biggest challenge has been helping aletheia grow her brain and i'm like i don't even know if that's like the right wordage i want to say that she's literally crazy but i don't want to say that because it sounds mean but she is very she really wants to learn and explore and play so come here come here mister tell   yeah oh you're such a good sister to him so she just really wants to learn and explore yesterday she was trying dog food she wanted to taste toilet water you know like really good things so i have to really keep her busy and um towards the end of my pregnancy i started to get really bad with like switching and rotating her toys and like doing montessori and like setting up activities for her so i really need to start doing that again because she just i just cannot take my eyes off of her for more than a second guys like for more than a second and with arie she loves him to death and thinks that she can hold him and like she's just so young that she doesn't understand how she can hurt him so i always have to be very careful like as you guys saw she was just trying to pick him up and take him out of his little record hi jason so that's basically what life has been like in a nutshell i wasn't able to work out at all this week well i worked out two days i think but or maybe no i only worked out one day this week because she's been waking up earlier and let me tell you i feel like her days are so much more hectic when i don't get to start off my day like doing my own thing and easing into my mornings so as much as i regret it i'm probably gonna have to start waking up around six to do that which i don't really want to do because i'm really not sleeping that much but the snoo has helped so she's just over here playing with his car seat and he's just over here just chilling he's getting so big he is currently wearing size one diapers and he's wearing zero to three clothes so he was super small and petite when he was born but now he's like really growing quickly um and he's getting so chunky and he smiles at us all day long she basically just like redecorates my decor 15 times a day i was making dinner and i found her reading my coffee table books which is like a decorating book and she was just like sitting there reading it but it's fine i make sure that all my decor stuff is okay if she rips apart and whatnot look i don't really care i honestly really like this is really thick i mean she could break it if she wanted to but it's not gonna fall if it falls it won't break but i've been trying really hard to pick my battles and i pick them very wisely so if she wants to redecorate my decor okay fine go for it like i will there's other things like that's not gonna hurt you it's fine she's exploring whatever so today what i was going to be doing is i'm going to show you guys our backyard um this is taking so long i don't know what it is i think our contractor like took all these jobs at once because of covid and like now that he can start working again so it's been really hard for him to like finish the job he'll like do a little bit here and then come back in the next week a little bit here a little bit there which is fine but it's just taking a little bit longer so i wanted to update you guys okay so we had temporary stairs over on this side but he just made this one out of tricks i would have liked for it to be concrete but it's too heavy to do all of that concrete because we have like a landing space so he still has to add the railing and then he added this in yesterday so we had the kitchen already but he added that fence and my purpose for that fence was for it to be a privacy fence because our neighbors are right over on that side um but the slats are a little bit too big so my mother-in-law had a genius idea of adding some ivy to grow over that and to like make it look really green and leafy so that's what we plan on doing so that's like where the kitchen is and then this side is where like the living space um couch area is so um today i plan on getting some stuff to put some ivy in there i think someone pooped hey   so fast hey hey was it you   you pooped you could poop on your toilet but you already did the poop pee you why do you have a binky are you napping yeah we only use our binky when we're napping can i have it please thank you let's go change the diaper over here all right i have this little basket down here that i keep in there that i have diapers and wipes in this changing pad i already and this is what i used to change them down here because i don't have a changing pad and i'm not about to go all the way upstairs with both kids to change that stinky stinky doo   yes let's clean it pink cup baby bit i wanna know the realness of my mom this is it this is it chasing around a really stinky toddler for 15 minutes to get her to change her diaper yes let's change the diaper so we can go to granny's house ready for grammys are you going to take your mom so i thought i would show you guys something i've been doing differently with my diaper bag so since having two of them i noticed i have to create quite a lot of stuff now and everything was kind of getting like jumbled mumbled and i would spend like five minutes in here trying to decipher what was what yes is your arms your arm is stuck so i have tons of these that are just like little cloth baggies so i got two of them and then one i keep a change of clothes for ari and some diapers and then for lacia some change of clothes and diapers as well and then wipes just kind of go freely in here and then in there i have like my wallet some wipes hand sanitizers um i keep my mask in there so i thought i would share that hack if any of you have two babies as well because this bag fits a lot but sometimes if you shove it too full it becomes really hard to find everything that you need so this is a great way to fit what you need and find what you need when you need it so close that up she is just like so invested in helping him and i haven't even drank my coffee today so i'm gonna chug this i'm gonna chug this real quick and then we're gonna head out okay we're back home we went to the chiropractor um and mr ari got adjusted so his pediatrician actually was one that told me to go get him adjusted so don't send me any hate i'm just following doctor's orders here um and they say it's really good to get your baby checked if they have like acid reflux or anything like that he said his hips were out of place and so was his neck so he adjusted him and i also got adjusted let me show you guys my back because i have no idea what it's from but i have like this giant purple bruise okay just like change the setting on the camera because it's so yellow but i have this giant spot excuse all my rollage okay excuse the rollage it's just the way life is now um but can you see it right here i don't know if the camera is going to pick it up but it's so painful like so painful when i'm like breastfeeding i feel like i'm always like bent over like that i try to have like good posture when i'm breastfeeding but sometimes really hard because he'll like latch really well and i'm like oh i'm not gonna move because he's comfy so i'll sacrifice but so let's talk about the snoo so in case you guys aren't familiar this doctor created it that was a sleep expert baby sleep expert something like that he created it um and it basically is a bassinet that will like put your baby to sleep if they start waking up so i was very hesitant to buy it because it's very expensive it's like a thousand some dollars and i was afraid that i would buy it and then him not like it because we have the mamaroo and that's like another like swing mechanism and alathia loved it so we had it from when we had her but then i kept it for ari and already hated it so i was afraid of spending all that money and then him not liking it i tried looking on facebook market to see if they had any used ones this is not sponsored by the way i'm just they have no idea who i am they're not paying me i don't have an affiliate nothing like that um i'm just sharing like my opinion on it so far but couldn't find it on facebook market to buy it used i wanted to buy use couldn't find it but then you guys let me know that you could rent it so it's like 113 a month to rent it um you have to pay like a deposit fee and then you have to pay for like a 50 cleaning service or something like that so i was like you know what okay fine i'll try it out for a month see if he ends up liking it and then if he does and then i'll just buy it to me it's gonna be worth it to buy it because we want to have at least two more kids so for me i'll be getting three kids uses out of it so i basically divided by three and then i feel like i justified the price that way but if you only have one kid or only plan on wanting having one kid i don't think it's worth it unless you know a family member or if you like want to sell it after and then see how much money you can get out of it but again sleep is kind of priceless so once you're like only getting an hour of sleep it becomes very worth it so honestly i do really like it for the first month though so he was waking up very frequently and then around a month years around a month is like when they kind of stop waking up as frequently and they go longer stretches so honestly i feel like it would be kind of useless the first month of their life maybe not i don't know i didn't have it until he was a month old but i prefer a lot more during the day so at night he wakes up to eat regardless of this machine so if your baby is waking up because they want to eat like they're going to cry because they want to eat so that doesn't really help but sometimes during the night he will kind of like rough full up a little and like cry a little bit and that will like soothe him back down but he doesn't do that as much so for the night time to us it's not very helpful because he just cries to eat so i feed him and that's it but during the day nap time during the day this thing is amazing because during the day he has a really hard time like staying a steadiest like sleep time so this has been wonderful because it puts him to sleep and keeps him asleep so it's really nice because i am able to be with alathia or work and not have to like constantly be like bouncing around with him i have him strapped in right now just with the body part there is this thing right here that's like the actual swaddle but they have to be swaddled with their arms down and he doesn't like his arms to be down so i don't use that i normally just put this tummy part he probably has to fart or something that's why he's like a little upset but this is the baseline so as you can see it has like the sound and it's just like subtly moving him you just turn it on with like a button if he starts to cry and i don't know that he'll cry right now but so it's saying that ari is calm it's on the baseline if he starts to cry more it will automatically start going and moving more and the loud the sound will get louder so i can control it but the thing also will detect it so i'm just going to turn it up just so you guys can see so see it's like moving a little bit more that's level one level two   and then it goes all the way up to level four and it does get pretty vigorous but i mean it's safe i guess i hope so that's basically it so is it worth it if you have the means i do think it's worth it so if you're able to maybe just rent it for a month or two or maybe put it on your baby registry like as a gift card or something of like um someone like renting it for you i don't know get creative with it that's like what i would suggest but okay while he's snapping i thought i would do a little haul i have been ordering a couple of things here and there just because i'm not pregnant anymore and i'm not like nearly as small as i once was which is fine but i just like feel like my style of clothing is changing and because i know i'm not going to be pregnant for a minute like i kind of like wanted to buy some like cute things and just like different style i bet you guys have noticed that i've changed my style a little bit i've been using more like comfy things like i feel like if i get like dressed up and like look super cute i'm literally gonna have to change my outfit in five seconds anyway so like why even bother so i've been really into like athleisure wear but like cute act leisure wear you know like something that is easy to breastfeed in is fine if i get spit up on it like this i really like because it's a button up i can button it down i have a hat on because my hair is really greasy i'm washing it tomorrow and i just have like shorts on so it's like super easy just like comfy stuff so i just wanted more like basic loungewear and i also wanted cute workout clothes so if like one morning i work out and i'm done with my workout and i don't end up having time to change a shower which has happened quite a few times because like alethia wakes up and just like the day ends up going by so fast i wanted to get some workout stuff that would be really cute to wear like as normal clothes so i actually found this set right here on amazon it's pretty vibrant um it's just like biker shorts and a sports bra so i thought that was cute i could easily just like throw on like a zip up over it to make it a little bit more modest um and these are all from either amazon or boohoo or misguided i can't remember it's just like random stuff that i have ordered i also got this other hat that says like los angeles on it these are just great because i feel like just looks makes your outfit look cute i also got these biker shorts from amazon i have these exact pair already in a white so i got it in like this nude color which i think is really pretty i just love biker shorts i got this matching set biker shorts as well these look really cheap though like you can see pretty through these but it does have a longer tap so hopefully that will cover my butt but i just really liked that so i don't know if you can tell but he's like starting to huff and puff and the thing is moving a little bit faster so it'll like just like soothe him which is very convenient in the middle of the day like this i also got this other matching set with like a gray gray matching set i've been into like sweatpants and whatnot um i got these nude sweatpants and then i think this is the thing i'm most excited about because i've been struggling really hard to find bathing suits because of breastfeeding like i'm just a little bit larger on the top than usual and sometimes i feel like they're just like not large enough so i found this which i think is really cute and then it has like this high-waisted bottom i also got a couple of pjs for lathium these are from amazon these are my favorite pjs ever it's such a good quality in their matching sets um they're like really gooey i don't know if you can tell but i got her a couple of these um they've been coming in in like random orders but i also got that i got a couple of like just normal crop tops just to throw on with like sweats or just like oversized things um and then last thing is this little sweater that's like scrunched up at the top so it would look cute with biker shorts or like i'm working out and it's a little bit cooler in the morning but yeah i'll try to find links to all of those i don't know if you guys like when i link things sometimes i feel like if i do link it people are like oh why do you like so much stuff and then when i don't people like why don't you link things i'm like that so i don't know what to do so let me know if you like when i link things that are mentioned throughout the video um but i think i'm gonna end this vlog here i hope you guys enjoyed it i have really been enjoying you guys and just vlogging and the way that you guys have been so sweet and respectful of me not being so consistent with my uploading like i really appreciate it and i love you and i'll see you in my next video bye well well well good morning guys welcome back to my channel today's video i'm going to be doing a what i eat and drink in my life video um so i haven't done one of these in a very long time i think the last time i did this i was like 18 weeks pregnant or something i was still pregnant with ari so now i'm almost two months postpartum and i am breastfeeding um i was gluten and dairy free previously now i would say i'm like i do like the whole 90 20 thing like 90 or not 90 20 80 20. sorry 80 of the time i try not to eat dairy or gluten and then 20 like weekends and whatnot i will um the reason why i was during gluten free was because of my ulcerative colitis but that is currently in remission and me eating dairy and gluten hasn't really affected it so it's very early right now i honestly do not want to be up at all i'm very tired ari was up so much last night um so you already know i'm gonna drink a lot of coffee i emphasized that i was gonna do a day in the life i wanna eat and drink because i drink many liquids throughout the day so i wanted to share those okay so first thing i have every single morning is coffee i cannot cannot hoops without coffee and with breastfeeding you can still have coffee obviously talk to your doctor but ma'am still has coffee like i don't know how i would but throughout the entire night i always have my yeti and i will drink this entire thing like only have a couple sips left the coffee that i make i've gotten so many of you on it too so i will get the cold brew from starbucks i get the unsweetened one in medium sometimes i'll get the dark roast too because that one's really good but then this is the game changer so i try not to have dairy frequently but it's so hard to find a dairy free creamer that actually tastes good or like doesn't get clunky and chunky when you put it in coffee which like oat milk will do that almond milk so it was really hard but i'm so happy i found this so it is a coconut milk creamer and then it's sweet cream so it's already sweetened so i have a little bit of ice here i drink a generous amount so i'm about to work out i normally wake up about an hour and a half before the kids wake up so they're both up there sleeping i have their monitors on um i will wake up before so i can get a quick workout in drink my coffee in peace do my morning devotional um and i don't eat before i work out i just drink my coffee i kind of treat it like a pre-workout so i'm gonna have this while i do my devotional and then i'm gonna work out it's so good it's like the perfect amount of coffee to creamer ratio like it's sweet but not too sweet where it's like this is just straight up sugar and there's not that much sugar in this either so i'm gonna fill up this cup because i'm breastfeeding i'm still a little skeptical of like sweating too much or just losing too many calories so i try to like really make sure i'm drinking even more water than i normally would because i'm like sweating and working out in the morning so i try to drink a full yeti during my workout after i have this so i'm like peeing a lot but i'm gonna chug this then once i'm done working out i'll show you guys what i actually eat for breakfast because i do eat breakfast just down before my workout okay oh what do you have a snack well we have to eat breakfast first would you like to cut up some bananas while i make us some eggs mm-hmm hi okay so i cook breakfast for alexia and i normally jordan would but he's not here one thing i've been doing in the mornings is i will give her like a task to do so yeah yeah you want to cut you want to cut some bananas okay okay okay yep you can cut the banana yes so i give her her own cutting board and then this tool right here it's actually called a wedger but it's very safe it's not sharp at all but it does cut through soft things such as bananas so i will give her this to eat and cut while i make us some eggs so we honestly have eggs pretty much every day i just love eggs and so does she and then we'll have like some type of meat with it too so i like to have a big breakfast because i just worked out so i'm very hungry and tired from that and with breastfeeding i like myself yeah whoa whoa you got your banana eat it um so i went like pretty much all night without eating anything so i'm very hungry so i like to make sure to eat like a really big breakfast so eggs with some type of fruit and veggies oh we're potty training right now and she just peed all over herself do you have to go party you just okay yeah yeah okay brb   yep that's my mind's food here's mr ari he's just chilling he loves to be inside of this little what is this thing called a play thing all right this is what our breakfast looks like nothing super fancy i got some grapes out for us too and then we are both just drinking waters so this is my second cup of water today okay you'd like to pray and yeah i think you want to pray who would you like to pray you want re to pray okay i can pray you want moment to pray okay thank you jesus for another beautiful morning today i pray that we'll have a great rest of the week and thank you for the yummy food in jesus name we pray amen um excuse me you already have some that's your plate all right guys it's been a couple of hours now i've changed my outfit i had full throw up peed the whole shebang on it alathia has peed everywhere except for in the potty today so that's how potty training is going but i'm gonna make myself some lunch it's actually three o'clock right now i feel like because of a lazy's nap schedule i end up eating lunch a lot later because that's when she eats it so because she naps around 12 she'll not from like 12 to 3ish she will eat breakfast before she goes down but she won't have lunch she'll have lunch when she wakes up so that's normally when i will eat it too just so i can eat it with her but i will either have leftovers or a big salad and i'm gonna have a big salad today so i'm using this baby spring mix which is my favorite because it has arugula it has spinach it has just like basically everything in there so i don't think this is good okay well i'm gonna try to salvage what i can you know what i saw someone said when you buy your salad to put a piece of paper towel here close it and then flip it over so the water doesn't get cause you know like when it gets stuck at the bottom that's a good idea i'm gonna start doing that okay so anyway i'm gonna use and salvage what i have and then in my salad i always like to put some type of meat so well or like some type of protein i mean so i have a rotisserie chicken so i like to get that at least once a week just to have for lunch snacks just to like give to alethia or i'll do salmon so i'll buy salmon burgers and i'll warm those up and kind of like shred it onto there um what else oh tuna i've been loving tuna inside a salad so i'll make like a two nine just like throw it in there basically you can just add so much to a salad and make it so good so my mom made this for me the other day and it was amazing so i love to incorporate fruits into my salads and different types of toppings so i always get these honey roasted walnut pieces that are really good so i'm gonna throw some of that in and then for my fruit i'm gonna add grapes so i'm gonna cut grapes in half and add that sometimes i'll add um strawberries or pears pears are so good pear and goat cheese on a salad it's so good tomatoes olives like there's so many different configurations that you can do so i'm gonna toss these in here also i got these containers from crate barrel i think and i think they're so convenient and so nice to just wash your strawberries or grapes or whatever and just throw them in there and then for dressing i would much like i prefer to use my own dressing than store bought because i feel like sometimes the store-bought it has a lot of like sugars or just like things added to it so i just stick to the basic salt pepper olive oil and then i'm gonna squeeze a lime in this one and then add white balsamic white balsamic is so good some salt and then this is the white balsamic that i use it's just it's a white balsamic vinegar my mom is here you didn't already see but she's gonna cut up the rotisserie chicken for me because it's really gross to cut it up with your bare hands okay here's what the beauty is looking like i'm just gonna get this just shred some pieces on top and i think the secret to a good salad is a well mixed salad i can't stand when i go to a restaurant and the dressing is all at the bottom and i have to you know like it just doesn't taste good it's good when it's all evenly distributed all even throughout i feel like such a mom okay here's the salad bon appetit also water i've drank already three or four of those yetis so i'm always drinking water and then after this i'm going to have my coffee   you want to watch me amount so around dinner time when i'm trying to get dinner started or finished or whatever um i have been letting her watch tv but i've been limiting it to five minutes and one thing that i feel like has really helped is setting a timer for five minutes on my phone and i let her set the timer would you like to come turn on the timer on my phone yeah okay nice okay i'll let you know when the time is up okay okay so now it is dinner time for dinner i try to make it as quick and simple as possible because it's the end of the day i'm tired kids are tired jordan's tired we're hungry we want to hurry up and do bath time and get elathia to bed at a good time um because it is summer we have been going out and getting ice cream some nights and just like having more fun so i feel like i've been making things that a little bit more simple than that simple so today we are going to be having some salmon burgers i love salmon burgers um alysia really likes them i get this one right here it's actually the kroger brand and then we are going to have some sweet potato fries with that too so this is very easy to do it's just honestly i'm not really cooking i'm just warming things up but um and days that i'm not doing something that's basically already made i will do a type of like either will have like a rice or potato some type of veggie and then a meat and i do remake quite a lot of our home chef meals we still do get home chef delivered pretty frequently um but the days that we like don't have home chef i will remake an older recipe i like keep all the recipe books and i use pinterest a lot so i will look up like what i have in the like fridge so like the other day i made stuffed peppers because i had peppers left over and i had some beef left over so i just pinched like beef and peppers and then a recipe came up so highly suggest you guys trying to use pinterest to kind of like help you with that um i really enjoy cooking it's like how i wind down i will always have like a glass of wine or a shandy with me so today i'm having just a little shandy um and i'm just gonna put this together and then we're gonna eat our dinner   here is our dinner yep twox is eating some and then anytime i make anything that like requires toppings and whatnot i love to put it on a cute little plate like this and put all the options and if you guys i feel like i've raved about this before but this honey mustard is so good they sell it at kroger i think they sell it at a couple of other places too but it's really good honey mustard but this is what we're gonna have for dinner tonight very simple and easy just throw on all the toppings and we've been eating outside and just enjoying the weather while we can i hope you guys enjoyed today's video i will leave links to my pinterest if you guys want to see like all the recipes that i frequently see and i'm pretty sure on my highlights on instagram i have a recipe or a yummy page saved of recipes that i've made before and if you guys want i can start actually linking and doing all my recipes that i do on instagram so just let me know it's gonna be good alright bye guys hey guys so the lord has put this video on my heart for like probably almost three weeks now and i have pushed it back and pushed it back and pushed it back the enemy has been so in my head telling me that i am under qualified that i am too scatterbrained to do this that i'm too sleep deprived to do this that nobody cares nobody wants to listen um god's word is irrelevant nowadays the enemy has put every single thing in my head that you could possibly think of as to why i shouldn't do this video and my really good friend esther came over the other day and she just encouraged me and the lord spoke through her and let me know that i needed to fast and that i needed to do kind of like a detox from social media and so i took off three days from being off of instagram which is what i frequently consume and i'm always producing and consuming on so i did that and i've just been spending a lot of time in the word i like broke it up into like three sections so the first day i spent time just in prayer and just like speaking with the lord having a conversation with him throughout the entire day the second day i spent time in podcasts and different sermons different preachers different things like that and then today i spent the day reading and spending time in his actual word so i actually did talk about my whole detox on my podcast that my husband and i have together which we are now launching season three so i will link that up here if you guys want to hear about that i go into full detail because during all of this my husband has been gone so we didn't even get a chance to really talk about this because during the week he's so busy with work and i'm so busy trying to keep two children alive that we don't really have time to like have a deep conversation so he heard it firsthand on the podcast and he was asking me questions and we recorded it so if you guys want to check that out i'll leave a link down below but basically just bear with me because i have so many things going on in my mind and so many things that the lord has really been revealing to me and i just it's just a lot so have some patience and grace with me on that part i will try my best to time stamp it to make it as cohesive as possible but just just letting you guys know i just really feel like the lord is just speaking through me so my heart has been very heavy for a lot of the kids that are being trafficked right now and human trafficking is so relevant in our world and i don't think people realized it until human trafficking day which was a couple of weeks ago i think it was last week or something and to me the fact that we even have that we even deal with that that just like really solidified to me how evil this world really is and this world is something i want nothing to be a part of this world is so evil and so wicked to the point where we have to tell people that raping children and taking children is not okay or there are there are people that are fighting that and saying that it's a preference or that that is a way of life or that people don't get to choose their preference to want to rape children does it make any sense to me it's something that i will never be able to wrap my mind around like why why do we automatically go and want to defend the rapist instead of defending the innocent child so that to me is just something that has really shaken me up and has been really heavy on my heart and a verse that really goes along with that is isaiah 5 20 and i have a couple of notes here because i want i don't want to be as scattered brain as my brain really is so i have a couple of notes but isaiah 5 20 says what sorrow for those that say that evil is good and good is evil that dark is light and light is dark that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter if this doesn't scream to you the world that we live in right now i don't know what will this is so true what sorrow for those that say evil is good and good is evil that is literally the best definition of our world right now what is wrong people believe is right and what is right people believe is wrong it's it's so evident in our culture right now it's so evident everywhere and don't make this political even though it somewhat could be political but that as well like all of it has to do with this that dark is light and light is dark that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter the bible is filled with verses like this it's filled with things that is just so true in our world right now our bible is not dead our bible is not an old cracked up history book that like is all dusty and okay like let's look in this every year now but this has nothing to do with what's going on because it's just so old that is not true at all the bible is the living word of god if you have a question you will find the answer to that question in the bible i guarantee it the bible is filled with everything that people went through back then that we are going through now saddam and gomorrah i swear we are living in sodom and gomorrah as well like it's disgusting but everything that is in the bible is so true and if we spent the amount of time that we spent bickering on facebook or bickering on social media with others about things we don't agree with them and if we spent that time in the world how much better do you think the world would be i listened to and you're gonna be shocked because i was shocked too but i was listening to logan paul's podcast and he had ben shapiro on his podcast which is probably the weirdest combination i've ever heard of in my entire life i've never listened to his podcast and when he had ben shapiro on i was like interesting so i wanted to listen to it slogan asked him what are the three most the three biggest obstacles that as americans we face ben's first answer was the inability to have conversation and that is so true it is so hard to talk to someone or to just communicate with someone because most of the time we go into a conversation with the intention of changing someone's mind or with the intention of like okay i'm not even gonna associate myself with this person because they don't think like me look like me so why would i want to have anything to do with him and that is such a toxic thing to think of and that's why cancel culture i feel like is so relevant right now which is also so toxic and cancer culture is the exact opposite of what jesus is jesus is grace jesus is love jesus is forgiving cancer culture is the complete opposite of that what the world is doing now is a complete opposite of what the bible has said so jesus is loving and graceful and forgiving and the world is saying uh you make one mistake done cancelled we're done with you forget you bye-bye that is the opposite of what the of what god does god is so gracious god is so loving and jordan said this on a podcast episode a while back and it is so true and i don't think a lot of people realize this but god knows every sin you have and will commit god does not live in time he is outside of time and it's really hard for us to wrap our minds around that and god is god that's the thing we try to think the way that god would think but we're not god we will never understand we will we can't fathom certain things so god is outside of time so think of time right here god is outside of that he sees the past future everything he sees everything so when you go to accept the lord or when you want to talk with the lord he already forgave you of the sins you haven't even committed yet he already knows what it is before you even do so to think that you can do something or will do something that will not have that you won't have god's grace is crazy because he's already forgiven you of that he already knew you were going to commit that but to him he still loves you and still wants you so that's something jordan said that forever go on it's always stuck with me and it's just so true and i don't think a lot of people think about it that way or even realize it that way but we live in a very fallen and wicked world and i was listening to a lot of john mcarthur and if you guys aren't familiar with him i highly suggest you listen to him he actually just did a three-part um sermon on justice and the final justice and he was just saying how corrupt the justice system is and it's just as corrupt as the criminals that are committing the crimes so it's just all over the place and to think that we will find justice in this world is kind of foolish because only god is perfectly righteous and perfectly just and we won't have that without the lord okay that was kind of like one thought that i had to finish off now kind of another thought of social media and the relevance of that in our lives right now so um we have a private facebook page for our podcast it's called ask for me my house on facebook and that page is so beautiful but it's also so hard to kind of run because we don't want to censor people and filter people i'm not about to be like mark so it's just really hard to navigate through that because people want to have conversations but like ben shapiro was saying it's hard to have a conversation with someone because we can't even fathom or if someone doesn't agree with us completely then we completely shut them out well you will never completely agree with someone the only person we should ever completely agree with is jesus in the bible that is the only thing sometimes like you would think like oh jordan i agree on anything no we don't there are certain things that jordan i don't agree with and i'm not talking about biblical things i'm talking about like stupid things like do you put your socks on first or do you like like something like that but there are certain things that you won't agree with someone with and that's okay i think that's a thing that our society cannot wrap our minds around if i were to like i mentioned john macarthur okay so right now john admittedly came out and said that do with the regulations because he's in florida so he even said that with the regulations and everything he is still going to open up his church regardless of what the government says for him to do now because i mentioned john did you automatically go and think because he said that i agree with what he's saying maybe a lot of people assume because you associate yourself with someone or because you are subscribed to someone or you follow someone then you agree with every single statement this person has ever said in their entire life and that's not true that's that will never be true but in the society we live in right now that's what people assume that okay if you associate yourself with this person you must agree with everything they've done here or the opposite if you don't then it's just it gets really messy and with tick-tock i've especially noticed our younger generation i see a lot of people putting a lot of their time and energy in social media and time and energy into things that don't matter the way our brains are slowly starting to get wired is we get a lot of pleasure from likes we get a lot of pleasure from interaction online we our brains are just starting to work in wire in a way that dopamine gets released when we get a notification on our phone which makes us want to be on our phone even more and makes us want to engage with this black hole right here and it's just very toxic and your worth doesn't come from you saying something on tic tac and getting the most amount of likes or saying something cruel to someone else and people agreeing with you it's just a very very toxic world that we're living in right now and a lot of people are getting further and further and further away from the truth which is their bible and the bible is not scary i i see why people get afraid and don't understand how to read their bible but just like you read a book or just like you do anything else you learn how to do it if you avoid it you're never going to learn how to do it but simply opening up your book and reading it and trying it then you'll learn it's not it's it's not as complicated as it may seem and i think that's the biggest thing people just get intimidated by not having their answers questions or having too many questions and again i think it's the circle because the church sometimes also is guilty of not answering those questions or avoiding them or if someone does ask the question then they shun them down and say well why would you ask such a foolish question well there's no such thing as a stupid question and i think like i was saying it just becomes a very like toxic circle of that but i just want to encourage you guys to read your bibles and a great place to start is in the book of james i really really like the book of james and it's just very relevant to our world right now um it's a very short book as well then after reading james maybe read through the book of ruth i actually did a free devotional on it and i tried to make the devotional as user-friendly as possible as simplified but also rich in information and rich in bringing the bible life to you because context is everything which is another issue that a lot of people run into is not fully understanding the context of bible but the more you read the bible the more you'll understand the context the bible is connected in every single which way god is just so funny he's comical he's a humorous god there are so many things that he has done in my life recently where i'm like dude you're funny that was funny for example jordan yesterday when we were recording the podcast he mentioned how a cow has three stomachs and that we are meant to digest the bible just as the cow digests his food and my friend esther had said the same thing three days before that jordan had no idea that she had said that so to me i'm like dude you're funny you wanted me to hear that didn't you you had two people tell me the same thing that means you really wanted me to hear that so the lord has just really been speaking to me in so many different ways and using my family and my friends and i want to encourage you guys to really surround yourself with a solid group of christians because the lord uses those people and if you're surrounding yourself with toxic things if you're surrounding yourself with toxic friends and that's not to say to completely isolate yourself from people who don't think like you because like i was saying i think that's a huge problem too but to not have any christian friends at all to not have that community at all can be extremely harmful to you so the lord spoke through my mom the other day i did an tv on it she shares the story but basically i was listening to very toxic music and the lord revealed to her that i needed to stop doing that and so if you guys want to hear more about the story i'll link the t ig tv story down below if you want to hear like my mom's perspective of it but the lord spoke through her the lord spoke through my friend esther telling me to do a three-day fast the lord has spoken through my sister to me with my three-day fast she was like you need to do something different you can't just fast and like not do anything so my sister was encouraging me in that aspect so there's so many different things and so many different ways that the lord has been speaking through my like people that i'm around all the time so it's extremely important to find that circle and i vented to you guys about this before that for the longest time i did not have a community at all right when i was out of high school and in college i was very lonely i decided to not hang out with any of my friends anymore i basically ghosted a lot of my friends that were toxic and in the meanwhile i didn't have any other friends so i was just in a very lonely spot but the lord taught me so much during that time and it's okay to be lonely sometimes it's okay to not have those toxic friends and so that was something i really dealt with but i would pray i prayed for so many years for the lord to bring me like a good solid friendship good fellowship and the lord did bring it to me it just it took a little bit but during that time i learned a lot as well so i just wanted to encourage you guys in that aspect of all of just surrounding yourself who who are you with what are you listening to what are you doing with your time all of these little things will add up good com bad what is it my mom the amount of times my mom told me this bible verse growing up i should know this like the back of my hand but bad company corrupts good character and that is so true if you are listening to toxic music like i was i'm going to be thinking those swear words throughout the day booty booty buddy here booty booty booty there swear word here swear word there that's like stuff i'm just subconsciously feeding into myself if you're watching pornography or if you are watching a toxic show or whatever it may be you are allowing these things into your mind and into your brain these spirits into your head and that is not good the spiritual war is going on right now and i've said this many times but world war three is a spiritual war we're not physically out there fighting and killing each other but it is a very strong spiritual war and i just want to encourage you guys to pray over your family every day pray over your kids every day pray over your house pray over your rooms pray over your spouse spend time in prayer and fight that because the enemy is trying and he is so deceiving oh is he good at deceiving man he will look so good is so crisp it's a little bit off from the word of god but that's okay that's okay he's so but he's charming he's so sweet that's deceiving the enemy is so deceiving and did you know that when lucifer was up in heaven with god he was in charge of praise and worship he knows music why do you think that the music industry is so toxic and so gross and so filled with sight satanic ritual it is um this is not a conspiracy uh trust me it is not a conspiracy watch some music videos of the artists that you love the most what is the symbolism behind the stuff that they're doing pay attention look at it through a different lens and it will be very obvious to see what they're actually worshiping or what they're actually doing so the enemy is trying to deceive everyone the enemy is in the church he is in the church right now full-blown but guess what he's cute he's charming he makes me feel good i feel nice and sweet that's deception he is deceiving us and he's doing a real good job at it real good job but that's what the enemy does so why again bringing it back why is it so important to spend that time in the word because you will have discernment the lord you will be reading something and the lord will bring something to your attention boom you'll be like huh yeah no something's off here something's not right no thanks spending that time and prayer the lord will reveal yourself in so many ways and the lord really does whisper to us and it's been really hard for me to hear his whispers with my toddler screaming and shouting all around all the time so this fast was really important to me because i was spending more time in prayer more time in his word more time just listening and listening to him he's always talking to us but are we listening to him are we willing to listen to him now this is the other thing sometimes he'll tell us something we don't want to hear and we'll kind of block that away i didn't really want to hear that the music i was listening to was bad because i liked it it was upbeat it got me going i got my workout in faster i felt more awake like i liked it the beat was good deception sometimes oh but watching this this show is harmless it's harmless it's but nothing's going on like they're not telling me to go kill people they're not it's harmless it's not that bad yes it is if it's not glorifying god and if it's not doing something to make you closer to the lord why would you want anything to do with it why would you waste your time and energy in that we don't need to do that there is enough going on in the world right there that we don't need to be fueling ourselves and feeling everything else that the enemy is already doing the enemy is working overtime he is over time over time he is getting he's good he's good at deception he's good at what he does if you can't tell but god is better god is just god reigns over oh so i hope this wasn't too scatterbrained maybe it was a lot of information i don't know this is like what i've been thinking about all day this is like what might if you wanted to get an idea of what my head the inside of my brain looks like that was just it it's kind of all over the place it's kind of like here and there but i just wanted to encourage you guys what are you listening to what are you watching who are you hanging out with um are you spending more time being a troll than you are over here i don't even know how to finish this off like have a good day hope you enjoyed it like i don't know but comment down below and let me know what really spoke to you what the lord really wanted you to hear from this what what was the thing that you were like oh that's what i'm struggling with or oh that's you know and this is not to cast judgment on people because i first hand am guilty of all of these things i am guilty of listening to the music i am guilty of watching shows that i should not be watching that are not good for me i had to stop watching how to get away with murder because i was like dude this i'm like why am i watching this like what is this this is not it's not a good show and i'll just say if you have to think is this a good show to watch it's probably not a good show to watch so i'll end it with that if there's something that's been on your heart also comment it down below and let's just have a conversation down there um and yeah we will continue this conversation on our podcast our podcast is very similar to how this video is we're just rapid fire truth seeking believers so if you guys want to check that out i will also link that down below now that we are back and doing season three so feels good to get that off my chest and thank you jesus thank you jesus okay my spiel is done i love you guys and i will see you in my next video bye good morning mr hey guys look who's home look who came home for the week whoa for the weekend i'm squat down to like get to my house jordan came home for the weekend yesterday we went to my parents house and they live on a lake so it's so nice to just sit out and bathe in the sun i didn't work out this morning i haven't worked out the past couple of days because when jordan's not here it's really hard to work out before the kids wake up because ari likes to wake up at six and then he likes to chat for a little bit so i like to talk to him and like interact with him but today we're going to be doing a two month update so i'm going to start doing monthly updates on ari and then i'll do like a postpartum update as well but um can you open this for me but we're just going to do a little vlog today i'm trying to drink my coffee right now before i get alesia up because she loves to drink coffee and if i'm drinking my coffee around her she keeps asking for my coffee so i would like to enjoy my coffee in peace puffy and she calls it coffee or it sounds like she's saying puppy or puppy puffy she can't say the f or the c     so to do your affirmation okay okay you can do your affirmations now i am left on the belt shirt do you wanna wear that shirt these shirts and pants tonight let's change ready one two three wow i cannot handle her guys i just can't you don't want to wear a bow today no bow okay thank you   alicia do you remember playing under this playback when you were already size i just put ari down for his nap but i'm gonna kind of make a little red noise here you guys really seem to enjoy when i do hauls so i thought i would do one today of a couple of things that i got from thredup and they are working on today's video with me and i do have a code where you guys can save 30 off of your stuff so i've worked with him many times before i'm a huge fan of thredup for both me and the kids which they do have kid stuff which i feel like some people don't even realize but but in case you guys didn't know thredup is the world's largest online thrift store which makes it so convenient because i love thrifting but i do not have the time to go and spend three to four hours at a thrift store and sift through things it's so much easier to do it on the app through the website where i can search through colors where i can search through companies where i can search through different colors that i like to wear different bathing suits that i'm looking for or tops or whatever it's just so much more convenient to just be able to search exactly what you want they have different brands that you normally shop at up to 90 off so i was specifically looking for more athleisure wear more comfy things this dress that i'm wearing right now is actually from there okay so this dress for example is from a company called lesticle and it had the tags on it and it was estimated to be 43 dollars and i got it for 20 so very cute and more than half off but look what i found i have been looking for leggings like this for months and i could never find them and i just felt screamed when i saw these they even still have the tag on them so the estimated retail price was 69 i got them for 25 and then the sports bra is also from there it's from reebok and the estimated was 70 and i got it for 14.99 and that's what the back looks like it's very cute like strappy but i love this outfit i also found this really cute like workout pullover sweater it's from fabletics it has like these cute little things on the side to like make it tighter but it still has a tag on it like full blown fabletics tag on it so the estimated price of this was 60 and i got it for 17.99 okay i also found this nike sweater that the estimated price was 60 and i got it for 25 so as you guys know i work out in my garage so it's gonna start getting pretty cold out but i love this it's from nike very pleased with the things that i was able to find so i will leave a link down below if you guys want to save 30 off your first purchase i cannot rave about thredup enough because i just think it's so convenient and smart and like you're saving so much money so i don't know why you wouldn't try it out so i will leave at that link down below ari is over there and i can hear him he's starting to get hungry so i think i'm gonna feed the little guy and then i will check back in with you guys and finally do a little postpartum situation all right guys i just found ari i'm going to start burping him but i thought i would do his two-month update so this is what he currently looks like wow yeah tell them tell them your name hey i'm already out tell you his eyes are still pretty blue and his hair is pretty light so i think he's gonna look a lot more like me everyone says he looks like me which makes me very happy because it's a little frustrating when you bird then breastfeed two babies and they look like their father it's not fair right or we tell them it's not fair it's not fair to my mommy so he had a little bit of cradle cap that has gone away a lot of his hair is coming in as you can see he's starting to hold his own head up we call him mr bobble because he literally is so determined to hold his own head up that he'll like throw himself over so when we hold him we have to really make sure we're holding on tight i can't believe i have another kid isn't that crazy like i have two kids now i have a little boy and a little girl that's wild so he is starting to be awake for a lot longer now i say his wake wake windows are probably 30 to 45 minutes long maybe even an hour sometimes it depends i try to stretch it out as much as i can to get him to do you see that to get him to really nap um but look he's so determined to hold his own head like i keep trying to put him on my chest but he does not want to stay so he's starting to notice a lot more things like right now he's really intrigued by the tripod of the camera he loves to look at fans he likes the mamaroo now because he'll like stare at those things he loves to be inside the play mat we have one from loverly or love every i can't remember how to pronounce it but um he really likes being in that thing as well he loves tummy time um he likes bath time as well the only thing we've noticed he does not like is to be hot so we have to avoid taking him outside dude we avoid taking him outside because he does break out i think he's just like jordan and he like is allergic to the heat or his sweat or something because his little cheeks will get little bumps on them so we try to keep him out of the heat as much as possible we'll just keep him inside um and i always make sure to like wipe off his face with like a washcloth after we go back inside he's currently wearing size one diapers which is so exciting because that means we're getting so big look at that you're getting so big look at all that long age he has a very very long torso and he's already wearing zero to three months clothes and he fits in three to six month clothes which alesia did not fit in until she was like nine months old like she stayed in zero to three clothes until she was like six months he was wearing a shirt yesterday that was a lathes that she didn't wear until she was five months old and he's two months old and he was already wearing that so he's already so much bigger than she was yeah i think that's it that's his little update i'll do my update in a second once i get him to go down for his nap so i don't have this little bubble bubbly head going around you want to go in your plane wow i'm gonna put him in this play man for a second you want to play okay little dude is chilling over there i'm going to start packing because we are going to go to new york to visit my family um and we are driving we're gonna drive through the night because just being in the car with lathia for that long just does not seem like a good idea so i am packing up their stuff ahead of time so i don't have to worry about it and that way i can like do all my laundry and whatnot so he goes through his clothes so quickly so i am just going to pack at least four outfits a day and we're only staying for three days so i need at least 12 little outfits so i'm going to do that i'm gonna bring birth cloths and then we are bringing the snow with us too because i'm not about to not sleep through the night okay i'm gonna pack put hari in his crib inside the snuggle me and then i put three little friends for him to have something to look at because he didn't really want to be in that plate mat so i'll put him here give him some his little friends if you guys have been here since i had a olathe i used to do this for latvia too and she used to really enjoy it so hopefully this will keep him happy okay mr ari does not want to be put down so bud is chilling with me i'm making us some lunch because i'm so hungry right now but i filmed a what i eat in a day last week so if you guys are curious about that i'll link it down below but usually for lunch i will have a yummy salad so i only have arugula right now so i'm gonna use like a handful we have some salmon left over i love salmon and salad if you haven't tried it before you definitely should because it just it tastes so good i like it kind of cold though so like i'm not going to warm up the salmon right now the smell of it is just so fishy i just literally just have like a chunk of it so i'm just going to kind of break it this is really gross and i can hear lathia right now she's just like talking but she's not supposed to be awake right now so ma'am can can have a chat she's not crying or anything but normally she's been doing that where she'll like wake up halfway between her nap and she'll like chat for a little bit and then she'll fall back to sleep so i'm praying she'll fall back to sleep because i would love to enjoy my salad with mr aries and ari has to eat so i try to like not feed him all the time around her because i don't want her to get frustrated that i'm like always feeding him even though i feel like i always am so i have a video that i'm posting it's already up by the time you guys see this but i'm having jordan just watch it to see what he thinks and kind of like filter through that anytime i do a video that's more intense i'll have someone like watch it before i post it intense what it is intense it's not your average like vlog of just like life oh i hear like you look at that head ah throw it this way aries i am about to upload that video and make you go live which i'm very nervous about um i actually haven't even made the thumbnail yet but one video idea i have that i've been kind of like going and thinking of like how to do it is how i make my youtube videos or like how like what the whole process looks like there's no right or wrong way to do youtube and i think that's the beauty of it so so many people do it in so many different ways i've always been so curious to see how other people do their youtube videos and how they figure everything out so let me know if you guys want to see like us from the very beginning to the very end of posting a video what that process and what that like time like timeline looks like and i would love to film that video for you guys but i'm posting this now i'm quickly going to make the thumbnail then i will update you guys on postpartum for me what my body looks like how i've been feeling and all that good stuff um today has just been like all over the place i feel like any time i'm about to travel especially with two kids and it was kind of like a last minute thing so i'm trying to like figure all this stuff out and tomorrow is my best friend's birthday it's alexia's best friend's birthday as well she has swim class tomorrow like there's so many like little things that are happening all at the same time but i'm trying to navigate through so i'm gonna make this thumbnail and then i'll be right back two months postpartum i'm gonna give you guys a quick little rundown so i had first degree tearing this time which was fabulous i had three three three i had maybe i had too much coffee today i had three degree tearing with allathia i had internal stitching i probably had anywhere between 10 to 15 different stitches and it was so painful but this time around i only had three stitches and they healed very quickly i think around three weeks they were already healed um jordan i did not wait the six weeks i'll tell you that um my doctor was fine with it just listen to your body i'm not encouraging to you to do that but i know my body well and with alathia when i went into my six week appointment she told me i could have sex already and i was like i am not ready yet we didn't have sex until four months postpartum with alethia and this time it was like three weeks or something so very different but you know your body best so mr ari is not napping today okay he's back there in the mamaroo bouncing around okay so as far as down there the healing was so much faster this time um as far as up here breastfeeding is going really well i feel like my milk is regulated now and with lathey i had a huge oversupply and as big as a blessing it is to produce a lot of milk oversupply becomes very hard to manage because you can't go more than an hour without pumping or breastfeeding you get very engorged you're more likely to get mystitis like there's so many things like there's many cons that come with that as well so this time around i really wanted to avoid doing that and the best way for me to do that was to not pump and so i have not used a mechanical pump the only pump i've used is the haka which i use every time i breastfeed and so my milk supply storage right now is insane i've had to give milk to my mom for her to put in her freezer because we're out of room we just bought a deep freezer that we're gonna store some of it to as well um i am hanging on to it because i don't know if my supply will drop again i already did get my period back i got it back seven weeks postpartum so a week ago um it came back really light so i'm not sure if that was like my real first period or if it was just like a short thing i don't know but um i wasn't sure if that would decrease my milk because with alathia it did so i kind of want to hang on to that milk for a little bit to see if my supply drops every time i get my period every month but we'll kind of see like size wise they're like back to normal and i can really tell how much they're sagging this time so because your breasts get so large and so small again and large and small in pregnancy like all the hormone changes and the size changing it's like so much easier for them to sag and i've definitely noticed that like as soon as he's done eating and they're not like as full as they normally are i'm like wow these like look like little flappy balloons but it's all worth it i don't mind it now i will show you my tummy so i am wearing a dress but i have one like little biker shorts on underneath okay so with the whole stretch mark situation i got some with the lathia but they ended up going away with ari i got them again but i got a little bit more than i did with alathia and they have slowly started to go away so i've done microneedling twice um and i don't really attribute that to them going away i feel like because they came so quick they kind of went away so quick too and i always put breast milk on them so i feel like breast milk really helps but this is what my tummy looks like i definitely just have like a lot of loose skin and just like you can tell the skin is a lot more stretched out than it once used to be i have been working out um as far as i don't know if like the skin is just gonna go away like i don't know how that works but i am not concerned about things like not going back to how they once used to be i always say like i don't want to go back to my normal body because this new body of mine was able to create two new humans that i love tremendously so um i know my body will never go back to the way it used to look but honestly i don't want it to i was so skinny like when jordan and i got married i was like 100 pounds and when i look at those pictures and videos of me now i'm like that was not healthy so i feel like i've like filled out more i look more like a healthy weight so i'm not mad at it at all i definitely do want to try to get into better shape though and just kind of like gain some more muscle and kind of lose a little bit of fat because i do have a little bit of fat here and there but that's normal so i am working on it he his farts when he farts it smells like a grown man has farted like they are ripe that is my two-month postpartum update ari's two-month little update if you guys enjoyed today's video i will also leave links down below to thread up if you guys want to try it out and get 30 off your first purchase and i will see you guys in my next video bye wow hey guys good night if it's a night time when you're watching this but it's night time when i'm recording this today i'm going to be doing a sleep with me night time through my night time sleep i think sleep with me doesn't sound that appropriate but i feel like it makes more sense sleep with us through the night video i loved watching these when i was pregnant because i wanted to really know what to expect like do you really not sleep through the night like how torturous is having a newborn in those first couple of months of the restless sleep like i was so curious about it so i thought i'd make this video to those of you who are pregnant or just curious or just don't have kids and just you know um excuse my eyebrows i don't know why they like look so bushy and like fluffy today um it's kind of distracting me so i hope it's not distracting you this has kind of just been our routine ari is two months and a week old so i feel like we've gotten it pretty down pat so if you guys are new here i do have a one and a half year old she's actually one and a half today and she is off and already in bed so i always take care of her first because she needs to go down earlier than ari's so because it's a summer time we've been a little bit more lenient with bedtime it's anywhere between eight to nine o'clock and so i do alathia first and then whenever she's done i start with ari so we do kind of have like a routine set up we did do the taking care of baby's uh newborn sleeping program so it is important to do kind of like a nighttime routine we don't bathe him every night but he does have a little bit of cradle cap so i'm going to kind of brush that through today um and do all of that so that's like mainly why he's thinking about today and he did spit up quite a bit and it gets like stuck under his neck and it smells like cheese so we're gonna get rid of that so right now i'm gonna undress him first thing that starts off our nighttime routine is bath and if it's not a bath then it's him changing into his pjs and one way that i like help him like unwind a little bit is when i'm changing him i do put lotion on him every day because his skin is pretty dry and i'll give him like a little baby massage like massage out his little fingers because i feel like baby's fists are always like clenched like that so i must have just little fingers his little toes just like his little body help him kind of wind down and relax as you can tell right now he's passed out he's not supposed to be sleeping right now i have a little baby that's what i took talk about okay so i have them inside this little thing it's great for babies alithea used this until she was like seven months old and then this is the soap uh the like body wash that we use for them the scent is sweet orange vanilla and it is the best smelling thing you will ever smell the fragrance actually does not bother his skin because it's pretty high because it's really delicate and i really really like that   i am a clean chunky monkey   okay so i like to put him in his bassinet before i go and take my shower and start my like nighttime routine so my husband right now is currently traveling for work so he's not here so i have no option other to put him to sleep before i do my stuff or else how the heck am i gonna do that so because he already showered and all of that i'm gonna put him in his bassinet and we do have the snoo but i will say yesterday he was up every single hour and this thing was good for nada this thing did not work at all last night like he was furious every time i put him in here like there are some days that it works really well and then some days that it doesn't so don't feel bad if you can't get it but if any of you are military or your husbands are military you do get a 30 off discount so we are renting this one our rental is gonna be due in a couple of days actually i should really look up how to return it but we are buying it but because we have our military discount we're able to get 30 off and they always have different sales and it's not sponsored they've never paid for me to talk about it or anything but i just know a lot of people would love to like sleep through the night so this bassinet basically rocks and puts your baby to sleep so i'm gonna put him in here um and hopefully it works tonight you know because i would like to sleep tonight okay so he's like upside down for you guys but i just laid him in and it comes already with a um swaddle and you're supposed to swaddle with their arms down but he does not like his arms being down so there is an option to have their arms out so i put his little arms through the hole and before we had the bassinet we would still swaddle him but we used this swaddle um where is it over here we used to use this swaddle right here it's called to love to love love to dream or something and it allows your baby to put their arms up so if your baby doesn't like swaddling with their arms down and they prefer them up there's this swaddle that is great as well so i'm gonna put his little arms through and as you can tell he's awake i do put him in here sleepy but awake and he's almost outgrown this swaddle sack because this is a size small but i put that there like that i do put him down with a binky and i do keep the clip and i clip it all the way down here so if it does fall it falls off to the side and does not get around his neck so i'm gonna turn the machine on   so   uh   yes melanie mom and i were at a gas station no we are at panera and texas sun came on all right i'm getting my stuff ready for the night so i do breastfeed ari so i have a couple of things that i like to have with me at night so first is my haka i use this every single time i breastfeed and then in addition to that in my my little drawer which i will show you guys in a second i will have little nursing bags um or what what are these called milk bags for like they're specifically made for best milk so open one of these suckers up now what i do in the middle of the night and don't follow my advice just because i said it don't follow an influencer's advice always talk to your doctor but i've asked my doctor about this and she said it's okay to mix breast milk that's coming out of me onto another bag that already has breast milk so what i'll do is after i feed him i'll pour the milk in here and then throughout the night i will pour it all into here so she has told me that if it's the same room temperature it's fine so that's just like what i've gone based off of if you've heard otherwise or if you're not comfortable with that then you can like put it in the fridge at night but i personally am not i am not about to get out of my bed in the middle of the night five times like it's just i just can't so there's that i have my big ol yeti i used to in the very first month i used to have two of these with me at night right now i currently just have one and then i do like to have a snack i sometimes do get really hungry in the middle of the night so i'll bring the snack i don't have one right now i'll go grab one and then nursing pillow i love this one from snuggle me it's from snuggle me organics you guys probably know them for their loungers and they just came out with nursing pillows these are so much better so much better than the papi because it's really skinny right here and you can easily snug it under your arm like this and i slant it like that so if he's on this side i slant it like that so his body goes downwards because he still kind of struggles with acid reflux so it's good to feed on an incline like that and it's just so much more comfortable i really really love this so definitely suggest this and then for me and my attire i do not wear a shirt to bed i only have this flannel on because it's a little chilly but i do not wear a shirt to bed it is just useless it's just pointless you end up taking it off anyway so i always like sleeping with the nursing bra on i have this one on right here that is from amazon i love it i have it in tons of different colors very comfortable very supportive you just pull it down on either side um one thing i have and use a lot are these nursing pads if you leak a lot at night like i do you don't want to be stopping wet and all you know it's just not an uncomfortable it's a very uncomfortable feeling so i have these i will link them down below these are my favorite i've tried multiple these are reusable and i believe it's bamboo but i love the size it's very large i have yet to fully go through one of these with alathia i used to put um diapers in my bra because that's how much i would leak so if you leak a lot i highly suggest the diapers because those will work really well get like newborn diapers and just put them in your bra um so you're not like sleeping and being all wet and that's like not a good feeling so that is that now i'm going to show you guys my little stash that i have down here of things that i keep for ari during the night so i don't have to get up my nightstand is pretty large so on the very bottom drawer it's pretty deep i have everything that i need for ari so i actually have a couple of swaddles here that would go in there um i have a bag of my nursing breast milk storage bags so i don't even have to go downstairs i have a thing right here filled with them i have some burp cloths a couple of those i have wipes i have diapers i have more birth cloths i have cream lotion everything that i will need for him throughout the night and that's basically it so my husband normally is on group duty and would normally burp ari if he was here but he's not so i'm having to wake up to breastfeed and burp him so you guys will see um throughout the night but depending on how many times he wakes up it gets really hard to stay awake during those nursing sessions so i do put on a show or go on instagram or like do something to keep myself awake because if you've ever like woken up with a baby at night you know how easy it is to like fall asleep and that can be really dangerous so i always like to give myself something to do while i'm nursing him and then when i burp him i actually get up and walk around to nurse him or i'll go downstairs or to bro i'll go downstairs i'll get a snack i'll like refill my water i'll kind of like move my body a little bit so i don't fall asleep and then i put him right back down so you guys will see that but right now what time is it it is 9 49 so um depending on how my boobs start to feel if they start to feel like they're getting a little bit big i will take him out and i will dream feed him i don't do that that often i feel like it just kind of depends but um yeah i might do that i might not we'll see because he ate last around 8 30 8 45 which is about an hour ago so i do like to like feed him right before he goes to bed before i put him in there but he took his bath and whatnot so we'll see hopefully he'll last until probably 3 a.m i don't know i'm not going to say what time i think he'll wake up because he just wakes up whenever he wants so we'll stay tuned for that but i'm going to gucci in my bed get myself ready and then i'll see you guys whenever ari wakes up hmm good night   hmm     foreign ugh um   um uh hmm wow nice you're just smiling   did you sleep well yeah hi guys good morning so ari is wide awake for the day right now so he woke up a little bit before seven because my alarm went off well i was in the middle of feeding him and then he'll normally be up for about 30 minutes to 45 minutes and then he'll get down for his first step of the day so i always make sure to feed him first thing in the morning because then that way i don't have to worry about feeding him while i'm taking care of lazy or wearing my workout or like those first like couple of hours of the day so i probably won't have to feed him for another three hours which will be nice um but that was our night so he technically only woke up once and then again at seven but that was more so for the day i will put his log right here that the snow like records there may have been a couple of times where he fussed during the night but the snooze like started to rock him and he fell right back asleep he's a newborn there's some days where we have really good nights where he'll only wake up once or twice and then we'll have really bad nights where he'll be up every 38 to 45 minutes and just like won't go into a deep sleep so now that he is a little bit older though i'd say the first month it was consistent of him waking up every hour but now that he's a little bit older it's been more consistent with only waking up twice or sometimes once during the night um he has yet to sleep through the night still he still wakes up to feed which is fine i don't mind it and it feels great for me because if you know if you've ever breastfed before the longer you go the fuller the fuller your breasts get and it gets very painful and uncomfortable and so if you start sleeping through the night that's what i'm gonna have to deal with so don't want that um i have my milk where's i have my milk over there somewhere um and so since i fed him at three and right now at seven the milk was only out for four hours and you can have milk up anywhere between six to eight hours so first thing when i wake up i'll normally just in the fridge so it doesn't go bad and i actually normally will throw that right into the freezer because it ends up being six ounces which is what i think fills up the entire thing so i just throw that right into the freezer and freeze it for whenever so i hope you guys enjoyed this video i'm gonna chat with ari now talk with him a little bit i try my best to really like expand those wake hours by entertaining him and playing with him and doing things like his little brain going so i hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe down below so you don't miss out on any other baby video or faith videos beauty video all types of different content i love you guys so much bye hey guys welcome back to my channel today i'm doing my first parenting video i guess is what we shall call this so there's a couple of things that i slowly started to realize that i do that is not very traditional or typical of what most parents do and it wasn't until i was around people that are older than me or other moms that i started to realize they do certain things i'm like oh i don't do that not saying that what they do is bad or that i don't do it is bad it's just different so i thought i would share this with you guys today i try to be very intentional about what i do or don't do with alathia so i do put a lot of thought and effort and research and i look into different studies to kind of figure out how to navigate through this it's my first time being a parent it's a laziest first time being a kid so we're both new at this we're both learning so i try to give myself grace and i try to give olathe a lot of grace too which is why i think the whole parent relationship is just such a great representation of christ and it's just everything's connected didn't mean to like make this all into something that it's not but i have a list here of things i want to share with you guys that i don't subscribe to that i don't really do with alathia and kind of explain the reason behind it and maybe some of you do the same thing or maybe some of you are like completely against this either way i just thought it'd be an interesting video to do i do follow more so montessori stuff so my major was in early childhood education so i did learn a lot of this stuff in school and i feel like that's where i started to really like question things and like see why teachers and professors would do certain things and then i did work at a preschool center and i learned a lot in that classroom a lot of what the teachers did and i saw how effective it was so i've kind of like brought that into my parenting style and i also follow a couple of accounts on instagram and this is a great thing about being a parent in 2020 is that there are so many resources out there and we can learn really well from other people and i've like taken that to the extreme like i really try my best to learn from other people's mistakes so i don't have to do those mistakes so i follow a couple accounts that i will link down below one is big little feelings and this account has like completely changed my parenting way and like just the way i talk to alathia um another one that i follow is the hippa family she is like a montessori mom and she does a lot of stuff she has a whole like series on discipline and teaching your kids so also link that down below um i love following taking care of babies there's a couple of other accounts too i feel like they all kind of like intertwine into each other so if you're wondering where i'm getting all this stuff from that's probably those accounts so if any of you are mamas i highly suggest you follow big little feelings because it's just been so helpful so let's just get on into the video though first thing i don't subscribe to is doing everything for your child i will do the basic things that she's unable to do for herself for example she can't change her own diaper i have to do that for her she can't bath herself or bathe herself i have to do that for her but things such as grabbing a cup grabbing a snack going up and down the stairs sitting on the toilet like other secondary things that normally people would help their kids with i don't do that for her i really love how independent she's become and is because of that and she like thrives i feel like she's so confident in herself she's very independent a couple days ago we were sitting on our patio i was on the sofa and she wanted to go up the stairs so she had two things in her hands she had a cup and a bowl and she wanted to go up the stairs now she doesn't go up the stairs on her hands and knees anymore she actually walks and steps um so she was doing that and she was bringing the items up with her i could have easily ran over there and did it for her put all the cups and bowls at the top of the stairs for her yada yada but i didn't i just kind of sat back and you could literally see how her brain was processing and thinking through how to get everything up so she was holding onto the rail would put one leg up bring one item up and then turn back around pick it up and bring it up like she figured out on her own and it was so encouraging for me to see that because one i know she could do it but two now she knows that she could have done it and it's so good for her little brain to figure out how to do that on her own had i interrupted that had i been there and did it for her she wouldn't have been able to know she could do it she would have missed out on that learning experience of problem solving on her own and just overall i feel like the biggest thing is problem solving she's able to problem solve by herself and i'm not interjecting or i'm not not allowing her to do that next thing that i do that i never thought i would is that i don't subscribe or i don't get upset at messes i let alexia get as messy as she pleases and this was something like i said i'm like a clean neat freak you would never think that i would let her play with paint play with yogurt play with her food throw her food but i do i really don't think it's a big deal i love sensory play it's so good for kids to do sensory play but it's really easy for us to not want them to do that because we don't want to deal with the mess but i've made a corner and i've put a thing outside i make sure that the environment is okay to get messy i try my best to like lay it on a mat or put a bib on her smock and like use things that won't stain so that way she can still play and explore sensory play is so good for their mind so i let her get as messy as she wants i don't interject when she's playing i don't like make a big deal if paint gets on the wall because paint it can be repainted we can get it out with fabric cleaner like little things like that i'm not going to get upset about because it's just a materialistic thing and i don't want her to think the materialistic thing is more important than her learning and her education so i just don't make a big deal about it it's very easy to clean up after the fact when she goes down for her nap it takes a couple of minutes and it's not a big deal so i don't freak out over messes as well as spills i know it can be really easy to get upset over them when they spill things but i'd say 9 out of 10 times when they spill something it's on accident so this is something that big little feelings taught me um if they spill something instead of saying like oh no like you spilled the milk to say oh no there's milk on the counter let's clean it up together that way you take the pressure off of the kid making a mistake because it wasn't intentional and you kind of focus more so on cleaning up together so i've started to do that and i really feel like it's changed because it doesn't make her feel guilty and ashamed in herself for something that she didn't mean to do next one probably will be more controversial but i do not say no to lathya now not to say that i don't say no overall to her not doing things i specifically don't use the word no and the biggest reason for that is because it seems very uneffective what i try to do instead of using the word no is i try to explain things so she's trying to reach into a cabinet that has chemicals in it instead of just simply saying olathe no what i'll say is alathia there are chemicals in there that are harmful to us we're not going to play with those right now we're going to play with this instead that way she gets an explanation and then she kind of just she's kind of like okay whatever mom forget it and then there's move that but if i say no there's something about that word that just makes them go huh and then they want to get it i swear whenever you say no either they repeat it 150 times or they just like rebel and just want to purposely do it because you said no but if i explain to her and she understands the reason for it that i'm not just saying no just because i'm the mom and i want to say no she sees that there's a reason for it and then she forgets about it and goes somewhere else so i feel like this has helped me avoid so many temper transforms so many like fights and back and forth that it's just made it a lot easier so i try to rephrase things and reword things in a way that i don't have to use the word no i just explain and further detail why i'm not allowing her to use that or now allowing her to do this or whatnot okay next thing is i don't change my mind if i set a boundary or if i set a rule i stick to it and i learn very early on that i have to do that because the second i go back on my word she takes advantage of that and she will try to push that boundary every single time so i've really learned that if i say something i really need to stick with it because i want to teach her that if you say something you stick with it but also i don't want her to feel like she can push me to my limit every single time and i'll change my mind so if i say we have five more minutes left of the tv show we have five more minutes left and that's that um it's really that simple okay next thing that might be a little bit controversial is that i don't baby proof and i got this one more from doing montessori i believe the hippa family did a video on this and that's where i kind of got thinking like oh i like that so it's basically you want to limit your nose because the more they can do the more the curiosity will be taken out of something but basically you want to stop setting limits and stop making them feel like they can't do anything because then they're going to want to do it so like it's just how it works like when someone tells you you can't do something you want to do it even more because they said you can't so i tried to limit the house and make the house full of yeses and any of the no's and the big things that she can't touch i don't leave available to her so i haven't baby-proofed anything the only baby-proofing we did do was we put railing on the top of the stairs so she couldn't fall down the stairs but we've since removed that since she can go up and down on her own i never put any locks on anything i never did any of that and she knows which cabinets she can't go into and she knows that she can go into the other ones so along with not allowing her to play with certain things i do allow her to play with other things so she can play with basically all the cabinets etc for two of them so she always plays with my tupperware my pots and pans my spoons all of that i always allow her to play with and that's just been another thing is like i freely let her explore those things kids really learn well when exploring not necessarily playing and confined to like a reading nook or a library or a classroom they learn through playing and exposure in different things so one way i'm able to cook dinner is by letting her play with my tupperware letting her play with certain things so anything that is super toxic to her that can potentially hurt her isn't even in reach anyway so the only thing i do have under the sink is like detergent pods and like sponges and stuff so even if she does get in there there's nothing that will potentially hurt her anyway all right next thing is i don't baby her and this is something that i used to do until she was probably 13 months but then after that i stopped so i would always do the baby voice and all of that but then as i started to realize that she could really understand me i stopped doing that and i just really don't baby her anymore i talk to her in conversation like i'll have set like in full sentences i have eye contact with her i get on her level i explain things to her i just treat her like a mini adult i mean she is a human of course and i treat her with respect just like i would like to be treated as well so i really try my best to like put myself in their shoes and think of like what used to frustrate me as a baby or when i was younger i don't know if you guys even remember some things but for me i vividly remember always like not liking being a kid because i couldn't do things that adult could do so i always tried to like allow alysia to do things and let her know that like being a kid is fun and that being an adult isn't gonna like solve all your problems if that makes sense so i always just like put myself in her shoes in her perspective and try to think like how i would have liked to be treated when i was her age okay if you take anything away from this video this is probably what i would want it to be and that is to not dumb down on your kids and i learned this probably about a month ago we were outside on the patio and i was leaf blowing and alecia liked the leaf blowers like her first time seeing it and she like thought it was fun and i was done playing with it and then she kept going over to it and pointing to it and i was like oh let me think of a word to replace leaf blower with because leaf blower she won't know how to say that she won't understand it so i was like trying to think of a word to like replace it with but then i was like no i don't need to do that i'm just going to call it what it is like this is a leaf blower and it blows the leaves and i called it that and then now she says leaf blower she like picked it up right away so after that i was like i really don't need to dumb things down or like not explain things because i don't think she'll understand it she will understand it so i say things as it is i call things what they are i don't like make up words to like replace certain things um even body parts and this might be controversial but the other day she like noticed body parts and i told her what they were called and she said them and she repeated them and that's that i feel like when we name certain things another word when they hear the actual word it's like oh she said this or who she said that but it's like that's a body part i don't know why it has to be a big deal which is i think a cultural thing of like that's like a whole nother spiel of that but um i just told her what it was so that might be controversial i'm not saying you have to do that for your kid but that's just kind of like my reasoning behind that just call it what it is and the last thing is i don't make her share and this is something from montessori we used to do this at the center i used to work at and it worked very well so basically if a child is playing with a toy they can play with that toy as long as they want to and need to play with it if another kid comes along and they want to play with it they need to wait until that child is fully done playing with it then they can play with it so um i really like that i never understood sharing because it doesn't make that much sense to me like if someone is playing with a toy peacefully and contently and another kid comes along why do they have to give that to them that doesn't i don't really think that makes any sense now i'm not saying that ari and alathia aren't gonna share their toys at all like i'm gonna have to buy another set of toys for ari whatever toys they do have they will share but if ari is specifically playing with a toy i'm not going to make him stop to take turns or give it to olathe because she wants to play with it so in the classroom this worked really really well there were no fighting over things i noticed a lot of kids wouldn't get upset and people and the kids were very selective of the toys they would play with in that instant so that also goes along with just like montessori in general when you're playing and doing a task and a toy you're doing it multiple times and just getting used to it so if another kid comes along and wants to do that that kind of like takes away from the learning experience of that child so i think that's like kind of all connected um but it's worked really well and she because of covid like we really haven't had the experience to do that just yet she only has one friend ellie that comes over and her mom also aligns with my non-sharing rule so we haven't like run into a conflict at all yet i don't know like what i would say to another parent if we're like out and about and they want to share and i'm gonna tell them like no we don't share like i don't know it like sounds kind of weird at first and not to say that i'm not gonna share with you but i feel like once you explain it it makes more sense so that's that if any of you do the no sharing rule let me know have you like told other parents that or how you go about doing that to other parents or like other kids because it can sound a little bit weird but yeah let me know what you guys do if you do that but i will link those resources down below i hope this video is helpful and insightful let me know any things that you guys don't do that's like non-traditional of what parents normally do i actually just got this book in from amazon it just came in the mail today it's called gentle discipline using emotional connection not punishment to raise confident and capable kids i haven't read it though but i have heard really good things about it so let you guys know um what i think about it and what i take away from it because i'm trying really hard to like buy different books and different resources and things i was trying to find like a christian book but i wasn't really seeing anything so if you guys have anything that is christian that aligns with discipline and parenting let me know or any other gentle parenting books that you guys might recommend um but that is all for today's video i hope you guys enjoyed it i love you and i will see you my next one bye that's a turtle   he burped on you you burped in your mouth yo   good morning guys welcome back to today's vlog this morning has been a little bit like off because it was raining yes um it was raining this morning and it was like really gloomy and dark and like i've said i have not been working out in the mornings i haven't been waking up before the kids so when i wake up i'm like what i'm like starting the day like with alysia we had our groceries delivered this morning so i thought i'd do a quick little haul of some things that we got so the weeks that we have home chef delivered i do like a lighter load of groceries because obviously we don't need that much if we already have our meals so mainly what i got was like stuff for like snacks and lunch and whatnot so here's kind of what an overview um i got a couple of veggies so tomatoes cucumbers and some peppers i got tons of tomatoes because i just cook a lot with tomatoes and i love making like little cold salads with tomatoes and red onion um three things of eggs because we just go through eggs so quickly i got a salmon we have some sausage left over and then this is our meat from our home chef meal um some pears this is like all of our salad stuff so i normally get arugula and a spring mix and then some yogurt fellatia i got us some strawberries and grapes that i've already washed and then here are our home chef meal we made one yesterday and then i stocked up on my creamer which is my favorite this is what alathia drinks um this milk is still from jordan this isn't like new stuff and then i also got some coconut water more of my coffee and then i have this little snack area that i've recently made for alexia i just put like little um sorry it's blurry little squeezies some these are so good fruit snacks but i keep them in the freezer or in the fridge because it's so much better cold and then i also keep these for her she really likes these it's just like a little thing and then some salami and that's basically everything that i've got it's nothing really crazy but i want to cut alathia's bangs because it's like starting to get into her eyes i did cut them back probably almost two months ago i think i cut them before ari was even born and i cut them too short they were like up to here on her it was so hard to do it's really hard to cut a toddler's bang and i'm not going to go and like get it done at the hair salon because i feel like it's just so easy for me to do it but i just have to get her to sit still so um i don't have any scissors that are like specifically for cutting i'm going to use like kitchen scissors and i'm just going to get her hair wet and hopefully that works out um oh yesterday i asked you guys on instagram about my hair because it was starting to get a little bit orange um as you guys know i put more blonde in my hair and i've been trying really hard to like keep the color and not get it all orangey because i'm naturally not blonde and my hair does pull orange um i use oplex i do use the purple shampoo the one from function of beauty but what i was doing wrong is i mean i like normally just use a shampoo but a lot of you said to put the shampoo a lot of you said to put the shampoo in my hair when it's dry and leave it on like a mask which i've never done so i did that last night yes happy bears okay you want gummy bears so i tried that last night i left it on for like way too long because i put it in my hair and then i threw it up in a bun and then i showered both the kids i fed ari i was like busy doing stuff and then when i realized i was like holy crap it's been too long and i want my hair to get purple so it is pretty icy and i'm like actually very impressed with how it looks again i just used my normal function beauty shampoo but it's purple like a dark lavender purpley color but i'm very happy with how it looks and then a lot of you recommended these other ones from amazon i can't remember what they are but i'll put a screenshot of like what you guys all recommended everyone basically said to get purple shampoo and then leave it on like a mask because that will help with like coloring it i do have a toning appointment in a couple of weeks but i don't want to wait that long so that's that let's cut tookies bangs your hair wet it works see how long it is i'm gonna cut your bangs okay just this part this part will keep long on the sides okay stand still oh i will refresh the weary and satisfies the thing let me cut a little bit more okay a little bit more so it's not in your   eyes whoa let me see let me see no there we go wait it actually looks really cute wait i did so much better this time last time she looked like lord farquaad   can i see your hair oh bubba yeah let me see okay i think it looks pretty good last time i made the mistake of cutting the sides too short so i made sure to leave that a little bit longer and just mainly cut like the middle oh it looks so much better and now it's not in her eyes because before every time she'd wake up in the morning i'd have to always put a bow in her hair or like clip it up because it would be in her face so i love your hair tubes oh good your momma you want to go gucci mama okay we'll go gucci mama yeah okay so gucci is the word that jordan's mom made up when she was a little girl it basically just means to cuddle and alathia knows that word now and she always says that she wants to guji mummaine right before she goes down for her nap i want to go gucci for mine yeah i'll go with your mama okay look at you goody on my mic greasy hug   i've been eating up my breakfast and then like two hours later i feel like i'm so hungry and then i go and eat my lunch mr ari just had his lunch so he's all good and content um last night i made home chef so i'm just warming that up right now it was probably the best home chef i've ever made and they are sponsoring this portion of today's video we have used home chef for so many years now and we get it basically every other week and it makes my life so easy i've gotten literally everyone in my family converted to ordering home chef too my mom is obsessed with it my sister is obsessed with it when she goes back to school she's going to start ordering them they also sell them at kroger so that's how my mom gets it she just picks it up when she goes to the grocery store i'm going to show you what the meals look like so it comes in a package like this with everything that you need portioned out you get the four person portion so it's enough for our family and then even more leftovers like i could probably feed two more people today with the leftovers that we have of yesterday let me grab the card to show you what i had yesterday because it was just glorious they're also running a labor day sale right now where you guys can get 80 off which is a huge savings so if you want to take advantage of that definitely do so this week but this is what i had last night which i'm about to reheat right now but the cards come like this it makes it super easy to follow through a lot of their meals require just one pot one pan um they also have oven ready ones which are fabulous we got only oven ready ones when sir was born because all we'd have to do is just throw everything in the oven together not have to do anything um they also have 15 minute meals they have salads they have so many different options so i will leave my link down below if you guys would like to get 80 off your first purchase they're having their labor labor day sale and i'm going to warm this up real quick i have alathia ate olive broccoli that came with it because it was a broccoli and chicken but she loves broccoli now and then look at all this rice that we have left over so i'm gonna warm this up right now i'm gonna make this in two days   so   all right y'all let's have a chat i'm sleepy i feel like the newborn thing is like definitely starting to catch up to me ari did not nap at all yesterday i don't know what was wrong any time i sat him down he would start like freaking out and screaming um it's just been a lot i know that sometimes on social media things can seem like it's really fun and games and easy but it's not and i want to be honest with you guys so i have been struggling i'm not sleeping i know in my video that i did of like a sleep with me he only woke up once but that was like such a rare occasion i got annoyed that night because i was like oh people are gonna think he only wakes up once but he did just that day but then the next day he woke up six times and then the next day he woke up two times like it's never that consistent so yeah things have been a little bit rough but i've just been drinking coffee drinking my energizers and just trying to get through it at night though at the end of the day i've been trying not to like just sit on my phone because i'm guilty of doing that i've been reading instead i got a gentle parenting book and i've been reading that i actually already finished it um but it was a good book so i'll link that down below for you guys but i got this big thing right here of cornstarch for alathia it's three and a half pounds of cornstarch i used to play with cornstarch and water all the time when i was a kid it's just like really easy to make and do and the cleanup isn't that messy so i had some the other day but the amount of corn starch that i needed to fill up her tub was a lot and i didn't have that so i was like let me just get this it's like 10 bucks on amazon so hopefully this will last us through the rest of the summer but i'm gonna play with her later today i've been trying to like think of like one activity a day whether it's like sensory or like something to like do with her so i spend more time with her because i feel like mom guilt is starting to kick in and i spend a lot of time with ari i'm always breastfeeding him i'm always holding him carrying him just with him he's a newborn he requires a lot of attention so i try to like plan out one little activity that i get to do with her that is fun for her that she'll like but also where i can just like devote my time with her oh another thing i want to share with you guys so at night when she's been going to bed i know you're not supposed to like have your kid watch tv right before they go to bed but who cares um i did one thing at night that i've been doing is because she wants to guji like i was showing you guys early she always wants to snuggle and cuddle um what we've been doing is i'll put ari to sleep and then i'll normally take a shower with her like i said jordan's not here so i've been having to like do a lot of stuff like with her so i shower i've been showering with her i sorry ari as well or get him into bed feed him and then get him situated and then we smell a little in my bed and then we do this bible for kids the bible app created this one but it's for kids and it's so cute it's like basically just like different books of the bible all the way through um we're pretty much not halfway but like we're almost there we've been doing quite a few so you like download the little story like that and then you read it and then it like reads it to you out loud and it has like a little picture there of like what's going on and it's like you can click on certain things and they'll like make noises and then you just like flip through i feel like i'm learning so much because it's just like rid it's like it's a little bit more simplified and it makes so much sense and i'm like remembering stories of the bible that i kind of forgot about so i love this for kids but also like for adults so i'll leave a like link to the app store where you guys can check that out um but i have a couple of like work things to do right now that i'm just going to get out of the way like just like mundane things that nobody really likes to do like emails and the boring side of work so i'm going to do that real   quick all right guys i wanted to share something that has been heavy on mine and jordan's heart no trigger warnings or anything um but jordan i have such a passion for kids in poverty specifically in tanzania and jordan i just did an episode on our podcast where we talk about this more into detail any kids in third world countries right now are going through so much ever since covet started and i mean there's not one person that covid hasn't impacted negatively um and i can't even imagine in a third world country so so we sorry um we sponsor i don't know what's wrong with my tripod lately but jordan and i sponsor um some kids through compassion if you guys aren't familiar with compassion i'll leave their link down below again we're not endorsed by them or anything like that we just genuinely really love what they do and they share the gospel to kids as well so we had a phone call with them probably two months ago aria was only a couple weeks old and we were asking them how we could possibly help with any everything that's going on in tanzania um in relation to coven 19 and they sent us over this flyer saying that they need 1.1 million dollars to basically help with everything they have i'll show you guys like a pamphlet of like what they basically need and in the podcast that i'm talking about we fully go into detail i just wanted to mention on here because the more people know the better we basically want to raise that 1.1 million dollars and it may seem like such a big number and it is but um jordan i did the math if people who just listened to our podcast if those people donated 22 dollars we would be able to reach that and the audience that we reach on our podcast is like not even half of what i reach on youtube so i wanted to share that on here for you guys and just encourage you guys just pray about it see if the lord puts it in your heart it's just a one-time donation which i think is really neat because normally with compassion you sponsor a child and that's like a monthly fee that you pay but this is just something that you just donate once and it will forever change at someone's life especially during these crucial times so i will leave that podcast down below if you want more of like a further explanation of it i don't have like all the information with me right now um but we have a link where you can directly do it through compassion it's not going to go any of it through us we're not doing any of that it just directly goes to them so i'll have that link down below if you guys want to donate or if you guys want to write letters to children who just need someone to talk to you can also do that and draw from them and send them scripture and just let them know that you're praying for them um so i will link all of that down below and then all the ads from our podcast are going towards that donation as well and i want to send all of my ad revenue from this video in the month of this this month what month is this so we're all in this together and doing this together but i'm going to leave all those links down below as well and my home chef link to you guys too but that is going to be all for today's video i love you guys so much and i will see my next video bye all right hey guys welcome back today's video is going to be more of a lighthearted fun video um i recently thought it would be really fun to get alethia a little playhouse but you guys know me i'm a big creative person i like to do creative things it's very therapeutic to me and i was like you know what we should make this look really cute so today's video is going to basically be that i'm going to be diying and making her playhouse more realistic more like my house basically and i'm very excited don't make this more than it is i feel like some people get annoyed when i like make things not colorful but honestly it's not that big of a deal i'm just having fun being creative alecia has loved it so far she's seen it multiple times and she thought it was so fun and cute so it's very cute without having doing anything to it i think it's very nice structure very good shape like i'm looking at it right now i love it it's very pretty the only thing that is bothering me is the wood it doesn't seem like it's that durable and i don't think it has a finish on it and if i'm gonna put a finish on it might as well paint it because i feel like it's just that much work so let me show you guys what i plan on doing with it um as well as some things that i've collected around my house to decorate it i'm trying to spend at least amount of money as possible i mean i had to pay for the actual playhouse but i found it on facebook market and i have been obsessed with facebook market recently i've been finding really good things for kids on there um i found a sandbox for her on there i found this on there um and they've been having really nice things so i'm just gonna share with you guys my overall plan with it so first i'm going to paint the entire thing white and i got alabaster from sherlom sher sherwin williams i don't know why i always have a really hard time saying that but i got alabaster so it's like an off whitish color and i'm basically going to paint the entire thing that color because it's also going to finish it i got the coating that's like used for houses and the exterior of homes so hopefully that will like last us a long time and then my accent color is like a creamish beige color are we surprised no um and that is what i'm going to use to paint like any extra things so the door i want to paint that color the mailbox the little bench and then the little fire uh what's it barbecue that came with it so that's that um i hope it doesn't take too long to paint it and then i'm also going to paint the inside of it to just brighten it up and make it also last a little bit longer as well um but let me just show you guys a quick little let me do a quick little haul of things that i want to use for it so i'll show you the things that i bought for it that i didn't have at hand that i thought would be really cute to have and then i'll show you guys the little shopping that i did around my house so first i got little numbers to put in front of the house which i think would look really cute just makes it look more like a house um i also got these two little picture frames from ikea i'm gonna put one picture of her and her best friend and then a picture of her and ari to put in there as well and then i got little fruits from ikea they come they're like little um they're like fabric ones so i got that as well and then last thing i bought are command hooks too so to hang up the picture frames and then to hang up a couple of like other miscellaneous items that i found so the inside of it i want it to be more simple because it's pretty small on the inside there's not that much room um so i kind of wanted to make like a little kitchen area for her to put little fruits so for her fruit i got a couple of baskets and these are things i already had so i had this little guy that i thought would look really cute to put fruit inside of this little guy um and i have one more basket but it's inside and then as far as decor i have this little thing that i would like to hang up i also have this little guy and i might not use all these things i'm just like showing you guys random things that i found around the house i have this little thing maybe i'll put this outside on the little table i also have this this is pretty heavy i might put this on the outside maybe the inside i don't know we'll see it's like very durable i also have this little play phone i meant to put this inside of her playroom but i think this will look so much cuter inside there so it's just a cute little old-school phone um i also have this little plant this little thing i was thinking i could use this for like silverware forks and knives and then last thing is this rug now this rug is pretty big i'm not sure that it would even fit on the inside maybe i'll use it on the outside just like a little thing or maybe i don't know we'll see i have this extra rug that i think would look cute so i want to make things gender neutral so both her and ari can use it that is my little haul i hope you guys enjoyed this again i'm just having fun i've been like sleeping and dreaming about doing this so i'm very excited and let's um start by painting it   foreign   do   okay alathia's out here but we're only adding a couple of like little things i'm not adding like the final decor just yet because i'm gonna wait for her to go inside but i'm adding all of the things back so i have the sink i have the top of her grill a little handle for her sink um and then we're gonna reattach the grill over there so i'm just adding these like little random knickknacks first and then my favorite part now is when i get to actually decorate the inside so i'm very excited lord's number okay so we're putting up the house number i got ones i kind of like hover over i think like that yeah that's cute alrighty here i have everything that i want to hang up so two picture frames i was gonna put one of elaithi and her best friend ellie and then her and ari or a picture of me and like the whole family or something um but we have our newborn photo shoot this week so i think i'm gonna wait to put those in there so i'm gonna hold off on those but i'm still gonna hang them up i also found this at home goods that is just like a cute little basket it was five bucks i'm gonna hang it upside down and use it as like a little pendant and then use this to hold it up um i wanted to hang these little pots like this on the wall and then i have this big guy that i'm going to hang her like little fruit in so um jordan is busy right now so i'm going to try and figure out how to do this i did get command strips for everything and then i got this big hook thing that we already had for this guy so i'm gonna see if i can figure this out once i do this then i'll start decorating with like all the cute little artsy fartsy things that will make it super cute we are in tukey's house i drilled a hole inside of this and tied a little knot so it can like hang um i was thinking of putting it like right in the middle and then making it hang down just a little bit um and then i don't know i'm gonna see what i'm gonna do to make it like stay but i'm gonna put the command hook up first it's so small in here i don't know if you can see but i hung it up let's hope it stays it's like a little bit taller than she i might have to put it up a little bit more once she's in here i'll see but now i have this fruit basket right here that i found at home goods and i would like to put it right here so she can like reach all her foods and veggies and whatnot um so i'm gonna play around with it and see where it would look best but i think that's my goal okay i originally wanted to put it right here in front of like this thing but it's not really going to work because the ceiling is way up there and i don't know how i would make it like stick out without it looking weird but i can put it right here in this little corner so i think it would be the perfect height it might you like might be able to see it from the outside but i think it's gonna look really cute and then it's lower actually so it's easier for her to reach this higher basket but i think that's gonna look cute and then i can put nice cute little things up there too don't be fooled because i really don't know what i'm doing it just seems like i do moment of truth cute so cute okay now over here she has like the little girl area i have it these little stainless steel pots and pan that's thinking of like putting little command hooks like this to hang them on   okay so what we're looking like so far i had to add her rain boots i had to um i'm not obsessed with how it looks out here so i have a couple of different plants and options i'm gonna try um and see if this looks a little bit better and then i feel like this looks kind of weird it's not really what i thought it would look like so i might just leave it like that with just like the little flower we'll see we'll see but i have these little fruits that i found at ikea i'm gonna put in her little fruit basket and then here's her like fake phone um i don't know what happened to it but i'm gonna try and hang this up by myself       do you want to go see whoa   look at your pots look on thai pots you want to cook   your fruits   you want to smell   smells great shadow bomb looks like you got carrots like some lettuce   your own you can wash your hands in your own sink look dookie you have your own light   a light so cute i want

takes i love your house you like it dude i love you you like it so thank you my mind can you say thank you hey guys welcome to my channel or welcome back today i am going to be taking you guys behind the scenes of how i do my youtube videos from the very start to the very end of it so i'm about to actually sit down and film a video so i was like hold up i have to film this other video to show you guys the behind the scenes it's gonna be very like mine and it's gonna be very like inception like for me to film this because i'm gonna be doing like two things at the same time even though i am a mom i'm still not really good at doing that so i'm gonna be giving you guys all the inside scoop i'm gonna share with you guys all the equipment that i use all of the apps all of the things all the details all my secrets of what i use to make my videos come to life so there's no right or wrong way to do youtube which is why i feel like this video is so interesting because i would love to see how other youtubers do things just to like get an idea you know because like i said there's no right or wrong way to do it because it's unique to each person and that's what makes youtube so much fun so if any of you have a channel right now and you are curious to see how others do it or if you're curious about starting one and you want some more information on it hopefully this video helps you guys out but i guess we'll just jump right into it so first thing i do excuse me let's adjust here what's going on okay so first thing i do when planning out a video is planning out what type of video it's gonna be so i mainly film two types of videos either vlogs or more chatty sit down i don't really do like anything other than that i mean you can get really technical and make it a whole production i don't do that so i am planning for more of a sit-down video so the video i'm specifically planning is gonna go something along the lines of parenting styles or parenting things i don't subscribe to so for me i personally like to think of the title first because if i can think of the title then it makes it a lot easier for me to know what to incorporate inside of the video if that makes sense so for me that's just what i that's like how my brain functions so i always think of the title now i'm going to be thinking of what i'm actually going to be saying in the video so normally it takes me about a week to kind of think and plan through a video so i've been marinating this thought for a couple of probably two weeks now um and so i've been i feel like my my best like video ideas come to me like before i go to bed or like when i'm in the shower or like when i'm working out so normally i'll always have my phone with me obviously so like write a couple of things that i think of but right before i film a video i will have my notebook with me and physically write things out so i do write out basically everything that i will say or want to say in a video not in like a super formal outline but just so i don't forget certain things so i have a short little list here saved in my notes of things i want to write down to say so i'm going to do that right now i have my salad here with me i'm like eating my lunch right now and then i have ari over there napping alexia is also napping upstairs so when the kids nap is like when i like to film because it's obviously quiet in the house so i'm gonna do this and that is first thing is prep and plan out the video   okay so i was gonna wait for alethia to wake up from her nap for her grandma to come pick her up for me to record the video but i think she's gonna nap a little bit longer so i'm actually gonna try and film it right now while her and aria are both snapping so i'm going to set up my stuff so normally first thing i pick a quarter quote location to film i love filming in my office because as you guys can see the lighting is really good and it's kind of like why i made this whole space to begin with so i have a closet right here so in my office right here i had these built-ins made and i made sure to have one really long one like this to be able to fit all of my equipment and whatnot so i used to be really fancy with what i used to use to film i have light boxes in there i have my ring light and then i have my tripod but since the lighting in this house is so much better than my previous house and i normally film during the day i don't even use my box lights anymore i sometimes don't even use my ring light anymore so first i'm gonna set up my tripod with my camera and see how that looks if the lighting looks bad then i'll bring out my ring light if not then we're good the simpler the better so i normally set it up like somewhere over here so i'm going to do that real quick i told you it was really quick i just literally have to set it up so when i first started off i didn't really invest in a camera you can easily just film on your iphone to be honest um you don't feel like you have to spend thousands of dollars on a tripod and all this lighting and all that depending on the type of video you're gonna be doing you don't really need to do that um daylight is your best friend the sun looks so good if i'm gonna be filming at night which i rarely ever do then i'll have stuff set up um but don't feel like you have to spend all this money because the iphone quality is really good so i'm going to set up my camera because i don't because i'm currently filming on it so i'm saying it's a little mine inception here but um i'm going to get all my stuff adjusted i normally like to drink an iced coffee or a matcha or something while i film so i'm gonna go make that real quick and then i'll sit down and get started to film so i make sure that everything is quiet in the house because i have more than one person here so make sure that the dogs are good kids are good people know i'm gonna be filming so i don't get interrupted in the middle of filming so i'm gonna put all those get that stuff all in order and then i will start recording okay i just went and filmed the video once i wasn't obsessed with it so i'm going to film it one more time and i feel like this happens frequently because sometimes i feel like i forget to say certain things or i like word things weird i try my best to edit myself as i talk meaning when i am talking i'm very cautious of how i'm saying things to make my editing process a lot easier and yes i did cut myself from wearing a pep of the pig booboo band-aid um but for example if i start saying something and i say it wrong i pause and then i restate the entire sentence again so then that way when i'm editing it's a lot easier for me to cut and edit so i'm not like splicing and cutting and doing so much work to make my sentence flow better if that makes sense so um i feel like i slipped up a couple of times um my thoughts were kind of like all over the place and i didn't really like my intro so i'm gonna reshoot and that happens frequently which is fine um but yeah i'm gonna do it again so it's been actually like probably an hour or so i like fed ari alaithia is at her grandma's house now so i'm going to redo my video alright it is the next day so when i film my videos it normally is a two day process because one day i will film the next day i will edit and post it so um i feel like some people take a couple more days than that some people take leslie than that there are some days if i don't do anything else i can film a video edit and post it in the same day that's it's a lot though and i try not to do that because then i don't end up seeing my kids at all so i like to break it down into two days so i'm going to show you guys all the equipment that i use and then i'll show you guys my editing software and then my process for editing to make it smooth and quick and fast i could hire an editor but to me editing is my favorite part and i think editing is like what makes your videos unique to you because i feel like everyone has their own editing style and although someone could duplicate that i really feel like that's like my creative outlet and the way that i don't know i just enjoy that process so i'm not at the point where i feel like i need to hire an editor just yet maybe down the line in a couple of years once i take on a couple more projects or have more kids and just need to devote my time to something else but for right now i really enjoy that process so i'm just now having my coffee today but okay let's let's see the thing okay this is basically everything that i need to edit my video so i'm gonna kind of break everything down so obviously first i have my laptop now i used to edit on my big mac but for some reason i just like this so much better i don't know what it is but it's so much quicker for me so i've been using this along with that and i really do not like apple for doing this because it's such a waste of money so do not get this i this macbook i think it's a macbook pro whatever last year's version is but they have these things here now where you have to buy these stupid extensions to put anything into it which is a huge waste of money so here i have an external hard drive where i store all of my stuff on and then i have this which is where i put my sd card so can't live without that in my laptop in addition to that i also have my ipad i use this a lot for photos and editing my photos and also for what's probably dead um i use this for to make my own like little graphics and stuff so i'll show you guys whenever i go to do that also some blue light glasses i don't use them every time but i do like having them because sometimes my eyes feel kind of strained and then i have my youtube notebook here and this is where i keep all my notes and stuff and then my pen which you need to use this i mean you don't need it but i feel like this has helped a lot with like making my stuff look smooth my water and then my coffee and my sweet little baby that is so cute and when i get stressed out i just look at him and all is well okay so i have this pulled up here this is what i use to edit my videos it's called it's called adobe premiere pro i have used this only forever like this is the only editing program i've ever used because i had a pc or like a windows when i first started and final cut pro which is what a lot of people use is not available on that so it wasn't until i got a mac that i was able to have final cut pro but i don't want to relearn a program so i've used adobe um i do it you do have to pay for it monthly but you also get adobe and every other adobe product that they have which is photoshop lightroom all these tons of other things um they also have it's like what i used to do my devotional and create my devotional that i launched so so many programs on there that you can use like graphic design stuff i don't know how to use all of them but they do have those options and if you are a student i believe there's a pretty big discount i think it's like 10 every month that you can save so um that's that so i'll share with you guys all the things that i'm currently subscribed to that help me edit my videos adobe premiere pro and then for my uh for my sound and my music i use epidemic sound and i started using epidemic sound when i was with my first management company um they gave it to us for free it was like part of like what we would get and after i am not with them anymore i still use that program and i just pay for it myself i think it's ten dollars a month and then another thing that i pay for is canva and i really like canva for editing things and thumbnails um any just like random little graphic design things i have to do and then lastly for my thumbnails i use pic monkey and picmonkey is great i pay for that as well um because i just want to have all the options so i use picmonkey and in shot so when i go to do that i'll show you guys how i do it but those are all the programs that i use at first i didn't pay for all of those programs because you can use them for free but then as i've just gotten more and more used to it and i use it so much it made more sense for me to pay for it so first thing i do when i'm editing my video is i will go through all of my footage and i will splice it all together and put it together so and when i do that i do just like normal editing so all i'm going to be doing right now is basically cutting out any us blanks space pauses uh what else like if i say something that's wrong and i rephrase it i'm gonna take that out so very like basic edits first this normally takes me about an hour to an hour and a half depending on how many times i mess up which is why i was saying yesterday when i go to actually record i talk very editorial-ish so it's like easy for me to edit later on to make it easier for myself so that's what i'm gonna do right now um and then i'll check back in with you is just such a guys representation of christ and it's just everything's connected so didn't mean to like make this all into something that it's not but everything is connected so didn't mean to like make this all something that it's not but i have a list here of things i want to share with you guys that i don't subscribe to that i don't really do with alexia all right i'm now recording on my phone because i only have one camera and i have nowhere else to record so i just went through and did basic edits on my videos so this is what my timeline currently looks like as you can see i just have just like basic edits right here just like little cuts of like where i messed up and whatnot i didn't add any graphics or anything like that so now the next thing i'm going to do is that so i always add a bible verse in the beginning so i left room for that i'm gonna add any graphics that i may like so i normally do them on my ipad with my pen and everything um i use a app called procreate i believe is what it's called and it makes it very easy for you to just like doodle your own things but this is dead right now and i do not have time to wait for it to charge so i am just going to use text that they have in adobe right over here um so i'm just going to add that in and anything like special so this is what actually requires the most amount of time which are like adding sound and graphics and like little things that will make a video from black i am self-taught when it comes to doing all of this i spent probably like three months learning how to edit because it can be a little bit tricky and if you're constantly having to stop to learn something it could take hours to edit a video so i will link someplace some people down below that i really like that have edits on how to edit like this and then also my inspiration i have a couple of people that i follow on youtube that have really cute editing styles that i have kind of taken in and made my own and used as inspiration so i'll link those down below as well um but yeah that's what i'm going to do right now and make the video fun and cute so i'm adding a photo right now which is an image of this account that i'm talking about that i follow on instagram so one thing i did and this is how i use my phone and my laptop a lot at the same time i took a screenshot on my phone of this account and then i exported it and airdropped it to here which is why i love using mac airdrop makes it so easy and so convenient i look crazy in this clip but um it makes it so easy to bring things back and forth so i exported it i inserted it here and now i'm going to i'm going to export two things first i'm going to use my beige piece of tape i'm gonna export that that i'm gonna use to like make look all cute so just drag and drop it onto my timeline and then i have to like make it smaller i gotta turn it and i'm going to put it on the top i don't want to like cover their name or their profile i think like right there will be fine like that and like i said to make it interesting i like adding little sound effects so i like the bubble bleep bleep one so drag and drop that right when i start to talk about it so now we'll hear one is big little feelings and this account has like completely changed her way and like so that's just example of one of the probably 20 of these that i'll make so that's kind of like what the overall process looks like of what i normally do again people probably do this differently but this is just what i have found is very effective for me okay hi i'm checking back in um one thing i forgot to mention that i do when watching through my videos and adding my graphics is i will write down anything that i say oh sorry um i will write down any things that i say in the video that i'm going to link so i said in this video i was going to link a couple of instagram accounts so i'm going to write those down so i remember to link them because i tend to forget sometimes so i'm writing those down and then this makes it a lot easier for me when i go to do my description box and then i'm also looking for my thumbnail so i don't like to take pictures after the fact i don't really do that anymore i really like taking a picture from the actual video because then i feel like you guys get a better idea of what that video is going to be like um i still haven't decided if i'm going to take a thumbnail with olathe instead and see how that looks um i might do that when she wakes up from her nap if i don't find a like a good picture that i can take from the video um but that's normally something i will also look out for when editing and doing like the third round of going through them okay almost show time baby we are done with our edits so like i said i thought i was gonna do more graphics and add like and make it more fun and cute but i was doing it and it like started to look weird because i was having to make the graphics really long sentences of like what the like hacks were and it like started to look weird so i took that out because it was like distracting from what i was saying so i actually haven't had to do that many cuts or edits to it so it only took me a couple of hours to finish and watch it through the only thing that i did do like slightly different is i did color grade because like i was saying i was looking a little bit orange and like the color was a little bit off so i fixed that and now i watched it through already so by the end of this entire editing process i get so sick and tired of the footage like there are some times where i'm editing a video and i'm like i cannot stand to hear my voice for another minute so i just like listened to it so much um all edits are done i am going to export this um and what i like to do when exporting is create my thumbnail so while it's exporting it normally can take anywhere between 5 to 20 minutes and then after exporting i put it right into youtube and youtube probably takes 30 to 40 minutes to fully upload and process and do all of that so in that like hour-ish time is when i will create my thumbnail do the description box do the promos do all of that stuff for this video so i'm gonna get started on that and now that i'm thinking about it i think it will make more sense for me to include alatia in my thumbnail since it is like a thing about parenting anyway so she is napping right now so i am gonna have to wait for her to wake up for me to take that so what i'm gonna work on right now is my description box so description box is something that i do put a lot of time into i do have like a standard description box that i put in all of my boxes but each one varies so a couple of things that i always change is anything that i mention or link and then i always like to include a shop this video where i'll include like the shirt that i'm wearing the jewelry lipstick or like things in the background of my video if it's a vlog and i like talk about or show certain things that ari is using or whatnot i will include those um because i feel like i normally get asked those things anyway so i kind of just try to kill two birds with one stone so i have that already saved in my notes so like i said i'm gonna go through my little notebook here of things that i wrote down that i said i was gonna link and i am going to do just that okay so miss aleitha woke up from her nap um she's getting she's eating right now and then she's gonna go to swim class but i took a couple of pictures with her and i'm going to add my filter to them so this is the same filter that i have on my instagram i also do it for my thumbnails um i think it really helps distinguish my photos because i don't use the same font or color every time with my thumbnail i'm going to pick one i have a couple of different ones that i thought were cute but i'll show them to you guys and then y'all can vote and let me know what you think is cuter i normally like to take pictures on my camera because it's already the size that it needs to be for the thumbnail but on here it won't be the exact size they will have to adjust it a little bit but i have this picture this picture which i thought was cute and then this one because look at that face i can't can we just like i feel like this is like parenting in a thumbnail right there so i think i'll probably end up doing this one but my video is taking 50 minutes right now because i did color grade and this is exactly why i don't like to because it takes so much longer for it to export and like finish the files what i'm gonna do is i will just be showing you guys what i do for my thumbnail so i really like in shot which is this app right here because it's the best one that i have found to like size the photos so okay so there's this option right here it's called canvas and i picked these 16 by nine options so as you can tell like there's like room on the sides so you can either zoom in or and do that or you can do that and then add a white background and then like move it over and then use this dead space to like write out text or something i'll sometimes do that i'm just gonna kind of play around with it i'm not gonna like full blown talk through my thinking process when creating a thumbnail because i feel like it can be a little redundant and i do the same thing over and over again like i keep moving things around so i'll just kind of like timelapse what that looks   like okay guys i apologize if this video has seemed more like scatter brain than i normally am outside of my normal scattered rainness but ari has been having a really hard time napping today i don't know what's wrong um i've tried like everything and he's been awake for a very long time so it's been like kind of hard for me to like sit and focus and do something but i showed you guys how i edit my thumbnails on my phone sometimes i will use both in shot and picmonkey so what i'll do is i'll use in shot to format and make it the correct sizing and then i will air drop it onto my computer and then use picmonkey um but i'm still waiting for this to finish encoding it's taking a really long time but i'm done doing everything that i need to do and all that's left is to actually post it on youtube and that will take a little bit of time but as far as like getting everything else ready as far as my description box thumbnail everything else is already done it's just the whole posting part that i'm waiting on so i am going to finish my afternoon coffee because i cannot do the afternoon without my coffee i around like four o'clock i feel like as a dead zombie so i'm gonna chug this away and while i wait i'm gonna do a couple of emails definitely gonna put these on because i feel like my eyes are starting to get strained so i'm gonna answer some emails do a couple of stuff for our podcast real quick and then i will check back in with you guys whenever this bad boy is done   all righty i'm back finally i have gotten this up onto youtube so when uploading i make my videos unlisted meaning that no one can see them unless they have the link to the video this is what a lot of brands will have you do when you are doing a sponsorship so they can watch the video before so they can ask if you can make any edits or anything so i always leave it up at unlisted um i just went ahead and added the the the title i added my description box everything i want on there i also already added my cards my monetization thank it you ends i think you need help okay so i just posted the video it's live that is what the start to the very finish of creating a video looks like i probably forgot a couple of things that i like routinely do that i don't even think about so if there's something that might seem confusing or if you guys have any questions definitely comment them down below and i will try my best to answer them like i said there's no right or wrong way to do this i'm just sharing how i do it um and then after posting a video i will spend at least an hour replying to comments that's something that i routinely do but like today it's been quite the day i'm not going to do that until tomorrow and then that way more comments accumulate and i can talk to more of you so that is that hope you guys enjoyed don't forget to subscribe and comment if you want more videos like this more in-depth um behind the scenes things and i'll do that i love you guys and i'll see you my next video okay i guys good morning welcome back to my channel today's video is going to be basically a day in the life we have ari's newborn photo shoot today which i'm so excited about esther who is my best friend that does our photo shoots her daughter is alathia's age she's uh six months younger than her almost to the day so they are coming over and alysia's having a little play date but we're also gonna do ari's newborn photo shoots so right now it's actually a little bit later it's almost 12. jordan is back in town but only for a couple of weeks and he has to go into the office when he is in town so he just left um and i had my morning workout today but it had been at least three weeks since i had worked out hello so i didn't do anything crazy i just did something very light and easy so i'm still my workout clothes because we had the photo shoot i haven't even changed out of it yet because i don't want to put on my clothes until right before because you know babies sit down smile smile right here right here right here there look there's two hello hi smile how are you i'm not mark okay how are you you sit back here so you can smile i honestly don't remember what i was saying but in the beginning of the video i was putting everything away we had our carpets cleaned yesterday we always have stanley steemer come um i'd say like every other month to come clean the carpets because our carpets are pretty light and we have dogs and we have kids there was poop on the stairs that you know just like the house just gets dirty really easily so we have them come pretty frequently they really they normally have a lot of sales so we wait until they have a sale and then we do just the upstairs um so i was putting everything away for that it's almost 12 o'clock that's when she goes down for her nap ari has already taken one nap today i'm gonna put him down for a nap right now i like to keep them on the same schedule alathia normally naps from 12 until three so it's a pretty big chunk of a nap and i wanted ari to go down at the same time so i can actually like get some things done so that's what i'm going to do right now i'm going to get ari ready i already gave olafia her bottle she's just kind of walking around with it and playing a little bit so while she does that i'm gonna to get mr ari situated baby voice warning hi ari hi sweet boy hello he already ate and he was playing a little bit so he is ready to go down for his nap i don't put him to nap in the snoo anymore i kind of want him to get not used to being in there all the time so i have been putting him to nap in his crib which has worked out pretty well so i'm gonna get him situated and i'll show you guys what i do for that hi pretty boy hi hi jigs alright so i do like to swaddle him up so he stays warm but also so he feels nice and secure we have this one right here that has like the little arms up so he can move his arms because he likes to do that i do put him with a binky as well so i have that um i can't find ari's sound machine from when we traveled to new york i mean i have the sound machine but i can't find the core to it so i have my sound machine in here right now which i'm gonna turn on i'm gonna close his blinds and the curtains he has a window inside of his closet so i have to close this now it's nice and dark in here okay i plugged in my sound machine for him and he's just about to fall asleep so he's good yeah you want it   you're not gonna go on that one you're gonna go in your crib let's go to your room   okay did a quick little tidy up up here i did not clean her play room though because i want her to clean that but i have not been doing my makeup that much because i've been using it self tanner drops on my face so my face is finally the same color as my body i normally don't tan my face in the sun because i don't want my face to really age so i always cover my face but then it gets really white and then my skin is really tan and it just like looks kind of strange if i'm not wearing makeup so i started using the iowa paradise straps and i really like them um so i haven't worn makeup in a while so i'm gonna do my makeup right now i feel like i don't really know what i'm doing anymore because it's been a minute um and then i'm also going to kind of touch up my hair so i did do a hair treatment on my hair this is it natural right now but if you've followed me before you would know that my hair is like not normally natural like this i did have a few curls more towards like the bottom right here more like tight ringlets um and then the top would kind of be more relaxed but really really frizzy and it was just kind of annoying to deal with so i did a hair treatment i don't remember what it was called i haven't even like brushed my hair or done anything to it and this is like what it looks like and i'm really happy with how it turned out because i still have like some wave and texture to it but no frizziness which no one wants to deal with the frizziness so i love that i'm going to leave my hair natural like this because for our shoe i want it to be more of like a um more like in-home shoot more natural more i don't know just more natural so i am going to add a couple more curls into my hair with this waiver thing because like this is kind of like already the texture i have so i'm just going to lightly go over it with this um to just like give it a little bit more definition in some places and that will do that   okay i am just about done getting ready i just have to change my outfit but i'm hesitant to change just yet because like i said kids spit up throw up so i'm just gonna add a little bit of oil to my hair and then for my skin and the rest of my face just did really light makeup i still need to put my lipstick on um and i need to curl my eyelashes the key to like good lashes is a good eyelash curler um i think i hear all right crying i'll be right back hi are you done napping are you ready for your photoshoot today what do you wanna wear are you ready for yourself   are you ready for your photoshoot are you ready for your photo shoot sir oh stretch stretch oh that's why you woke up you needed to burp again you needed to burst again okay let's i hope he falls back asleep because he didn't even sleep for more than 30 minutes i think he just wants me to hold him so i'm going to put this wrap on real quick and have him nap on me instead why do these things have to be so long i really don't think it's that necessary are you guys okay are you guys okay   um come back up dudes they shall reach   through well okay guys it's been a couple of days the clip of my my camera falling and breaking it actually did break i broke my first camera ever which i've never done before so that was a bit of a damper i am on a new camera right now it probably looks a little bit different and i apologize for the audio it might be a little bit bad i did just order a new mic for it this camera but everything is literally sold out and nothing is in stock so i just had to order it so it will be a couple of days until it gets here but i'm excited to have like new audio and new equipment i feel like it's always like exciting to get all that new stuff it's quite the bummer and i will say i do think it was somewhat of a spiritual attack because right before so it was a wednesday when i was filming this video or this vlog that you guys are watching right now the day before that i did a poll on instagram asking questions and like kind of trying to get a feel for things and i asked questions about the podcast and i was like how many of you would listen to the podcast if we had a youtube channel we've been meaning to make a youtube channel for a long time now um but we just haven't gotten around to it because we kept like overthinking it and i was like oh we'll have to get a whole new camera for that and like the whole setup will be different and it was just like a lot and we had so much going on so we kept like pushing it back but then i was like you know what i'm just gonna use the camera i already have we'll figure it out we'll make it work and as we go we'll like improve the equipment whatever like let's just get it started and literally the next day my camera broke that i had intended on using it and it was so strange i've dropped my camera so many times olathe has jeweled on it alicia has thrown it down the stairs like this camera took a beating and it didn't even fall like a foot off the ground and it like completely broke so i thought that was a little sauce but then not only that but then the next day i had my first uc flare-up that i've ever had that was painful like i felt like i was in labor and having contractions they were coming on in like waves every like five to ten minutes in like intense pain for like two minutes and then it would kind of go away so i just felt like last week was kind of like a rough week where the enemy was like doing his thing he was going overtime like i've said so i don't know i might be looking into it too much but you never know so i'm picking the vlog back up it is a couple of days later um my mother's day push present came in right honey jordan's home for the week and my push present mother's day present came in which is a little bike i ordered this from elena back in early may yeah now mid-september yeah here's the beauty we still need to actually build it but i'm so excited i've never had a bike as an adult only as a child and i love the look of like the vintage old bikes and jordan was so sweet and found one so we're gonna put this bad boy together i did just buy a little thing to attach a lathia to it back here like for a child seat so we'll see if that fits on there i'd love to go on a bike ride with her i feel like she would really enjoy that so yeah that's what we're going to be doing today honestly i don't even remember what i had put originally in the vlog i was so bummed because i wanted to show you guys like behind the scenes of his newborn shoe and show you guys how esther shoots which is my best friend she shoots like everything for us i love her to death and love her work but i wanted to show you guys because she like sets the mood so well she'll play really common christian music and like she's just so encouraging and sweet and like the whole atmosphere of this shoot is so so like so unique and calming and it like makes you feel really comfortable so i wanted to show you guys that but obviously my camera had other plans oh hi tiny humans he's like so infatuated with the camera wow are you ready to eat oh it's similar to knocking on the door but we're burping him like this i could similar to knocking on the door but like this with your hand open so it doesn't hurt yeah open it there you go and then he's gonna go like this he's gonna   i found these really cute little pups on amazon for kids and they like kind of look like yetis and they can have it with the straw or like ship it like normal i'll link it down below but i'm very impressed and then i also found silverware from ikea they have a whole set with a knife which she's been wanting a knife she always asks for mine so it's kid's size and it was like five bucks for it all which is really affordable compared to other silverware that i have found now okay we just got the sweetest little package from jess and gabe for ari and it's this little mobile and it's so cute and it's going to match the room so well with the yellow orangey color i don't know if i should put it like in the middle we're off to the side   i don't know if it's because this new camera or what but i feel like i'm not the lighting is looking a little bit strange i kind of have to play around with it because it's kind of making me look like i have a mustache and a beard and i promise you i don't but i'm gonna close out today's video hello hello hello who's there is dada can you take a picture of me okay uh amazing smile she's like figured out how to use my phone recently but i'm gonna close that today's video hope you guys enjoyed more of these laid-back vlogs i'm definitely gonna do more vlogs because i assume you guys really seem to like them and enjoyed them more um and re is getting so big already so i want to make sure to capture all these little moments but i love you guys and i will see you in my next vlog can you say bye to everyone bye bye hello good morning good morning hi are you so erected   tell me what is that what you dreamed about no wait hey guys good morning welcome back to my channel today i'm going to be doing a day in the life of a newborn again i apologize for the audio my microphone still hasn't come in so it might be a little bit more foggy i'm going to try to edit and like make it a little bit better but i apologize for that hopefully the next video after this one won't be as bad but ari is actually three months old now so technically he's not considered a newborn anymore but i thought i would just do this video quickly before he just gets so much older so i'm gonna show you guys his schedule his feeding schedule his play schedule what i do with him to keep him entertained and busy and all that good stuff and i hope you guys enjoyed today's video okay alithea is still sleeping he normally wakes up around seven and i'll try my best to like time stamp this video as well um but he wakes up before her lazy doesn't wake up until later so he wakes up with us and i'm gonna work out and he's gonna play in a little gym a little bit and keep himself busy i just changed his diaper but i am going to keep him in this piece just for a little bit longer because it's really cute and snuggly is what this little treasure is on         ah   okay it's been about an hour since he woke up for the day and he played a little bit now and he was starting to scream a little bit and he's really sleepy so i'm just going to rock him a little bit and then i'm going to put him either in the mama roo or one of like his other little things down here for him to take his first little nap of the day but one of my favorite things about ari is that he loves to be rocked like loves like look how he's like holding on to me he just it's just the sweetest little thing hello all right he's been sleeping for about an hour an hour and 15 minutes now he's awake for the day wanna go say hi to your hi momma hi baby who's that hi you think good morning ari   are you okay are you okay okay i'm gonna go change our sniper okay you enjoy your breakfast   you want to change ari okay you can put him in his outfit of the day okay   wow   is he is   hello   why do you have a binky okay we are gonna go on a family bike ride right now i am wearing ari right here with me and i'm gonna ride with him on me um and then alecia's gonna go in the back of the bike but i love getting i love trying to get them outside as much as i can while it's still nice out so this is a great little way to do that get some fresh air he actually already did fall asleep so hopefully he'll just stay asleep and relax while we go on a bike ride okay he is still passed out i'm gonna try and transfer him from in here to inside the mamaroo again um or maybe yeah i'm gonna put him in the mamaroo because it will swing him okay i had just enough time to scarf down my lunch before mr ari is ready to eat because i am breastfeeding i'm already on my third yeti of the day i've noticed a huge difference in my supply if i don't drink water so i try really hard to drink as much water as i can because i do really feel like it helps with my supply so mr ari you ready   actually i'm going to change this diaper real quick before so i don't have to lay him back down after he gets okay okay i'm gonna stop talking now all right he's all done eating he normally eats and takes about eight minutes on each side so it's like 16 minutes of feeding um and then after that i like to hold him upright for like at least 30 minutes after he doesn't have his acid reflux anymore thank god and i apologize for this angle i don't know it's just the way we're doing it now but um because of his acid reflux which he does not have anymore thank the lord um i just still gets kind of scared so i just always hold him upright like this for a little bit after i have the tv turned on but there's nothing playing but he won't stop looking at the tv so i'm just letting him burp now olathe should be waking up pretty soon um so hopefully i'll be able to finish a couple of things on the computer real quick hold him upright with me and then once alathia wakes up we can do some sensory play with them together oh my goodness oh my gosh you got boogers oh what are we are you guys screaming are you eating at your phone right now as well because i it's so hard not to just like his cheeks we call him density like literally i call him density now because his cheeks are just like so dense and he's just so much mush do you see do you do you see this it's like pierce thickness pure tick myth and he will not take his eyes off that tv oh my gosh he's the roundest little chin ever too look at this all right we are upstairs in the playroom and i thought i would show you guys kind of how i entertain my newborn so it's encouraged to try to like entertain them and play with them while they're awake to kind of help them get stimulated and like get the little brains going so they sleep a little bit longer because we all want our babies to sleep more am i right yes so i do a couple of things with him and kind of like rotate through these throughout the day i do them with alethia too alathia likes to do it with him i'll leave them to play a little bit sometimes too like just anything to just kind of help him um so he's not just like sitting there you know like it must be so boring to be a newborn because you literally eat sleep and then you like just sit there so i try to like kind of help him move his little body a little bit so first thing you can do to them is read and i cannot encourage you enough to read at least three books a day to your babies no matter the age um with him i haven't been the best at that honestly because life is a little hectic but with alathia i used to read to her every single time her eyes were awake when she was a baby so it's really good for them to hear your voice hear different words see the pages see the pictures it's very stimulating really good for them another thing that you can do is give them house tours and this one is funny um he's just like really got a desk up on my hair um but you can do house tours where you basically just like have them face out and kind of walk around the house like this and kind of tell them like where you are explain the room show them things have them touch different pillows and whatnot um it's just really simple and then other things you can do is like sensory things and that's what i'm going to do right now with him and one of the things i have is this these are like little silk um clots i guess i had them from alathia i still use them with her and i wish she was awake right now but she's sleeping so long so i'm just gonna let her sleep and just do this with ari um but this is a great activity too so basically what i'm gonna do is lay him down okay so i have him laid down i'm basically going to just take these and kind of like run them over his body and just like have him see the different colors um it's good to like get their little muscles moving because they're sleeping so much it's good to let their backs yeah stretch so i'm just gonna do this wow look at that right now he doesn't have that much of a reaction obviously but as they get older they'll get really excited and like the feeling of this like touching them the colors the sensation um the breeze of the air like all of that is like so new to them and so exciting so you might be looking at me like this lady is crazy like fanning over silk fabrics over her baby like i don't know just me like saying that out loud made me realize how crazy i actually look but i promise you it's really good for them and so simple like you can literally just like do this for like five minutes and your baby will love it yeah and you can talk to them it's just like a cute little activity to do so and if you have any siblings if you're if you have more than one kid they can do this with you um alesia loves doing anything with ari and she would freak out if she was awake right now that i'm doing this with him because she used to love this as well and i'll insert a clip of her when she was a newborn and i used to do this with her she used to like flail and like freak out and scream so obviously as he gets older he'll start to have more of a reaction to um yes this is so much fun yay silk fabrics but yeah they'll give you more of a reaction another thing that you can do with them too is just simply talk to them hi hansel look at your meaty little cookies um you can also do tummy time as well which babies love to do he rolled over earlier as you guys saw but there's tons of little things i feel like don't overthink it because literally anything that you do will be fun for your newborn so just try anything things i can do dance kiss make always with you jump clap brush my teeth help okay sissy's awake now she loves to play with him she tends to be pretty gentle right a peg what i picked what's that you want to pet him i did a you want ari to ride the pony what pony not the pony which pony daddy pony ride the pony okay mine what pony are you talking about you are so sweet okay yes it's diaper he's a poo poo no you kiss it oh thank you so it's almost six o'clock now and ari is probably going to eat at least one more time yes the cuckoo clock you like the cuckoo clock yeah okay we'll get your cuckoo clock okay so it's almost night time and i actually did do an entire video of our nighttime routine i actually did one of like our nighttime routine and then a sleep with us video so i basically showed you guys our routine throughout the whole night as well so if you guys want to see that i will link it down below so chatty cathy but that is what our schedule currently is like yes you want to read this book okay let me finish saying bye-bye and we'll read it okay but i hope this video was helpful um babies are hard to kind of routine in schedules so maybe tomorrow his routine will completely change and be different but i hope this was helpful to you guys i'll leave our nighttime routine and our sleepiness video down below i love you guys and i'll see you in my next video bye oh my goodness it's very quiet   good morning guys welcome back to my channel these are the first words coming out of my mouth i've been making a super hard effort to wake up before the kids do even if it's just like 10 to 15 minutes nothing like too dramatic and it has helped my sanity so much because i don't know about you guys but like from the second i wake up until the second i go to bed i am non-stop and that can be very exhausting and really rough on me so if i wake up before the kids and have a couple of minutes to myself a couple of minutes with the lord i am a changed woman i prom like i literally am a different person when i have this time so i always like to pray before opening up the word just to kind of help the lord guide me and kind of see what he wants me to read and my prayer today was like lord i don't know what to read i was like i don't know what you want me to read i'm feeling a little lost a little discouraged and i don't know i was i feel like i overthink it like many of us do and my prayer was lord just like reveal what you want me to read i want to read something i like want to find something to just continuously read i don't want to just like open up my bible every time and like read something new like i want to read something and read it through um so my prayer was for the lord to reveal something to me and i don't know if you could see it in the clip but you literally see me smile because of what i opened up to so i actually opened up to the psalms this is psalms 33. now the psalms is basically like a giant song the psalms are very poetic very beautifully written and psalm 33 the title is the steadfast love of the lord and i just thought it was really funny because i have been contemplating and like beating myself down for not reading his word and thinking always probably upset at me or he's i don't know i was just thinking like i haven't been putting the time for the lord and i feel bad but then i literally opened and said the steadfast love of the lord like god was like i love you either way i did take a couple of notes i promise i won't make this too long but i want to just encourage you guys um so a couple of things first thing i started to notice like i said it's kind of like a um like a poem like very like beautifully written so i kind of like wrote down a first couple of things that i noticed that the bible was saying was an action and then something that the lord does so or does that make sense like an action to do with having to do with the lord so the first thing is shout for joy give thanks make melody and sing to him and i love this because if you guys saw like a while ago on my instagram my mom and i did a story time where we actually talked about how i was listening to really bad music basically like really nasty rap songs like swearing cursing like just like really gross music and the lord revealed to my mom to tell me to stop listening to that music so since then i have and i've been listening to a lot of christian music and my best friend esther has this playlist on spotify it's called chill christian i'll link it down below i'm not sure if it's private but it's the best christian music ever and i have it on repeat all day long so i thought it was really funny that this says to shout for joy because when i'm praising worship i am and then it says give thanks make a melody which is basically just to sing and well make melody like make music to him and then sing to him so i just thought that was really funny like really relevant to what's going on in my life right now and then another thing i noticed was i have been trying really hard to fear the lord with social media guys it's it's really hard to want to fear what people are going to say of you and think of you and whatnot and that's always something that is on the back of my mind and it's very exhausting because i've like actually just made myself this way because i overthink everything and i probably don't even post half of the stuff that i want to post or do because in the back of my mind i'm like oh people are going to say this or oh people are going to think this or this so i'm not even gonna do it and that is such a toxic way of thinking i'm not sure if any of you can relate to that but i do fear what people think of me and something that the lord has really been putting on my heart is to fear him and not people and that's something i'm constantly reminding myself and that this scripture reminded me of as well so i read um psalms 33-34 and in those two the lord talks about fearing him four different times so that's something i wrote it can be a little scary sometimes to just like make the time for the lord i overthink it all the time i tell myself i'm too busy and it's not true i'm just not making it a priority so hopefully this will keep me accountable to keep doing this and hopefully this will kind of encourage you guys as well um but i'm going to go upstairs and get ready for the day so i have a hair appointment today which i'm really excited about i'm gonna do a quick gloss to kind of help with some of the brassiness um and just to like overall keep it a little healthy and my mom is coming so she can watch the kids because well i think i'm gonna keep ari with me because he's like with his feeding i just would rather have him with me to be able to feed him but my mom is coming to watch alethia while i go so um i go to a girl named katrin she actually works from her house and i love that because it's very cozy feeling i don't know about you guys but like salons sometimes can be very intimidating maybe not now during covid because i can't even like see anyone's faces but i always felt like the salon was like so intimidating is that i don't want to like agree with that it can be because i feel like it's a bunch of girls just like staring at each other all the time and it's like hi so i'm gonna go get dressed kids are still sleeping it's very quiet in this house and sugar   shook   so     okay bye mom thank you bye pianta please   hello okay i just got it done i'll show you guys when i get home just because i feel like the lighting is a little bit strange right here but oh my gosh guys she always says such a good job i love it we literally just did a gloss but it looks like i got a haircut and she like colored it it's crazy how much of a difference a gloss will make but my mom facetimed me and she was like ari's crying i do have some milk um saved well some milk i have a lot of milk saved in my freezer so she's gonna give her give him some of that and alecia was a little upset too so i'm gonna head home now but it was nice having a little mommy time and i will see you guys once i get there back home now i thought i would show you guys so we did a gloss um i can't i don't know what formula she did i'll ask her and i'll leave it down below but it makes such a big difference it like makes my hair look so much healthier kind of takes out the brassiness and then it makes my ends look super healthy so i normally get a i go in every six to eight weeks and then every other time i get a trim because i'm all about healthy hair like i really like to keep my hair healthy i like to get it trimmed i don't like the look of like split ends and dead looking hair so i do frequently get it cut but this time we didn't but the gloss like made my ends look overall really like healthy and hydrated because they were looking pretty crusty before i went um but yeah we love a little hair moment um but i'm gonna make myself some lunch right now jordan and i have a meeting in seven minutes and i actually forgot to like take my vitamins and do my whole routine before i left and today's video is sponsored by care of i love this brand to death as you guys can tell because it's so cool how you can just customize your own vitamins if you head on to their website it's a five minute quiz let them know what you like so like i just said i like healthy hair healthy nails that's a big priority for me also i just incorporated a vitamin d i still take a prenatal because i'm breastfeeding um there's a couple oh iron i also take an iron i'm very particular about the vitamins that i take and i've been really good about taking them consistently so sometimes i might not take it first thing in the morning but i will make sure to do it before like the afternoon this is what it looks like it's like a little dispenser like this which i think is really cute and then my favorite thing is that everything is already here and included so it's not like you have to open 15 different bottles of pills to take everything you just rip this open and it's all in here so this is everything that i take has your name on it which is really cute and then there's always like a cute little um challenge on there oh this is cute today's challenge is focus on building one habit or reaching a goal at a time love that you can also compost these little packs which i think is really nice um so i will leave my link down below for you guys if you guys would like to try it out so i have a new code with them it's milena c for 25 off your first three months which i think is really neat because in those three months you will truly see a huge difference so i will leave that link down below and my code as well for you guys but i'm gonna make a fresh salad right now so i really like having salads well let me take these first before i forget   so     so   alrighty all done with our call i just got a box and it's actually my new chair so i had originally had this chair i mean it's still in here but when i first when we like first moved into this house i kind of had a different idea of where i took this office and this green chair isn't it anymore so i'm going to give this to my best friend she's going to take it and i'm going to put together this one it came in a box i didn't think it would come in a box i thought it would like come as the actual chair so i'm probably going gonna have to do some assembling here this is what it looks like it's from world market i got it on sale for labor day so let's put this beauty together there she is she's so cute i wanted it like some type of texture in here because i feel like it looks a little stale and stark with the cabinets um and then i also did go a little bit crazy and get new desk and new chairs for right here i'm gonna sell this whole combo but i got a glass table and then for chairs you guys are probably familiar with them they're the black wood with cane um and i think it'll really help elevate this room and i'm very excited i'm not sure when that's supposed to come in i got it all on sale with labor day so hopefully i'll be able to finish off this room     you want to put it on yeah oh you want me to do it with your teeth can i see your teeth wow wow you have molars can you say molar you gotta change your diaper she's saying no jumping tell them tell them be nice alrighty well we were gonna go on a little family walk but alathia has been obsessed with her playroom the past like two weeks i'd say and she just wants to play up here so what do you have oh what is that a salad and this is chocolate you want to mix the salad okay there's a spoon so there was probably like i'd say a good like two months where she never set foot in this playroom like wanted nothing to do with it didn't want to play us anything and now she's obsessed with it and wants to come up here we'll spend like hours just like independently playing so i'm milking it y'all i'm milking it so i'm just gonna play with her for a little bit and then we'll probably go on a little walk or a little bike ride or something okay took the   like this okay we have your own sink we have our cups look we're going to turn it on wash wash   wash your cups yeah i'll get you a little towel so you can dry them off with

to hobby lobby and home goods um ari is napping he fell asleep on the play mat he's just sound asleep so i'm gonna wait to do his little um i'm gonna wait to do his little six uh six months it's not been six months yet i'm gonna wait to do his three month update whenever he wakes up so i guess i'll just do a quick little haul and sorry i keep not getting myself in frame this camera is a little bit different than my old one so i'm like not really used to it so let's do a quick little haul i went to just get that white thing where i and i don't even know where i put it i went for this frame thing that i was telling you guys about so i got that at hobby lobby but then there's a home goods right next door so it's like might as well just happen into what they have i have like a running list on the back of my mind that i always have of like random things i'd like to get but don't want to pay full price so i'm always like just popping in there to see if they have what i'm looking for one of those things was this so it's a little organizer to put inside the lathes drawer um and ferrari to put their bottles because i like how it's like the perfect size so i got two of them one to stack the bottles and then one to stack like the inside of the bottles um because that's always like getting really messy um alecia got a paw patrol thing i don't really know i wasn't in the mood to argue with her so i just got that um i found this look honey they're cute is that to make a guacamole i think so it's a natural wood one i've been looking for one of these but these are really expensive and this was 15 bucks so the main thing i was looking for there were some vases because in these built-in cabinets at the very top i have those two shelves and i never really knew what to put in there so what i'm actually gonna do is take out the middle one on both of them and then put a vase and then i also got a globe so i found this one and this one and they're a little bit taller than each other so i was gonna put these two on the same one again we'll see how it looks that's the thing about decor is you gotta try it and see if you find it at home good especially and then i found this globe that i thought was really cute so we'll see how that looks um that's all i got so i'm going to try and hang up those things and see how it looks it's kind of hard to do a gallery wall normally how we'll do it is i'll like lay it out on the ground and then we'll like make the holes but i have seen on pinterest i think where you can take like newspaper and make it the same size of the frame and then physically like hang it up temporarily and then you can just drill right through the like newspaper or whatever the little template and so you always make sure that you get it on the right spot because if you've ever hung out with gallery wall it can be a little bit tricky and annoying to get the placement right and everything so i think i'm gonna try that today and hopefully that will work out we also got some grace coffee and co no it's just grace coffee co what did i say coffee and co coffee and company   thanks this is so cute grace coffee company just ordered our order just came in they were really backward because everyone wanted it so it smells so good but it came actually pretty quickly all things considered wow you know with cove and whatnot   that is the colombian one oh yeah that's my favorite i got the whole bean so i could grind it here that's a little more fresh tasting yeah wait perfect timing of getting the coffee machine then that's what i said did you guys see that we got a coffee machine like a old school coffee machine well this is perfect what um it's not old school it's just it's a drip coffee machine it's like mr coffee so this is really good good job good job gabe i call you and claudio   all right mr ari is up i just fed him took a little break and i thought i would do his little three-month update so this is what he currently looks like and what his toes look like oh my gosh i love his toes i don't know what it is about them but they're so fat and so cute and then we have so his eyes are still blue right now i don't think they'll change i think they'll stay blue um just like mine he still has just a little bit of like little baby acne that he'll get like here and there um his hair is growing in so much like look at this little hair right here he already like went through that balding face so right now it's just like growing and it's so cute so it's like a light brown color what else what else do you do he sucks his thumb a lot he always has his little thumb in his mouth he's still breastfeeding and he eats really well and like loves to feed and eat and just play with my necklaces he's like really into this camera     okay look at that thumb so he started to also roll over he doesn't roll over that frequently um but if i like lay him on his stomach he'll always find a way to get to his back because he doesn't really like being on his stomach but he hasn't rolled like from his back to his stomach just yet um he doesn't like tummy time at all we don't like tummy time you know no huh he is sleeping through the night um i'd say there's like six days out of the week he'll sleep through the night and sometimes there'll be one night where he wakes up to eat or he just like needs his binky to be put back in his mouth um and i really attribute that to the snoo because lathey didn't sleep through the night until she was like six months old and he's three and you're already there so that alone like really helps um as far as his feeding schedule he goes about every three hours with eating um and then he goes to the potty all the time he always feels like you're always peeing you have a full diaper hmm um and then he's giggling as you guys saw i don't know if i'll get him to google that much but i'll insert a really cute video that i got of him giggling that he he just like is so infatuated with mine   and now with his naps his naps are like a whole nother story he's like not as consistent with his naps as he is like during the night um but there are some days where he just wants to be held and i talked about our instagram stories but i was like kind of just saying how difficult it has been because he just wants to be held and if i put him down he like screams bloody murder and i had so many people telling me to let him cry it out and i felt so bad because i will never do that like i can't i will not let my three month old cry it out he has no idea what's going on he can't like self soothe he's only three months old i'm like the only thing that brings him comfort and for me to like not hold him and let him cry it out i think is like abuse so i will not be doing that it's only been a couple of times where that has happened and it's just a phase and that's what i keep telling myself like after i posted those stories i was talking to a friend and she was like it comes and goes so quick um and that really put things into perspective because he's only gonna be crying for me pretty soon and then one day he's gonna be like mom i hate you and i want nothing to do with you so he wants the snuggles now and wants me to comfort him so that's what i'm gonna do because it's just a short season and the newborn face is so short like he's technically not even a newborn anymore so i will snuggle you as much as you want really what else happened when that happened   jordan and i were just doing a review over the podcast that we're posting this week or is it next week yeah this week um and if you guys remember about a year ago i did a youtube video on my channel it was called like being a christian wife and i kind of like list a couple of things that like as a christian wife that we probably do that's a little bit different than the world so it's going to be jordan's perspective on it and the last point that i made because we were just watching the video again to like refresh our memory but the last point was about prayer and i always joke and say that the lord has muted me every time i pray for jordan and then he brought it back to me what did you say i said um well why is my head look so small over here no it doesn't no yeah you do i have to be like this there now my head's too big it's all about angles yup and this lens is a little bit different too oh what did i say oh she's like well it's kind of hard to pray for your husband when god puts me on mute and i said i prayed too much i was like well maybe you've put god on mute because he's like have patience with your husband and she's like huh wait sorry god what'd you say sorry i couldn't hear that did you repeat yourself so too did you watch a video i posted a couple days ago my q a no i haven't watched it yet okay well jordan's normally good at watching him but one of the things i said was that i need to give you more patience so it's funny that you said that oh i'm sorry the lord uses us to speak to one another i know but yeah that podcast episode will be up and sometime this week i still need to do the gallery wall i'm pushing it off because it's hard can you do it nope okay no more putting this off i pulled everything out so i can stand up on there and this is the layout my mom and i made the other day you can't really see the pictures but it's not loading so that's kind of what i'm gonna do i'm gonna try and use the little nails that we already have on there first and see if it works and then if not i'll like redo some alrighty i am really struggling with this it's really hard to do a gallery wall without someone else there because first of all i'm like really lazy and did not do the newspaper thing i'm kind of just like drilling tons of holes in the wall and moving it as i feel like i need to but yeah like i was saying it's hard to do this because i not really following the plan that i thought i was gonna do and then it's kind of hard to like put it up because then i have no one to kind of help guide me so i'm actually gonna facetime my mom real quick and see what she thinks and what she suggests hi are you busy i'm working could you help me real quick i'm doing the gallery wall all by myself and it's by yourself yeah i'm a big girl   do you like it like on that side yeah either side what are you gonna put those two's gonna go as it'll be up well originally and the plans we didn't have those two we just had this one black one but then it looks kind of weird and like empty by itself so okay i'm vlogging you by the way why don't you put those two there and one behind the plant put to the right side the side no no other won't it be too busy over there so if you put that one with those two no if i put one i'll get rid of one of them okay there we go yeah she suggested i move that from there which makes sense because obviously this big plant is in the way so what i'm going to do is put it over here with that one because this is not originally supposed to be here and this frame is really dark compared to the rest so it kind of look out of place so i'll save that for something else all right decor has been added just wiped off the table with my sponge cloth you guys have heard me rave about this on instagram all the time but this thing is so cool it's a sponge and you can reuse it multiple times you can throw this in the wash and wash it and reuse it and reuse it and reuse it so it's a very like eco-friendly thing but it also cleans really well so i was just able to clean off the glass with just this and some water um so i did that and then this is what it currently looks like so i actually am going to remove that hanging chair i'm going to put it upstairs with alathia's play room um and then that way i'll be able to center this rug because right now everything's kind of pushed over this way because that's in the way so still don't know what i'm going to do about this rug i don't know if i want to leave just the faux cowhide or if i want to take out the cowhide and leave just this one so let me know what you guys think and like because i'm struggling pretty badly i'm gonna close out today's video i hope you guys enjoyed today's vlog i love you guys and i'll see you in my next video bye welcome back to s for me in my house i'm elena sorry i always forget to do that why am i forgetting it's okay who are you who am i i'm your husband we're gonna learn all about you being a husband today aren't we yes i am jordan if you're newer to the podcast welcome we are excited you're here and if you're a longtime listener we're also grateful for your passionate patronage not not patronizing us we don't want that but we are thankful for you continually coming back to support and to be a part of the as for me and my house family so we're trying the video today yes that's big i'm gonna wave at youtube real quick i had a hard time with it the first time around we've tried it a couple of times but this will be the one that goes up i promise good yeah i have no idea when it comes to that kind of stuff so i'm just deferring to molina on everything but as we jump into today's episode uh you could tell from the title we're gonna look at some of the perspective from me as a husband on what the bible says about treating your wife and being a husband so i need to throw out some major major major disclaimers though before we start well okay this isn't to say that we're experts in this i did a video almost over a year ago talking about being a christian wife and so many of you said that you would love to hear jordan's perspective on it and it took us a whole year to do it but we're here yeah so i was uh you know approached by molena and she says hey there's a lot of you were cornered by me i was given no choice by melina and said hey can you do this you know can we sit down and talk a little bit about from your perspective and maybe even share it on the podcast it's a little bit more long form it's a little bit more discussion and conversational yeah because jordan loves to chat i i hate talking if you if you haven't noticed but no i love uh just communicating and sitting down and having deep talks so this is my element and melania does too well likes this but she also likes her i love to be inside with my toe separation in bed the joy of missing out jomo yeah yeah that's melania for you so yeah a couple disclaimers um with that information so something that paul said uh the apostle paul is that he hasn't arrived at you know christian perspective perfection or some sort of holiness standard but he's striving towards that right he says i'm i haven't obtained it i haven't arrived yet but one thing i do is i forget what's behind and i strive forward towards what's ahead i think that still absolutely applies within our context of you know speaking from an authority on something right you don't have to be an authority to have knowledge and insight and information that could be useful for other people so that's where i'm coming from coming at this from as as humble of a heart perspective as possible being that i've only been a husband for about three years now and there are people that have been married for decades and stuff but that doesn't necessarily mean that you know you i have less to offer or or somebody who's been married longer has more to offer right so i just take it with a grain of salt is all i'm saying and again i'm not an expert milan is not an expert we don't really even know what qualifies somebody as an expert right is it i've been married and divorced and married and divorced 20 times so i got this or is it you know i've never done i've never sinned against my spouse well i don't think any of us would would fall in that category um it's probably the person we sin against the most to be honest but um that's some tea teases yeah but i was gonna say all of this stuff may sound kind of extreme kind of like weird at first and i don't know i feel like extreme is kind of like the only word i can think of because the world just really doesn't cherish a marriage the way that the bible does and they don't really put that much value in it it's just on to the next kind of like the iphone which is not coming out this year did you know that did you know that's not where i thought you were going to take this but yes you told me that and i'm shook i think the world needs to i think covid needs to stop for a little bit no i'm good with not another iphone out just for a moment of silence we need to just for the iphone not coming out everything else has to be put on hold right no more coved no more anything well related to kovid divorce rates went up by like 700 i think something like that yeah like extreme like it just went through the roof so all this to say is the things that we're gonna be talking about is kind of the boundaries and the guidelines that we have set to keep our marriage sacred and keep it special and the word boundaries always seems like you're being bounded by something and that's not always a bad thing most of the time it's a good thing we've mentioned this many times before but like a quick analogy is like we tell olathe not to run into the street why because she could get hit by a car yeah that's a it's a healthy like yes yeah just like something really it's at the end of the day it's to help sorry the way you're looking at me i'm just i'm giving you those biblical husband eyes when he's trying to like i don't know if you like know that you do this but when you're trying to listen to someone you kind of like go like this but it like looks like you're mad but i know you're not i'm just intense and thought of what you're saying okay sure would you like me to change my face um no it's okay i just it's just okay that's perfect all right disclaimer's out of the way there's something else you said that i wanted to compliment but i'm sure we'll get plenty of that going forward yeah so yeah just so you know there's plenty of other resources out there we're not the end-all be-all or the expert by any means but we do want to share our perspective because we think it might help other people out there regardless of what stage you're in right and that's something i want to address really quickly too because i would say that there's probably three categories of people listening at least to this podcast right now the first category would be people who are seeking who are i would consider single right or maybe dating but still not like fully committed and then the next group of people would be those who are waiting and that's where you are engaged so you've entered into a commitment with this person that you've pledged to get married to one day but you're not married yet and then you have the committed and so i just want to break those down a little bit we're going to be primarily talking about commitment and in marriage within that context because this is a husband and a wife perspective right yeah but i do think it's important that you're talking about the foundations that you're laying prior to getting married because it all uh overflows into the next right and this is something i constantly had to remind myself when we were engaged i remember we were probably like i don't know three months away from being married or something and i had to keep stopping myself because i always say oh once we get married like this won't be an issue we're like oh once we get married like jordan won't do that anymore or once we get married like this problem will go away and that was the opposite the problem got amplified and we got the magnifying glass out and like it was a lot more so all that to say that marriage itself like will not solve your problems yeah you're gonna have more absolutely we thought i mean and don't get me wrong because there were things that marriage made a whole heck of a lot easier for us but i wasn't going to go there but no that's exactly what i was thinking and other things too but just the fact that you're um regardless of what stage you're in here whether you're single engaged or married we hope that there's something here that you can glean some sort of insight from just from our experience or from what we've done wrong and wish we did right or things that we took other people's advice and it worked out well for us and we want to pass that along right so for me when i was in the seeking phase when malay and i were just starting dating she was my first girlfriend i was like 17 when we first met and started dating so i really didn't have a girlfriend before that and you can imagine how much i would have gotten made fun of and i'm not like asking for sympathy i'm just saying that's just the world today is like what you're 17 you never dated anyone what's wrong with you right so i would try to from the very first date i would try to continually put myself in elvis shoes that's malina's father if you don't know elvis yes that's his real name um i would try to put myself in his shoes and be like okay if this were my daughter how would i want some punk 17 year old kid coming around that has an interest in her how would i want him to treat her if i were him but then i was like trying to be him so i'm trying to think how he would want me to you know what i'm saying so that was kind of my uh my my anchor or kind of like my what am i trying to say like my my uh my guide stick in trying to determine my measure my rule of measure i don't know what i'm trying to say i think i'm like i know i'm mixing up different sayings but that was kind of like my standard that i tried to come back to it's like okay he probably wouldn't like me doing this or probably wouldn't like me saying that or he probably wouldn't like me thinking this right right so of course that's just on an earthly perspective but if but then knowing that i answered to god um ultimately that was really my conviction too is like okay i'm gonna be accountable for for these things right i'm going to be accountable for for that but having elvis and having having a person there kind of materialized that for me uh as well as doing doing so with with my spiritual relationship with the lord well just a little side note cute little story when we did go on our first date so i was 15. i wasn't driving and none of my friends were driving yet either and it was kind of like a big deal for me to go in a car with another boy to go on a date like this was the first time that i had really done that um and jordan when he came to pick me up he had like a little card i don't even know if you remember this like a little business card of some sort and you wrote like your number your parents number you like wrote your email like social security my bank accounts do you remember this you like wrote down information like i just wrote my my phone number on it yeah just like in case something happened and if like he like wanted to get in contact with us and like make sure we were okay and take notes all of that it was so cute and of course he opened the door for me which is not open for me since then chivalry has died i'm sorry no it's just we have um these two little bundles of joy now and usually he's holding we'll divide and conquer i put one kid in he puts the other we will touch a little bit on you know biblical relationship as a husband and wife in the context of being parents also a little bit towards the end here but i think didn't want to dwell too much on the singleness factor but i think i think that's a good point too honey is to have like a a standard or something while you're in this seeking phase you know what is your your standard that you're basing your relationships off of are you into more of the courting thing which i don't know i don't really have an opinion one way or another on that or are you more into just regular dating but i would say definitely date somebody with the intention of well will this person one day be my spouse so they have the potential to be my spouse one day right because if you're not if you don't have the end in mind you're gonna waste your time it's just a waste of time and i would argue that that's not a healthy place to be at emotionally and relationally because if you're just dating someone for status or for their looks or for whatever else it might be like there's bonuses there's benefits that come with things but that shouldn't be the central focus on oh i just want somebody to love me oh i just want somebody to to take care of me like there's a difference between you know committing to somebody as your your spouse for for life or just somebody that you want to have fun with right there's a fundamental difference there so have the end in mind for me it was what would i want somebody to treat my daughter if i were in milana's dad's shoes right so next phase is the waiting phase right where you're engaged now i will say this honey what did i get you on thanksgiving i think it was like 20 15 2014. um okay so 2015. no 20 2014. i i can't remember now updates but we were we had been dating for a couple years like two three years and yeah we were still like melania was 15 if you don't know when i was 17 when we started dating so we were in high school we didn't we weren't even in college yet so we're trying to like get a feel for like where's our relationship going and kind of what's the future look like we knew we wanted to get married young given that we met each other so young um but i was 18 i was still in high school jordan had started college i think you were a sophomore in college and we weren't able to get marriage financially like it just like was not gonna be possible i was a full-time student and i i was working at a gym training and working the front desk for like minimum wage but it was still cool because i got a free membership out of it so but it wasn't exactly ideal the uh situation for getting married like so i guess you could sleep on my pecs that were just ridiculously developed we wouldn't need a bed we could just you could just sleep on my chest and we'd be married and it's all good so jordan got me a promise ring and i still have it it's like the cutest thing ever it's like a blue ring i'm actually going to keep it and i want to give it to latia um but no you're not your purity ring i was was getting that confused yes so i did actually have a purity ring before that your parents got that for your 16th right or was it your 15th birthday oh honey i just i can't keep up with the dates i don't know it's it's all a blur it honestly is such a i can't remember what i ate for breakfast let alone what happened almost like eight years ago yeah so because this yeah this is this has been this is our ninth year of knowing each other and like being together and dating so anyway jordan got me a promise ring so it's basically him saying like i'm committed to you i'm gonna marry you just right now the times is not gonna work right and then we we're not of the belief that you should be engaged to somebody for like eight years ten years right yeah and just kind of dragging this thing out especially if you're waiting for marriage that's just not healthy there ought to be a good reason right or at least in our in our hearts and our minds like okay well we just monetarily financially cannot sustain even like put aside like you know spending you know ten thousand dollars or something like that on a wedding or more even i think the average is like forty thousand right now in the us something crazy like that but we didn't even have that let alone to have like like put that aside we wouldn't even have the means to support ourselves like beyond like stand on our own feet and yeah we again again i know there's differing opinions and different perspectives but again just sharing our perspective take it with a grain of salt it was we didn't want to get married and then like live at our parent one of our parents house or live with somebody else i get people do that and there's reasons for that and there's totally justifiable reasons but that wasn't our situation so we said we're going to wait till we can sustain ourselves till one of us graduates naturally that would have been me since i'm two years older and two grades ahead so i have yet to graduate um malena we're still praying for have not given up but no so god's blessed us with with other opportunities um outside of that but that was our plan originally right was to graduate and i did and i got my degree and started working and then you know different opportunities opened up so on and so forth but the point is that i had an income there to sustain and that was what for us what we deemed was the wisest decision to make to wait till we like finished and got a job and got out into the real world kind of thing so the reason i bring all that up is because a promise ring is a great idea if you're kind of in this phase where okay we've been dating for a good amount of time we're not exactly at the place to get engaged and planning a wedding and planning you know for marriage but this kind of is like a micro step along the way that helps you kind of like ease into the idea of forever right yeah so for me i'm not like intimidated by commitment or afraid of commitment i just wanted to make sure that we were taking our time with things so uh engagement when you're kind of past that idea of the promise ring like i think it was a year or something like that that we were i gave you the promise ring before we actually proposed an official engagement all that so it's kind of like a good intermediary step but once you get to the engagement phase i would say and even before but especially in engagement is a great time to take pre-marriage classes at your church uh we can go on and on and we've talked about this we have a whole episode on this actually yeah but we cannot recommend that enough you just learn so much about your spouse and even about yourself more so just yourself because it's really hard for you to like love on someone else if you can't love on yourself and you don't know enough about yourself because we are all the way that we were raised is so important and so important into what you will bring into your marriage something as simple as like who's gonna take out the trash who is going to do the dishwashers like like all that like we talked through all of that in our pre-marriage class yeah and i feel like it helped and saved so many fights and arguments that we didn't end up having we've had plenty of other fights in argus yes of course absolutely just not over who puts out the trash a lot of them were diffused and deflected right i know my role i'm the garbage man so yes that's a i think i can't emphasize that enough is to take those pre-marriage classes work out the kinks before you get to the altar not saying you're not everything's gonna be perfect in peachy keen because like melania said already marriage will have its own set of things and amplifying issues but the more fires you can extinguish earlier on and more preventative maintenance rather than uh you know just kind of letting things fester and then all of a sudden they you know volcano erupts when you're married that's that's the time to do it so it's all about being proactive getting ahead of the curve that kind of thing right uh with with your relationship so great time to do that is when you're in this waiting or engaged phase it's also a great time to get out any deep dark secrets that your future spouse should know like i don't know if you have millions of dollars of debt or maybe long lost oh i thought you were gonna say like millions of dollars not like that like you got some crazy you're like yeah that would be a nice surprise or you have like some my strange addiction like you like eating the foam and couches or something like that that's probably something you should tell your future spouse that way they can buy discounted furniture the budget can go to other things like actual food but i digress so yeah i'm joking but obviously obviously but having these deeper conversations um you'd be surprised if like people say oh i was you know i dated so and so for five years and then when we got engaged and all of a sudden like they spilled their guts and we get messages like this all the time too from supporters and followers i'm pretty sure when in our pre-marriage class we had a day dedicated to doing that right yeah it sounds about right they like prepped us for it for it and like really helped us with what to do and how to do it and then what to do afterwards and that was nice yeah so it's very therapeutic and it's definitely something you don't want to wait till after you're married so one more thing in this waiting engagement phase i would say is to learn and not just learn but master each other's love languages yes and but that goes for both what your future spouse likes to receive and also learn what you like to receive yourself and what you like to give i think you have to do it both ways like so there's four there's what your spouse likes to give and what your spouse likes to receive there's like there's what you like to give and what you like to receive yes yes and if you don't know what your love language are is just do a quick google search there's also a book too it's called five lovely five level languages by gary chapman yeah it's a really popular book but um it's it's definitely very resourceful and useful for any relationship not necessarily like husband and wife but any type of relationship um i've like been meaning to tell you this but i think mine has changed recently so we need to sit down and have that conversation interesting spill the t sis i don't yeah we'll talk about it later but mine has definitely changed i feel like since having kids it's changed interesting and i feel like you've noticed that too i feel like i should have noticed but you can't read my mind here hello i'm not that good of a husband   he hasn't reached the expertise level of mind reading yet so we can't speak on marriage moving on to the committed phase which is now you're married and notice it's the only one in the past tense because it's a it's a defining moment in time right like you're seeking and that's a ongoing continual thing and then you're waiting right and that's that's an ongoing thing too but that also has a limit to it once that you cross over that line of now you're committed that's it you're together till death do you part and for those of us who are in christ we know that death is not the end so i'm not gonna go until like the whole i don't think we're married in heaven um i think there's that's that's a rabbit hole i don't want to go down but we are you know united in christ so um but i think when we go to the altar and we say our vows that is to remind us of that commitment that we made right that's a promise that's a sacred covenant before god and to your point what you were saying earlier honey about you know the world will kind of take this idea of marriage and just see it as maybe something for convenience for tax purposes or hey we might as well get married because we really like each other but or might as well not get married yeah but understanding that marriage is a sacred institution that god himself ordained between a man and a woman that they too should become one flesh the man should leave his father and mother it should be joined to his wife and they will become one flesh right so you're becoming one together right it's not something that we haphazardly enter into just kind of it's nonchalant whatever right it's something that you're pledging your love and your commitment to this person before god and before other people so that is the committed phase and that's what we're going to be talking about on this episode forthcoming for the the next remainder of this of the show but that is something that we see god creating in adam and eve in the very beginning in genesis and then we also see jesus affirming this union of man and wife in the gospels in matthew right he says from the beginning god made them male and female but not what god has joined together man tear apart right so saying this is a biblical institution that's so i think we often forget and the reason i'm bringing that up is because a lot of us might see that as um it's lost it's sacred secrets say sacredness sanctity i don't know i don't know if that's right usage but it's been desacralized so we need to remember that this is something that god has ordained yeah you good you got any of the points you want to say all right so we're going to share a couple of things that i think from a biblical husband's perspective that we've kind of prefaced the different stages and kind of where we're going to be talking about wanted to share a little bit of insight and and things that we've learned from the perspective of a biblical husband and wife marriage so as melania mentioned at the beginning of the show she did a video on being a christian wife and with that pulled out some biblical principles some advice that she had learned along the way and just just seeing what does it look like to follow jesus in my role as a wife right and a lot of people said they would want to hear from the husband's perspective so little majority over here here i am and i would like to um in all my glory and uh i would like to just kind of highlight and and and honor some of the things that molina said as well as adding you know my two cents to to some of that as well so if you recall from that video uh melano talks about wives ought to respect their husbands and this this is from ephesians 5. and additionally husbands ought to love their wives in the same way that christ loved the church and be willing to give up their lives right so jesus did he gave up his life for the church and husbands and so paul saying in that same capacity husbands you ought to be sacrificing yourselves and giving of yourselves for your wife and i think that that is that hits me right between the eyes because i know what it means to be sacrificing or at least willing to sacrifice um back when i was a special agent with the secret service we had a lot of training in protection and protecting people of all different political affiliations whether they were from overseas or they're local here if they're on one side of the political spectrum versus another didn't matter we had a job to do and every single person was willing to take a bullet for that person so to be selfless and to be self-sacrificing is to put yourself out of the way and say look there's something greater here there's some there's a bigger mission here than just me and i need to come to terms with that and then get on board with that right so the same thing applies in our marriage because we have a husband and a wife and a lot of times people think like well why is why is husband considered above the wife or the head of the household i didn't know you were gonna get into this well no this is what that's what we're talking about with respecting and leading right and what a lot of people i think in our culture today don't understand is we have you know differing opinions and different ideologies out there that say woman should do every single thing that a man should do and vice versa right like basically the two should be completely interchangeable but the reality is we're not god has created us each specifically with certain roles and responsibilities and capabilities that the other one doesn't have but we're meant to complement one another and you were talking about this too you kind of had like a revelation you're talking about a couple weeks ago because i always get upset at jordan i'm like dude why can't you just like be a mom like why can't you just like do the things that i like quickly can just do not saying that he can't but like to him it doesn't come as naturally as it does for me and i was it's funny because we actually were coming down the stairs and i was like oh it's because god didn't make him that way it reminds me of sebastian maniscalco the community's a little bit raunchy but he's funny because he's italian and we can relate to a lot of the stuff he says he was like talking about his wife he's like i would breastfeed if i could you know that you know exactly like i can't breastfeed i don't know i'm not wired that way if i could i would but i can't you know yeah i don't know maybe it's like not something that people like have ever had to deal with but for me i always find myself getting frustrated and thinking like why can't he just like do what i do i'm like because he's not meant to do that he's doing other things that he can well capably do that i don't do or doesn't come naturally to me and i need to give him a little more slack and patience that's where i'm working on and there are tons of great resources on the different roles that god has given us as husband and wife that are equal but completely different right so one's not better than the other it's just that they have different roles in any society or any you know position of of order in in the world that you have this you have some people that do this some people do that they're different but they're one's not better than the other or at least in god's economy they aren't right right yeah so the world might say well if you're a boss then you're above and you're over everyone else but that's not true in god's economy if you're in one position of leadership what does it mean to lead a lot of us think we we have this negative connotation with leadership because we think of it as oh you boss coming around you know they're telling me what to do they think they're better than me they have no power in their life at home so they got to come to work and you know that's their outlet to like lord it over everybody or you know something like that and there's like a negative connotation with this but in the way that the bible frames leadership for the husband is to be sacrificing to be a servant leader right to be willing to risk and give up his life to make sure that his wife and his family are provided for and taken care of us like let's tell elena before we sat down to record if if we were at the point where we couldn't afford a meal between to feed you me and our children i would be the one to go hungry so that you guys could eat right it's for the betterment of the rest of the family so actually to lead means to put to elevate your wife and your children even and put that and regard them as better than yourself and more important than yourself so again with the secret service background there we have you know the same same mindset there that you're trained to put others before yourself i think there's a lot of spiritual and theological implement implication there so that's what i've tried to carry over in my my personal life as well yeah well you're supposed to be saying that you love your wife right that was like the whole point of this yes point one yes i think sure the long oh spiel what longo   well before moving on i feel like it would be important to mention pornography because along with loving your spouse and loving your wife comes respecting your wife how do you have that face again sorry i'm just deep thought and pornography is definitely something that i see a lot of you messaging me about and saying that like that's something your husband struggles with or like you saw in your bank statements that your husband got a fans only account or follows a ton of like half naked women on instagram and um that is definitely not okay especially in the context of marriage i mean it's it's never okay but even more so when you're married and committed to someone that's not something that you should be doing i think it's hard to frame like human sexuality and put putting like we talked about earlier boundaries on it if you're not operating from a biblical worldview and then there are still like you said even those who would say you know oh i'll watch pornography with my spouse you know and the problem with that is you are bringing in something and actually john piper uh has a has a lot of great material and resources on uh the destructiveness of pornography in a marriage and in in just a relationship regardless of where you're at but and just in general too there's many studies on how unproductive it there was like a study i saw a long time ago that there was this guy that stopped masturbating for a full month he was able to start a business he had that sounds funny but i believe i know i know he started a business he had like so many extra hours of his day he found himself out of depression he became um it was like a whole thing i'll try to find the article and link it down below but is it ironic that something that's supposed to make you feel good or bringing pleasure ends up robbing you of true pleasure amen sis bro but that's the thing is um like john piper has a lot of good resources but when you bring that into your marriage you are now um involving the imagination and uh something that could be fantasy with reality right and it doesn't mean you can't have a great sex life or with your spouse but what it does mean is there's almost that's almost like the easy way out or like the cop-out way of like oh i don't want to put in the effort or put in the work because guys marriage is work marriage is is a lot of toiling and a lot of hard trust me i know no i'm just kidding but no there's definitely a sense of you're you know you're working and commitment takes re-commitment it's not just a one-time thing at the altar you're continually saying i do to your spouse right just like when you are saved and you are now a follower of jesus and god's forever family that was a moment in time that you were saved and now you're being saved in the process of sanctification where you're going back to that you're preaching the gospel to yourself you're reminding yourself no i'm not like i used to be no i am saved i'm being sanctified and being made new in christ right so it's it's a one-time event where you're now sealed just like marriage and your salvation but then it's a continual dying to yourself or dying to other other things outside of that relationship right it goes back to the boundaries that you were talking about healthy boundaries to thrive right so yeah i think that's a great point jeremy and audrey oh yeah so jeremy referring to yes so jeremy and audrey roloff we talk about them so much but they did a blog post a long time ago on their beating 50 account and pornography is something that jeremy has struggled with in their marriage and they've done a couple of blog posts on this and i found it very insightful so i will link that down below um for some of you guys if that's something that you'd be interested because to be honest that's not something that we've had to deal with in our marriage so far and thank god because jordan would be a dead man um i would be dead and probably castrated yes every time i cook and i'm cutting something i'm like honey do you see this stop actually she's not flying but um moving on from that just a smooth segway here uh there's something else melania said in her video was to communicate your feelings to your spouse and i would just want to underscore and parrot and re reverberate that because communicating constantly is so key and maybe you want to take your own advice honey because uh the little things and really there's no such thing as little things right like little things that tick you off or that you get offended by or upset about they turn into the big things right yeah so if you don't put out the fire the little spark initially that can turn into a forest fire eventually and something that's not helpful to say in an argument is oh well that's not a big deal or oh i didn't think that was do i do that i do that yeah you do but i do it to you too we both do that minimizing the other person's yes i didn't mean to like something throw that at you and like say that you do that but i just wanted it's fine you meant that i was just emphasizing your point of nothing is like too little so to me something might be a really big deal but to you you're like what is wrong with this girl and same to you you know like i see yeah validating a person's feelings regardless of how you think they should feel right and there's definitely time and place to be like hey like maybe not in the moment like melania said but there's there's a right time and place for you to be like hey honey i feel like you were overreacting in that situation or don't say that in the moment not in the moment right when they're cooled off a couple days later yeah when we were interviewing people like suspects um on cases i would be like uh yeah we need a little cooling off period here until they can kind of calm themselves down and then go in and you're like hey man like let's you know it's good to have that cooling off period just part of a natural human reaction to kind of get really yeah up and tight about certain things in the moment and then later you have a little bit different perspective a little bit clarity yeah like someone we know in our family they're like yeah i was totally wrong about that i let my emotions get the best of me and i'm sorry i shouldn't have done that and now i feel foolish right so we're trying to limit the amount of bandaging you have to do later after the fact exactly so yeah but there's a time and place to to do that even if you think that they're overreacting or that they're wrong or they're making it a big deal don't do that in the moment wait till five minutes later five years later i don't know something like that somewhere in there but generally speaking yeah five minutes to five years that's probably a good gauge somewhere around there yeah uh the next thing i kind of already talked about a little bit but i just want to further emphasize this idea of learning to lead because we see a lot of men especially in our culture that are completely fine with like taking the back seat and i'm all for like women like the rosie the riveter if you're not in america you might not know what that means but rosie the river rosie the riveter was this iconic um like image of a woman during world war ii during like the 1940s yeah she's rolling up her sleeves and she's you know like basically that was symbolizing how the glorified you know housewife of the mid-century you know would take care of the family she'd run a tight ship she'd cook clean kids you know everything and then the husband would be out working right that's kind of like the the old-fashioned traditional picture of a family right in the united states then when world war ii hit and all the men were going to uh off to war to fight overseas the factories and the jobs that the men were working at were now vacant and left open so they still wanted to make things go and put and produce things so life could still function back at home so but who's going to do that and that's when the woman said okay we're going to roll up our sleeves we're going to go learn these things that we've never done before be placed in these positions and they knocked out of the park and things were booming and the industry was going well right this was after the great depression like things are now picking back up a lot of that is the woman's contribution so reason i preface that is because we are created again as men to have certain roles where that we are serving and leading and i see a lot of men today and i live in a glass house i can't throw stones not fulfilling their god-given duty to lead and lead well and when you say lead what aspects um i think it'd be helpful for me to say more what i'm not talking about so oh by leading it's i'm not talking about you have to be the one working and your spouse isn't allowed to work yeah that's a good idea um i'm not saying you have to make more money than your spouse if your spouse does work and i'm not shaming anybody who would rather not work as a as a wife but i think if if it comes down to it between the husband and the wife the husband should just should at least be instinctually wanting to provide in some capacity so for example i'm sure this is probably going to offend people but i'm just sharing i'm just sharing my perspective here this is you know take or leave it again my two cents if a woman is making you know has a great job is enjoys what she's doing and she's working and all of a sudden they have children and say the husband's like i don't really you know i just kind of do my job to pay the bills or whatever just to supplement but really my wife's the one that's like knocking out of the park and she loves it and you guys take off some time to you know raise a family i'm fine with a dad staying home and being a stay-at-home dad why is that all of a sudden something too oh yeah i don't know why would that be controversial well because some people might have this idea of well the man has to be working and the wife so want to stay home with the kids and maybe it may be an art i agree with that maybe in our progressive culture that's getting more uh more accepted stay at home dads yeah but at the same time i'm not just saying stay at home just to stay at home and like sit on the couch and and watch football all day right that's there's a difference because you're now having an active part in raising your next generation which is the and some biggest job you'll ever have right so i would think it would be foolish actually to then say to your spouse you need to quit your job and stay at home or you need to go on maternity leave and and and again there's a reason why is because women are the ones bearing the children so their bodies are going through all these you know changes and difficulties and struggles and after birth right like you know that better than i do obviously so there's a reason why like they build in maternity leave which should be a lot longer than what it is in the us sucks at this well there's other provisions but i would say from a the father's standpoint or or the husband there's a little bit more uh i think it's becoming it's slowly starting to become a little bit more accepted of like hey if you want to as the dad want to stay home for you know 12 weeks or 16 weeks and take like a paternity leave yes that's all for that that's cool too right yeah so or it comes down to the fact of hey the dad's just gonna quit work and he's gonna stay home and help the children right there's a physical dependence like with breastfeeding or or whatever if you decide to go that route i'm really having to like walk on eggshells i know i'm trying please hear my heart in this i'm not trying to be insensitive or or completely like blanket over certain things but i am trying to just convey a principle here and that is the the role for husband and wife isn't what society has painted them or boxed them into but if you look at through a biblical perspective you always see the husband and the father giving of himself pouring himself out whether that's toiling working or raising his children to know the lord or to be the prophet and the priest of his home teaching them that's the scripture that's what i was gonna say when i like asked you like what do you meant by leading what i was trying to get at was like you're the household um like the spiritual leader of our household sure and right as you say that there might be people thinking well what the wife can't do that the mother can't no she is but she's also again as you mentioned in your video submit submitting herself again it's not the husband forcing her to submit it's her out of her own choosing submitting herself to her husband's leadership so it's a complimentary thing it's not a one the wife is submitting and choosing to put herself under her husband and her husband is also choosing to serve his wife and to give himself up so it's this mutual uh mutual submission back and forth to one another in a separate but equal role yes and then when you had children in the mix you're both leading your children now but i'm gonna actually get into that in a minute but go ahead um i did want to kind of put a nail in this last statement with this quote that i absolutely love dad things put a nail on it this is what i wanted to end with on that point of servant leadership in in the roles yeah um quote from matthew henry who wrote an entire commentary on the bible we've shared this before but i think it's it's worth um reiterating he's he wrote his commentary on the creation of eve from adam when god created man and woman and he says this eve was not taken from adam's head to top him nor his feet to be trampled on by him but out of his side to be equal with him under his arm to be protected by him and near his heart to be loved by him and i think that imagery is all the feels just that insight that he has is profound i think it's so true uh and it just gives you a lot of perspective there on the creation and roles and purposes for husband and wife it's not not to lord some sort of you know dominance over him over her or to you know abuse that which i think with with our world in secular society has twisted that good biblical truth into something that it's not yeah to now make people think oh the bible's you know misogynist or whatever you know it's just it's not true couldn't be farther from the truth and in fact it's actually the opposite you see the bible giving extreme privilege to women in their stories and and their figures that the old world would have never you know counted a woman's word in the court in a a court of law right so i decorate i was gonna say i'm bringing you back in next thing i want to mention uh that i think is key is to date your wife and this is something your boy uh definitely does struggle at but it's not intentional obviously like i want to date milan it's not like i'm like oh i gotta go on a date you know and this could look like so many different things it doesn't have to be like dinner and a movie you can covet definitely made us explore that we have a whole episode on how to date your spouse mm-hmm during yeah that doesn't require spending money it's more so it's it's not so much a thing you do but a a position position of your heart right yeah like if your if your desires to be intentional in serving and loving your spouse you'll find creative ways to do that yeah you don't necessarily have to break the bank like we have a book called 10 dates it's just like simple things it's all about building quality time which is one of the love languages when you're dating somebody or or dating your spouse you're spending that quality time together and with little kids and working from home and being gone at work and coming you know back and forth back and forth yeah sometimes malay and i feel like just two ships passing each other in the night we're just like roommates yeah so we know it's only for a season at times um so we're nevertheless that's not an excuse we're still looking for ways to uh creatively date one another and i'll just say this i i set the bar way too high at the very beginning with all this where i just knocked it out of the park with our first dates and now i got like nothing to live up to so you know uh oh you don't agree all right then well that's awkward but no in all seriousness as i'm thinking about things to be strategic like your wife is gonna love seeing that because what that's communicating to your wife is wow he cares like he wants to play like despite the buzziness like he still wants to spend time with me exactly exactly and i will say this too is talking about you know being ships passing in the night and having children and other things going on do not do not do not do not do not let your children replace your spouse now your children are just as important but there must be an order of relationship for good reasons right you do not vow to your children you vow to your spouse before the lord not your children god your spouse and your children because if one is off then the others can't thrive right it's it's i use the analogy of when you get on an airplane and they tell you you know uh in the case of you know loss of oxygen the masks will drop secure your own mask before assisting others right i always think like that's kind of foolish like why would you not help the little kids first you know but then it makes sense that if you're incapacitated you can't even help the person who doesn't even have a chance on their own right so you do yours first you make sure you get that on real quick and now you can help other people same thing in our relationships like i can't be a good dad to alathia and ari if i'm out of sync with elena in our in our walk and i can't be a honorable husband that's serving melana and leading her and loving her appropriately if my relationship with god is out of sync right so all connected it's all an overflow in a position in a specific ordering right yeah so just being constantly and and communion with god with your spouse and with your children to kind of ask the question that god first asked man back in the garden after they sinned is where are you right that implication is where's your heart god knew of course where adam and eve were hiding but he was asking them do you know what's happened do you know where your heart is what is where are you right like where are you at you know it's kind of like in the military they say hey check on your buddy you're good kind of thing like with all the suicide that happens and and just the hell that war is that people experience and then they come back and they try to assimilate to like natural life and nobody can understand or comprehend what they went through they just see no other way out sometimes and again it's hard for people to understand like why you got so much to live for right and a lot of people don't don't see it that way so you have to be you know check on people check on yourself are you good you know yeah as we wrap it up here a couple more like just practical things that i think would be helpful coming from a place in biblical biblically rooted but not necessarily like uh relational advice i would just say to set boundaries with parents and in-laws when you guys get married but also be sympathetic to them because their lives are transitioning and the the chapter is flipping for them too yeah i feel like for us this so jordan and i both went from living with our parents to living with each other so like we both went to schools that were a commute like 30 minutes away from home so we didn't have to drive super far we didn't have to live on a campus we never did like the whole roommate thing so for our parents i feel like it was a big jump because it was like suddenly like i have my kids in my home to like they're suddenly gone like they didn't really get to like transition from that but not only are they gone but now they're married especially if it's the first kid right yeah and we which we wear for both of the families yep so it was a new thing so just kind of giving them grace and being like hey we love you we want to see you but we don't want to spend every single day with you we need to have our own maybe you do want to spend all this time with them but you also realize that you need to build your relationship with your new spouse right so having these boundaries and there's a loving way to do it that maybe your parents don't even realize like oh well i just i'm sorry i'm getting used to this also that's fine you know so uh the other thing i wanted to touch on that i don't think would be complete without mentioning is when it comes to the realm of finances um i'm gonna actually defer to dave ramsey on on all things financial because we just try to follow as closely as possible his jordan watches him every day you guys see this every morning is not complete without jordan's big old cup of joe and good old uncle dave on the tv that's right so i really like listening to dave and chris hogan who's another one of his uh co-hosts but uh just fall like you could just look them up on youtube they got a podcast whatever um but one thing in in light of kind of marriage and stepping into this new relationship as a husband you do not want to combine your finances until you're married obviously for legal reasons and if things happen and you know it could get ugly with you know lawyers involved and you know this that and the other thing and it just gets messy so yeah wait till you're married but then after you are married absolutely do combine your finances come buying your bank accounts don't have like his and hers i know some people do that and i would just say again my advice take it with a grain of salt uh it's better to not have the disposition for you know money yeah then it's mine versus hers and it goes entitlement well it goes back secrets and all that becoming one exactly like thank you big root cause you're becoming one your bank accounts are becoming one as well that's exactly right so yeah that's just a little quick fire at the end good job honey thank you you did great you too you didn't do that many tangents you kept me on track before melania flipped the camera on she grabbed me by the collar listen if you go on more than two tangents she didn't finish the thread that was enough for me to soil my pants jordan threw in oh wait hold on i don't know if you guys also caught what jordan threw out there about his previous job we'll see how well y'all are listening oh yeah i was like it's probably time i i know i mentioned something because everyone was like the number one question is always what jordan i'm not i'm no longer i'm no longer with the secret service i have since but you guys can understand why we couldn't be able to say it in the name of secret service for a reason right right so yeah i'm still working i have another job but which i'm not going to talk about which is also a secret but i'm no longer with the secret service so that secret is no longer a secret secret fabulous yeah that's kind of uh that's kind of it we do have a prayer request it's actually they didn't request that we pray for them but they just wanted to share uh the impact that the podcast has made on their lives and their decision to sponsor a child so this comes from yasmine and or yasmin sorry if i'm mispronouncing that but we want to honor you and just thank god for you and for your obedience uh to stepping out in faith uh she just recently started sponsoring a little boy named james from tanzania and so honey if i can defer to you and impose on you too pray for that whole thing going on with yasmin and james and all that um i just did want to make a quick announcement about the money that we are raising for children in tanzania so i'm gonna we're gonna have to go and email them but i just wanted to say that if you were not able to donate make sure to go back and watch like basically any of my videos because i'm donating all of my adsense so if you guys just want to like if you're not in the position to donate like put on a video and like have it play in the background or something you don't have to like sit there and watch like i wouldn't make that wouldn't make you do that but um all the ads are going to tanzania so i just want to throw that out there and we're also still trying to hit our goal of 1.1 million um people been asking for an update we don't have a an official update for you yet but you guys are doing great um i know we're we're definitely in at least five figures maybe coming close to six figure yeah amounts so still some ways to go but we are asking that you would again we don't get anything from it um any any personal gain from it other than seeing god's kingdom come to earth and to help rescuing children from poverty um this is also not sponsored but our friends jess and gabriel uh conti you might know them they have like over three million subscribers on youtube maybe maybe don't i don't know if you've been living under a rock or something maybe but um but they just uh launched uh more so gabriel and his brother claudio just launched grace coffee company and they are partnered with compassion as well so they'll help uh release children from poverty in jesus name with your coffee purchase and you can also subscribe so you get your coffee every month and your child's life you're continuing to support children being rescued from poverty so yeah go check them out grace coffee co we'll put a link in our description um and their coffee is really good it is actually really good no we're not just saying that because i've tasted a lot of drip coffee that tastes like it's been burnt or very bitter and this stuff like watered like poop water yeah no this is like very good you could tell they put their research into like and gabe is like very particular about it yeah they're coffee connoisseurs so they made sure it was like a good quality product and also for even if it was crappy coffee i would still sponsor them i would still i would still support

all right love you guys hey guys welcome it's my channel or welcome back today's video we are going to be talking about toddler tantrums if you have a child you know how difficult it is to deal with them once they start entering that stage where they have tantrums over everything and i mean everything at least you'll be like i want to go outside we go outside i want to go inside like literally over every little thing and when alexia first started having tantrums and okay oh quickly i'll just share stories so we were actually it was right after quarantine had ended so restaurants were open because i think it was one of the first times we went out to eat as a family after everything happened and we went and she was crying and screaming and throwing herself on the ground and it was like this huge fast go and i had no idea what to do i was like do i yell at her do i not doing anything do i pick her up like what do i do i was so confused and it was so embarrassing because this restaurant was so small and everyone was looking at me and i'm like i was like speechless i was like i don't know what to do so after that i was like i need to get my stuff together i found a couple of instagram accounts i found a couple of books um i went back and looked at like my old um notes from when i was in college and i really wanted to kind of educate myself and kind of figure out okay what am i going to do about these tantrums because they happen and they happen frequently but how am i going to go about doing that and gentle discipline and gentle parenting has been the route that i would like to go down um there's just a lot of data and a lot of evidence of how this works really well and how other other ways of dealing with it such as time out and spanking and talking back and yelling all of that isn't really as effective so to me this seemed like the best route so i am going to take you guys kind of along and show you guys what it is that i do now i'm not an expert at this at all um alecia is 19 months and i'd say she started having tantrums when she was probably like 13 months is when it like kind of started to happen so it's not like i have 15 kids and have all this experience all this i definitely don't but i have noticed that this works really well i'm gonna kind of walk through those things i have a ton of notes i'm gonna share with you guys and i want this to be very informal or not informal i want this to be very informative and helpful and i also want to kind of like give you guys really good tips so what i'm gonna kind of go through is first the preventative stuff that i do to stop the tantrums from even happening and then i'll share with you guys what i do once they do happen and i did get one video of this in action because i think it's really helpful because it's one thing to like watch a video and see someone do it and like okay great and then never actually see it in action because when it's an action i feel like that's when it's the most helpful so hope you guys enjoyed this video it was highly requested i actually did another video very similar to this and it was titled parenting styles i don't subscribe to and a lot of you really enjoyed that video so this is kind of going along with that because this is not very traditional things um that people do and i just want to share with you guys and a lot of you seemed really interested in this so give this video a thumbs up if you guys want me to continue more of the parenting and toddler-ish style videos and i'd love to do that and let's go ahead and get started the best thing about being a parent in 2020 oh wait actually did i even talk about my background today do you guys like this are we liking the whole setup are we liking the audio the lighting does it look like there's a tree growing from my head i don't know you let me know i had it off center because i was like oh i look like medusa but then when it was off centered it looked like the entire frame was off-centered so i don't know give me your feedback let me know what you guys think um but the best thing about being a parent in 2020 is that there is so much research so much data so many blogs so many instagram accounts so many therapists so many youtube videos there's a lot of resource and data that we can easily just like have at our fingertips so to me like any time i do something or explain something to my mom she's like wow i wish i would have had that when i was like like when i had you and you were young same with my aunt they're both like wow i wish we would have these resources because it's a blessing that we have that so first and foremost i follow a lot of accounts on instagram and the reason for that uh well specifically like toddler ones my favorite one absolute favorite is big little feelings and i love the handle of that because they're saying that these are big little feelings that our kids are having so i always say that a lathe is having big feelings instead of saying she's having a tantrum or instead of saying that she's being a brat or being dramatic i always just say that she's having big feelings and so that's one of my favorite accounts a lot of what i'm going to talk about i got from them um i'll list a couple of other ones that i really like too there's other child specialists and child therapists and other things that i follow that have really helpful information another thing is books there are wonderful books this one right here is a perfect beginner book it's called gentle discipline using emotional connection not punishment to raise confident capable kids and i really enjoyed this book the reason why i really like it is because it's the perfect beginner's book like if you aren't very familiar with child development and child education and like those things of like what's going on in your little one's brain this kind of gives you that background information and kind of holds your hand through the steps so i really really recommend this um and this is actually the only parenting book i have bought a lot of the other stuff i have for my notes which i'm not going to share with you guys because i can't even read some of them because they're all scribbled and not very well organized so um i did go to school for early childhood education although i did not finish my degree i have six months left which i'm not gonna finish but i learned a lot of the stuff in the classroom too when we think of discipline well at least when i think of discipline i'm like what does that even mean like does that mean putting your kid in time out does that mean speaking like what is discipline it's basically teaching and learning and discipline doesn't start like once they have their first tantrum you're disciplining your child from the moment they're born because they're learning from you and you are the best teacher and best model for your kid your kids learn from you all day long i've had many of you message me before saying like i'm a stay-at-home mom and i feel like i'm not helping my kid and like how do i get them to do this or like how am i able to do this and i'm like dude you that's it like you just being there and you just you just doing your life in front of your kid is teaching them so a lot of this is kind of with you in the child and i know it can seem a little bit overwhelming and a little bit like i don't know what to do because if you have the tendency to screen your child most likely will have the tendency to scream if you tend to hit your child will tend to hit because they're modeling what you do so if you and your husband frequently get in arguments and start screaming and throwing things across the room your child is going to model that as well so keep in mind that what you do and what you display for your child is most likely what they will do as well because that's what they see and that's what they think is right or what they think is what they should be doing so definitely requires a lot of patience on our end definitely requires us to be the adult definitely requires us to reflect on us and what we're doing which can be really challenging sometimes because trust me i lose my ish okay i do but i try my best to keep it cool to give olathe the best example that i can tamper tantrums are a hundred percent normal i know kind of sucks but it's normal it's a normal thing that our kids will do it's a normal thing and to think that they won't have tantrums or to think that what they're doing is bad is just not it's not isn't that it's not going to end well because you're going to be disappointed every single day when the tantrum comes whenever it does come um we adults also have tantrums and our tantrums might not look exactly like theirs where we're throwing ourselves on the ground because we couldn't find the pink pencil i don't know maybe some of you do that but we do definitely throw tantrums if there's moments where you get frustrated fed up or you like freak out or whatever i mean if you don't think we have tantrums go on facebook for a second and just scroll through and you'll find plenty of tantrums from adults but we all have tantrums and we just look a little bit different so we can't expect our kids to like not have tantrums or not know how to deal with them when it's something that we still don't really know how to do so that's kind of like what i want to go into this thinking of kind of how i want to like lay the foundation of the rest of this so let's talk preventative because preventative is the best thing what's better than a tantrum than a tantrum that doesn't happen because we took some good precautionary steps to kind of stop it from happening or kind of delay it so first and foremost feed your kid give them water are they napped little things like that for kids make such a big difference i do follow a pretty strict schedule with alethia and i don't interfere with it like her nap schedule when she's napping i am stuck at home i'm doing what i need to do i don't mess with her nep schedule her nap schedule because when i do she's tired and when she's tired she's crabby just like all of us she's she needs her rest kids need to rest so if she's not well rested then it is i am asking for some bad stuff to happen so make sure they're fed make sure their water is good make sure their diapers are changed make sure they're well napped little basic things like this will help your kid just overall be in a better mood and just a better kid to be around i don't know aren't we all like when i'm hungry i am not in the mood to talk like at all so think of it like yourself like always put yourself in your kid's shoe that's like one thing i constantly do it's like how did i feel at this age because i don't know about you but i have a really good memory of my childhood and i remember specific things that really kicked me off so i make sure not to do that to alathia hello i didn't like it so why would she like it basic needs are they being met number two is to communicate everything and i mean everything and you might think like my kid doesn't understand me yes they do ma'am they do understand you and when i mean communicate like our kids aren't well aware of like what day it is like they don't know that we go to church on sundays like they don't know that tuesday's a swim class so i make sure to communicate and over communicate and let her know what's going on kids thrive on a schedule and do really well on a schedule but the second that schedule gets interrupted with something they're like well mom this is not what we normally do i'm not i'm not too happy about change i'm not too happy i don't know what's going on they feel like they lose a sense of control so communicating everything is key let them know who's coming over today who's going to watch you today we're going to go to this place today we're going to do this this weekend so and so is coming over we are gonna have this for dinner communicate everything so they and they can understand and have an idea of what's going on in their lives the third thing that is really helpful in preventing the tantrums is to give your kid control now can you imagine and i mean this might be true i'm not sure but if you guys have like kept up with the whole britney spears thing and what's going on in her life right now um from what i've seen like she can't even go to starbucks by herself she's a full-grown adult and can't do things on her own and you can you put can you imagine how frustrating that must be that's the same thing with our kids we tell them when to wake up what to eat when to eat what to wear what to play with who to hang out with we control every aspect of our kids lives and they want some sense of control they want some autonomy they want to be able to do their own thing so giving them things that they can have control over will be so helpful because it'll give them the confidence give them the boost to be themselves so really easy example i keep alathia's snacks at a reachable height i keep her plates bowls cups spoons forks everything at a reachable height everything that is hers she can reach so she feels or well not that she feels but she is independent and able to get her own things when she wants so if you follow me on instagram this morning i posted a thing where i was sitting here actually taking notes for this video she came over she brought me a pretzel she said a snack and then she went i was like okay yeah you can get a snack can you get a plate or a bowl she went over there grabbed a pit in a bowl brought it to me and i put her snack in her plate and she was happy as could be and was walking around with pretzels falling all over the ground because she chose a plate but nonetheless so little things like that toys all of her toys okay sorry we have a new guest mr ari got a little bit hungry um okay so like i was saying everything is reachable all of her toys all the toys downstairs are in an area where she can see and grab her own toys can be independent pick what toys she wants to play when she wants to play with them this is another big reason why i just love montessori in her playroom all of her toys are displayed so she can go and pick out which choice she wants so she has sense of control over what she's doing and not feeling like i dictate her every move um same with her clothes every morning i pick out two outfits i know this is a montessori montessori normally has them pick out their own but i normally just pick out two outfits ask her which one she wants ask her which bow she wants to wear what shoes she wants to wear like little things like that throughout the day that give her control and give her sense of independency that will make her make her have control over herself you know like like i said it can be a little bit too much to have someone dictating your every single move next thing has changed my life if you don't get anything out of this video this is what i hope that you do and that is a timer this is something i learned from big little feelings and it like i said it's changed everything for us so what i just basically do is on my phone i will put a timer so i give her a timer for everything and i mean everything if you've ever been around me all of my family always sees me doing this all the time but anytime there's going to be a change in what we're doing a change in where we're going or a change of literally anything i will give her a warning or a timer so for example if she's upstairs playing in her playroom quietly i'll let her know alathia we're going to go to the store in five minutes you have five minutes to wrap up what you're playing with we can leave it exactly as it is so when we come back you can play with it but we're gonna go to the store in five minutes and then i'll pull up my timer and she loves to press the start button and then the timer will start and then i'll keep giving her warnings so once it hits like three minutes i'll let her know like hey there's three minutes left and the reason why this is so helpful is because can you imagine if you're in the middle of an email or you're in the middle of a thought or you're in the middle of an idea or you're doing something for your job and you're so focused and have such a good idea and you need to write it down before you forget it and you're so excited and then someone comes along and says we gotta go we gotta go leave leave we gotta go you're gonna be like wait what sorry we had to switch sides here but you're gonna be like wait i'm not done i need to finish this like i'm in the middle of the stock i need to get this down before i forget that's kind of how they feel they it's not fair to just pick up what you're doing and expect them to stop what they're doing right away you know kind of give them that respect of okay i understand that you're playing with this toy and you really like it but we're gonna do this in five minutes just a quick warning um i do this any time we're gonna leave the house anytime we're gonna leave our relatives houses so alathia loves her grandparents and this is one that i really have to always press the timer or like make sure i let her know because then she's less likely to get upset because she's giving a warning ahead of time another thing that i use timer for is when i go to the store and this has really helped me so she's at the age where she loves to walk around loves to see people and like interact and whatnot at the store which i'm totally fine with but now that i have two i can't be at a store for like 30 minutes to get two things so one thing i started to do is when we get to the store and we're in the parking lot i never know like okay lazy for the first 15 minutes of us being in the store you're gonna be in your stroller once the timer goes off you can walk around so what i do when i go to a store is i get all the stuff i need to get in those 15 minutes and get everything that i need and then i'll let her walk around for a couple minutes and let her walk and explore and whatnot after i get all my things so that has been really effective sometimes it's not that effective but you know it's hit or miss but at least we try at least we try all right i have two more problems i have two more preventative things next one is to give your kid all of your attention at least once a day and if you're at stay-at-home mom you're probably looking at me like excuse me this one i do all day i'm with them all day how could i give them possibly any more of my attention and that's true but this is another thing i learned from a big little feelings most of the time when we are with our kids we're kind of like half and half we're trying to finish dinner we're trying to put the dishes away we're trying to do this we're talking to someone on the phone we're finishing an email we're doing this we're constantly doing other things throughout the day so our kids kind of feel like they have to fight for our attention this might be a big reason why kids might be having tantrums because the kids that misbehave the most are the kids that need the most love and the most attention so even though you might be like dude i'm with this kid all day well are you with them one-on-one are you giving them that interaction that eye contact are you playing are you sitting with them are you interacting with them so um with big little feelings what she said is like a huge thing that helps is just spending like 10 minutes a day with your kid just one-on-one like no distractions no interruptions no siblings no phones nothing the kid gets to pick what you guys play with you play with it you interact with them and give them all that love and attention that they need obviously you're not limited to 10 minutes like that's not at all what i'm saying but do what you can but give them this time that they know that they're with you so they don't always feel like they're pleading and begging for your attention because even if they're throwing a tantrum and doing all this you might be doing the dishes and you'll stop and be like ah and give them all this attention negative attention is still attention and they still want that so that right there might be a huge help to a lot of kids and last thing is are they bored and that's a very simple thing i've noticed with alexia when she starts to get bored she starts to go she turns into tasmanian devil starts hitting things starts pulling things of plants and this and that and i'm like oh my gosh what am i gonna do right now so i've noticed when she's bored is when she misbehaves or like lashes out the most and i will stop what i'm doing and i will pull out a sensory game or a sensory thing to do kids love sensory i'll pull out the paint i'll pull out my lentil beans i'll pull out the chalk i'll pull out the bubbles in the water i'll pull out all these things that are like very fun censoring things to get her on board and give her something to do and i notice that right away things cut out and stop with all of that in mind if these preventative things don't work and they won't all the time here comes the tantrum here comes them throwing on the ground throwing pencils and crayons and all over the place which again is normal it's okay our goal isn't to stop them from happening our goal is to kind of help them cope so the goal here is to control acknowledge and affirm their feelings okay hope ari isn't too distracting yes he sits here you looking at the bright lights i'm going to say this again so we want to help them control acknowledge and we want to affirm the feelings that they are feeling like i said big feelings they're having big feelings and we want to help them control that we want to help them regulate them we want to help them understand what's going on because there are a lot of adults nowadays like our age that still don't know how to do this so helping your toddler do this will be so beneficial to them not only in their toddler years but like as they mature and become adults everyone needs to learn how to acknowledge and control and affirm their feelings so before i do start all the tantrum stuff though i do want to go into this with a couple of things that i avoid doing and i'll kind of explain them as i go but first phrase and thing i avoid is saying it makes me sad when you hit or it makes me sad when you talk back it makes me sad when you knock over the plant i avoid saying anything that has to do with my feelings and the reason for that is because you're gonna end up having a people pleaser on your hand it's not a lazy responsibility to help me with my own feelings and how i feel her job is to handle her feelings and my job is to handle my feelings so saying that what she's doing is making me feel a certain way is going to make her feel like she has like her feelings she has to help me with my feelings and make me feel good which is not the case at all and you're gonna end up with a people pleaser on your hand which is me i'm a people pleaser nowadays um and i don't like it so that's one phrase i avoid another phrase i avoid that oh my gosh i don't know why but it just like something inside me just like goes off when someone says this and that is good girl when people say this to my kid i don't know why but i'm like dude my my kid is not a dog that's what you say to dogs isn't it like oh good girl like you sat like not to a kid saying good girl implies that there are bad girls and there's no such thing as a bad kid and to say that kids are bad no no kids are not bad maybe they aren't acting the way you'd like them to act but kids are not bad so saying good girl implies that there are bad girls and overall i just really don't like using that phrase next one and this is something that used to drive me crazy when i was a kid and that is oh well big kids do this big kids make their beds big kids put away their toys big kids blah blah fill in the blank the reason i avoid using anything referring to a big kid gives the impression that being at this age isn't fun and you're not able to do anything and if you're a big kid and you're older then that's when the fun starts that's when the good stuff is i never want alathia to not enjoy the stage or age that she's at just because of that i always want her to think like i am well and capable and intelligent and important and independent right now not when i'm a big kid so i kind of just avoid that and last one and now this is something i actually used to do pretty frequently and i noticed it was just like not effective and then when i saw an account post about this i was like oh well that makes sense and i think a lot of us do this and that is when we're leaving and our kid isn't coming we say okay bye i'm leaving without you i'll be gone and i avoid using this and what i say instead is ari and i are gonna go to the store would you like to come with us and it changes everything because then she always says yes like she always wants to be with ari so she'll always want to come but saying i'm leaving without you makes him feel so bad like can you imagine if you're at home and your mom is going to leave and she's going to leave without you and like doesn't want to wait for you like that doesn't really make you feel good so i avoid using that phrase for that reason and what i say instead is i blank so and so we are going to go would you like to join us because then that makes them feel included makes them still feel loved and wanted all right now let's get to the tantrum part because i know that's why y'all are here so first and foremost anytime i'm dealing with alethia or communicating with her or talking to her i'm always giving her eye contact i always sit down i'm always at her level so she can see me and i'm not hovering or above her or inferior or just like taunting over her i always sit down i'm always on the floor like i'm always on the floor looking at her eye so going into that when they have their tantrum what big little feelings does and they post about this on their account all the time and if you're tired of me talking about them then you need to follow them so you understand what i'm talking about because they will go through these examples in real life with their own kids and show on instagram and on their stories they always do tantrum tuesdays or something like they'll share tons of information and it's just so helpful so what they do is first thing you want to do is acknowledge your kids feelings so let's say they're throwing themselves on the ground um because they wanted mac and cheese and they didn't get mac and cheese so first we're gonna acknowledge your feeling we're going to let them know like i see you're upset i hear that you're upset we want to acknowledge their feeling and not suppress it or move it to the side we want to let them know that we see what they're feeling not only does it help them with understanding what feeling you're feeling but it's also nice to be affirmed what you're feeling so i see that you're upset it's okay to feel upset so the second thing we'll want to do is affirm that so let them know it's okay to feel sad it's okay to be frustrated it's okay to be mad it's okay to have whatever big feeling it is that you're having now this may vary depending on what your kid is doing so if they're hitting or if they're throwing or they're doing some type of behavior that's not acceptable we need to let them know so it's okay to feel sad but when we feel sad it's not okay to hit it's not okay to throw so let them know like what they're doing as an action of that is not okay and then from there we're gonna want to switch to a yes so switch to something that they can do and kind of distract them from whatever it is that they were upset about so for example and this is something that i do all the time so fellaini is throwing herself on the ground i let her know okay i see you're upset that you don't get to eat mac and cheese and it's okay to feel upset we don't throw ourselves when we feel upset we're gonna go over here and grab our dinner would you like to walk or be carried so we give them two options one again that gives them that sense of independency sense of control over what's going on um but walk or be carried is like my go-to because most of the time either she wants to me to carry her or she can walk so that's like my go-to but you can tell them like okay would you like mac and cheese or would you like grapes would you like water or would you like apple juice like give them options or give them something to say yes to and then repeat and you'll probably repeat it 15 times before this ends but that's okay and repetition is key and this is why i love this script and big little feelings has the script all over the instagram but i love the script because it gives me something that i know i can do like i just stick to the script and it'll be over soon and on the inside trust me i'm not all calm and peaceful and collected i am screaming on the inside and i'm like dude just eat the mac and cheese but on the outside i'm cool calm collected and i've noticed that losing your cool on your kid takes a lot more effort than it does to stay cool calm and collected and every time i've gotten upset at her or lost my cool on her i've regretted it immediately and it has been a hundred percent unefficient unproductive nothing nothing comes out of it so it's been a lot easier to follow this route because it's very successful and it works really well so repeat yourself and i know it's gonna seem like you're saying it over and over again and then you'll see it'll start to click for them it'll start to work and they'll stop that tantrum so fast you'll get distracted and be on to the next thing and you're like oh wow that wasn't too bad so this has worked really well for us and i'll insert the video here of when i got it for lathe yeah it's honestly not the best example but like i said she hasn't been doing them that frequently so any time that she did it i was like i'm just going to get the slime video so i'll roll that clip now alithea i understand that you want to snack when you're upset you don't get one it's okay to feel upset but right now   alicia right now isn't snack time i see you're upset you don't have you don't get to have a snack it's okay to feel upset but right now it's bath time would you like me to carry you or would you like to walk upstairs   would you would you like to walk upstairs or would you like for me to carry you upstairs for us to take our bath   alicia would you like to walk upstairs or would you like me to carry you okay okay i'll carry you so to be honest i don't even remember what she was getting upset about but she got distracted and was done over with it so quickly so like i said just stick to the script the shifting to the yes for alathia is the game changer because it gives her something else to think about it gives her control over something and she feels independent and is on to the next thing so this has worked really well for us and hope this video is helpful it's not meant to make you feel guilty or shameful of anything because we all have our moments too we are all human you're still a good mom whether you stream or don't scream you're still a good mom if you lose your cool or don't lose your cool like we are all in this together girl we do lose our cool but like i said more often than not i've found it's a lot more effective to stay cool stick to my script keep my peace and she keeps her peace oh and wait last thing i didn't even mean to write this i didn't write this down but one thing that has really helped with alethia is if she's like losing her cool i will do all of this whispering she tends to be a little bit more of like a louder kid which is fine she's very expressive um and sometimes it's like a lot god bless you sometimes it can be a lot and i've noticed that if i start whispering and saying all of this she brings her level down a lot so your child will feed off of you and feed off of your energy and how you're reacting to the situation and um a great wait i have a great example of this and don't judge me for this but alecia wasn't walking it so she was under a year and she was watching tv once and she actually fell off the couch and like went face first and her nose was bleeding and it wasn't bleeding right away and i was holding her and i was trying to calm her down and then it started bleeding and i started panicking and freaking out and i was with my mom and that's when i started freaking out and alexia immediately went from here to here and her crying and like it went through the roof and she was so much more upset so much more like crying and freaking out because i was crying and freaking out so if you keep your cool your kids will keep your cool too um and one last thing what was it that i wanted to say i just thought of it um i can't remember i can't remember

one baby down one to go     okay let's get dressed first i love your hair you look so pretty in the morning i'm gonna change your diapers we have to change our diaper first okay hey wow it's dada he's making breakfast are you gonna say good morning ari   no no no no no no good morning guys welcome back to my channel today we're going to be doing a real day in the life of having two under two so i have olivia and ari over there let's see okay and they are 16 months apart so alathia is currently 19 months and ari is three months they're both gonna go on to the next month within the next couple of weeks um and i'm just going to be showing you guys what our life looks like having 202 it is a very challenging but it is so nice and so rewarding having the two babies really close together because she loves him to death and they get along really well and i still have okay okay okay baby i thought it would be interesting to just kind of show you guys how things go throughout our day with their schedules their naps their feedings and everything that happens during the day yeah thank you you put it back so right now it's the morning i will get both the kids you want to show are you mickey mouse okay okay so you want to sing mickey mouse to ari yeah okay go ahead you can sing    that we'll see how many words i can get out of my mouth before she tries to talk to me again but in the mornings i really like waking up before the kids even if it's just 30 minutes so okay yes you want to sing to him go ahead   but that's making breakfast my back yeah do we do can i finish real quick and then we'll go downstairs huh all right so i try to wake up 30 minutes before the kids maybe an hour it depends on like how our night was with ari he's currently going through that three-month four-month sleep progression so it's been really hard at night like the other day we didn't even sleep for more than like 30 minutes at a time so depending on how our nights go we'll determine how early i wake up but um what i've been doing is trying to work out every other day and then those other days that i don't work out i will do my devotional and i'll actually start work because i've noticed if i have like a full hour of like no interruptions no phone nothing i can get like three hours worth of work done in that one hour so i feel like i get a huge headset on the day and i'm able to like finish my day early instead of like finishing around like five i finished round four and like with the lathia it makes a huge difference because then i'm able to be with her for a little bit longer so that's kind of what i'll do and then jordan i kind of switch with who does breakfast and who is up here like dressing the kids and hanging out with them for a little bit um so jordan's making breakfast right now alathia is up here so we're probably going to play in here for a little bit alright he's over there and then he's going gonna go down for his nap pretty soon so he'll be awake for about an hour hour and a half before he goes down for his first nap and in the mornings i feed him normally around six whenever he wakes up and i'll only feed him on one side and then i'll go do my things and then i'll come back and feed him on the other side because like my breasts are just so full from the whole night of not feeding that if i feed him on both sides it's like way too much for him so i empty out one side and then until the other side you have a knife that's safe yum this is what jordan made us for breakfast he's currently changing alecia's diaper she just had a poopy we have a little changing station down here this is key kiki key so we have these cabinets right here i have a little cute basket has alathia and ari's diapers the little changing pad she's sitting on i'll link it down below but it's really convenient because just throw it on the couch and then change their diapers and then we don't have to go all the way upstairs and then while we are eating breakfast mr ari will be over here playing he really really likes this mat um and then either i'll do tummy time for him or whatever mood he's in we also have the jolly jumper but right now he seems content there so i'm gonna put him there okay we're all done with breakfast now i'm just gonna do a quick little cleanup jordan actually did clean up the dishes and stuff for what he used when he made our food but i'm just gonna put our plates and stuff away and while i do that she's gonna roam around free so big change well we've kind of always had it like this but big thing that really helps is having all of her toys at a reachable height for her so i have this right here i have these two little bins these are from target and i have cards in here i have mainly books um and like little things for her to play with but everything is reachable so she can play here if she wants um she has her dolls ari is almost gonna go down for his nap so she's just gonna roam around free while i clean up and do the dishes okay it's around ten this is when ari will normally take his first little nap and i have him nap in here he really really likes it in here so i might have to rock him at first to get him kind of drowsy and sleepy and then i'll put him back in here hello what do you have popcorn where'd you get popcorn okay i don't have re sound machine down here wait can you show the title so we put this thing up it's a 12 hour brown noise with a black screen and we'll put that up really loud and then he's right here so it can kind of block out any of the noise that um his very quiet sister might be doing he'll normally stay asleep for about two hours and alecia has two hours until she goes down for her nap   okay alathia is outside with jordan i am currently getting a little head start on work she's with him outside right now um i have just a little bit of stuff to do today um i'm posting an igtv right now i actually went to target yesterday and had a really successful trip because i feel like lately target has like not i don't know i feel like i've gone there a couple of times and i haven't really found anything nice but i found a really cute jacket i found a backpack for latvia i got one of my favorite nursing bras so i'm posting that right now um and what time is it we have about an hour until lately goes down for her nap so ari is still sleeping he'll be asleep for another hour so normally in the mornings we just spend time with her um i do get help so i have my mom and jordan's mom they when i got pregnant they were like we're watching the kids they're like do not dare get a babysitter do not dare get a nanny we want to watch the kids so um jordan's mom watches her two days a week and my mom watches her two days a week and then wednesdays in the middle of the week is when i'm with her and um we don't get any help but jordan's mom will take her for a couple of hours in the afternoon so she'll normally take her for like two hours and then my mom lives an hour away so when my mom comes she will spend the afternoon here so um but she's not coming today because she's a little bit busy so every week varies and it depends on their schedule too like i'm not forcing them to come here if they have other things to do like that's totally fine um but that's normally what happens is that they'll help me in the afternoon when she wakes up from her naps so i like to spend the mornings with her jordan likes to spend the mornings with her and then once the kids go to down for their naps is when we get as much stuff as we can get done like i was saying she just plays around in the morning sometimes i'll go out and run errands with her too i kind of need to go run errands right now but she seems really content outside so my rule of thumb is like if she's content and good and what she's doing i'm gonna leave her be because i'm not gonna force her to get up if she's enjoying herself so i normally kind of just play it by ear and see how things are going right now she seems pretty chill if i see that she starts to get a little bit like bored of being inside i'll go quickly running errands with her   i know you want to play outside but it's dirty and cold out we having some big feelings okay can you show me how you count down from ten times seven what about your abcs just a little bit right there don't want to get your cups   another binky you have a whole collection of your binkies are you gonna take a nice long nap hey dudes i love you   you want to pray all right let's pray father god thank you for this wonderful day and this morning you've given us i pray that you bless tookie and give her a good day and for grammy is there hair there no we're good love you ari is fed burped jordan's going to head over to work i'm going to pick up a couple things around the house do a couple of work things while lazy naps so her nap is normally from 12 until about three so she does take a three hour nap which is a blessing so i get as much as i can during those three hours aria will be awake for about another hour and then he'll go down for his snap but right now is play time for him so i recently came up with this little situation here so normally i don't have it in the kitchen normally i have it over there in my desk area but right now i'm working in the kitchen so i'm gonna be able to see him but my bestie esther let me borrow this nuna leaf i personally would not buy it because it's very expensive and it does not move on its own i mean it's nice to move side to side but you have to manually do it yourself so for the price i don't think it's worth it i mean it's beautiful but we need some practicality here but are you smiling at me because i'm talking to you but because he just did eat putting him in this because it's inclined because he recently ate and then we got this in his panda crate box from last month two months ago and it's really cute it's actually supposed to be used like this where it's like a triangle and you can like fold it and it stays up like this for when they do tummy time like you can switch around certain things but i think it's nice because it opens up all the way so i'll normally hang it over my desk or i'll hang it over the chair like this and then it's really cute because he can just look and stare at it so i'm gonna let him stay here until he gets fussy i'm gonna clean up and pick up around the house a little bit and then i'll check back in hey all right change of plans we're gonna go outside i'm gonna put them in the garage i need to clean my car and it's a beautiful day out today so i'm gonna have him jump outside and get some fresh air while i try and clean the car okay this is my last effort i'm gonna wear him but i'm starving i this is like this is the thing when you have the two kids and one doesn't want to nap or they get off their schedule like everything is thrown off and i just want to eat i just went and peed and i was holding him i had to put my pants down while i was holding him like it's just been one of those days i've tried everything it's been about an hour of trying to get him back to sleep and he just won't but when i put him down he gets really upset so dude i need to eat so i can be happy again because i'm currently not the happiest i'm hangry okay scarf down my food and not even two minutes and now i'm feeding him he's gotten drastically more upset i couldn't figure out how to untie that stupid carrier and he was getting so mad and so he's calming down now and he's eating and hopefully he'll go back to sleep because olathe is about to wake up and i need to go get her so she can eat i'm confused are you awake now are you awake now i don't get it what you're something else hi i can't be mad i can't look at the face i can't he's so sweet how is your nap you look like you took a good one you want are you to go on an airplane okay oh god hey we're gonna go eat lunch and then we're gonna go out okay do you wanna play for two more minutes in two minutes we'll go down and eat some lunch okay one more minute until we go downstairs two one more minute okay two minutes are up we're gonna go downstairs to eat our lunch normally yeah we we played up here for two minutes now we're gonna go downstairs to eat our lunch it seems like unless   okay kids are secured double chins are secured and we are heading down the stairs okay so she loves apple juice which i'm fine with but i do dilute it 50 with water so i poured apple juice in here and then i already have it diluted so when she wants juice i just give it from here because then i don't have to do double the amount of work of having to add juiced and white you know it's just it's just easier this way we will play this activity okay when you're done with your   green juice right now it's lunchtime yeah it's lunch time when you're done eating your food you can hold it but when you're done eating your food when you're done when you're done eating i will give it okay she does not seem like she's hungry right now and so i'm not gonna force her to eat she's playing with ari for now and then she'll let me know when she's hungry so i want her to have a healthy relationship with her so i'm never gonna force her to eat or force her to finish her plate or for sure to start eating it so so i'm just gonna let her chill out with ari for a little bit and then i'll keep this food here it's not gonna go bad i mean she's not gonna eat it in like four hours she'll probably eat it within the next 30 minutes but i'll just leave it up here it's easily accessible to her and she wants her apple juice you can come get it she wants to eat she can come get it so at least she knows it's there and we'll see what she chooses to do all right we're back inside and look she came say hi say hi to who uh yes we went and said hi to the pumpkin so we went on a short little walk there's someone down the street that has like those inflatable pumpkins so we went to go say hi but she said she couldn't touch it so we just said hi but as soon as we came back inside she wanted to eat so there we go yeah we don't touch the pumpkin we'll we just wave yeah um but see you don't need to force your kids okay okay well there's still suku in there once you're done with that i'll get you more okay so that was great because i was able to get her settled and her to eat and mr ari over here fell asleep he loves the stroller and i finally got him to nap just kidding dude you were napping three seconds ago okay hopefully i'll go back to sleep bye no mama no no no no no no no no no   all right mr ari has been very testing he just wants extra love today and extra snuggles just fine it's just a short season he's only a baby for so long can you tell i'm crying on the inside because i am and the only thing that's gonna make me feel better is nutella and pretzels so tooky and i are eating at nutella with pretzels jordan is back home i tried handing aria off to him but he screamed even more so this is what i'm gonna be doing until he decides to fall back asleep for his nap i was gonna go out actually and go to the store like i was telling you guys but i don't think it's a good idea i feel like that can wait until tomorrow when we're all in a better mood i can you want more nutella okay one second let me finish this and then i'll get you more nutella um i can get into the car i can get it shipped like i don't have to physically go out i just thought it'd be nice because it's such a beautiful day yeah but like i said i feel like it would have been a disaster and not a good idea so i'm not gonna do that i'm gonna get started on dinner but i'm gonna finish the vlog here i'm actually gonna do a nighttime routine because our night time routine is pretty regimen and i got it down the hat when jordan was gone of being able to shower two babies at the same time and get them done fed ready and in bed at a reasonable time so i'm gonna do a separate video on that but i hope you guys enjoyed i love you guys and i'll see you in my next video bye okay say bye more people say bye i love you whoa what happened here hello you got more pretzels so i don't even use a foundation anymore good morning guys happy monday welcome to today's video i'm going to be talking all details about my ring kind of making it more fun and more of like a vlog today as well but today's monday morning so i started off by putting things away i feel like i always start off my mondays like this i just kind of want to get everything prepped and ready for the week um i just filmed an ig tv showing you guys how i've been doing my makeup every day which has been super easy and takes me two minutes mammal products looks so glowy and natural on the skin like sometimes you can't even tell that i'm wearing makeup and i've been really into that look lately um so i just filmed that alexia is actually still sleeping ari is with jordan downstairs he's getting breakfast ready i'm about to get alesia and while i'm filming this i'm also filming a um week in my life of what i wear i guess me and my kids edition so just conti just posted this video and i was like oh my gosh that's genius i did a video like this a while back when alesia was like two months old i think and a lot of you really enjoyed that so i'm kind of doing the same thing and just like remind me of that video because so many of you have been asking for fall videos and stuff and i'm like uh fall fashion videos are so much work and i feel like not everyone really likes them or enjoys them so i feel like doing a week of what i wear with my kids is super practical and super easy for you guys to kind of just pull inspiration from and kind of like pull inspiration for your kids and see like kind of how we dress so i feel like that's more of a real and practical way of doing that so that's another thing i'm doing right now but today is going to be a busy day i'm going to wake up a lathey now i'm drinking my coffee out of my yeti because so many of you told me to do this which duh like such a simple thing to do but every morning when i drink my coffee it's always colder i have to like reheat it 17 times so putting it in here makes it so hot sometimes where i like can't drink it right away but i love it because it stays warm for at least like three hours which is normally how long it sadly takes for me to finish my coffee but let's go wake up a little   yeah hmm do you want to do your affirmations no no can you say affirmations no can you just say the word affirmations say affirmations no no okay i love you i sure do i love you so much i would love to eat your cheeks right here what's that that whole that's my tripod for my camera do you want to do your affirmations all right forget the affirmations you want to see art i my two babies hi baby ari has been so much more alert he tries to hold things look look he looks at her he's smiling at you he loves you oh my goodness whoa yesterday miss alecia drew crayon on her pickler slide thing yes you found elmo here come help me i'm going to try and take this out oh yes yay okay this is a magic erase marker and it's coming right off oh thank god i was so nervous because i was like goodness if this does not come off this is gonna look so bad and she's gonna want to keep doing it so great okay good to know dry erase marker does take out crayon off of wood and if you if you have kids and you don't have a dry erase marker you should go pick one up these are really cool you just like get them wet perfect since i already have this out i guess i'm just gonna go around the walls and get anything else that might be all gross so her little rocking chair always hits the wall and leaves marks there it goes i just made up a quick little activity for her to do these are orbeez i think is what they're called um i have had this mixture for about over a year now i just reuse it frequently um but i mixed blue white purple and like different shades of blue so it kind of looks like the ocean and then i found these little sea creatures at um either hobby lobby or michael's so right now what she's playing is capture the sea creatures so she's using that tool which she's still quite figuring out how to use um and then putting them in here to rescue them okay thank you thank you vivian oh no one okay nope doing that if you try to eat it again we're gonna have to put it away uh oh okay we're done it is not safe to eat those okay mr lathia is down now let's talk about why you are even here and why you clicked on this video so so many of you noticed and i wasn't gonna talk about it at first but i realized that a lot of you are probably engaged want to be engaged or are married want a new ring whatever so i thought i would just talk about it um the number one question i always got when i was pregnant so when i got pregnant with alathia my actual wedding band and wedding ring did not fit anymore so i had to stop using it i got like another one that was like a hundred bucks or something and was using that um because i did gain a lot of weight so when jordan and i first got married i was like a hundred pounds and my ring was significantly smaller than what it is now i've gained like 35 pounds since being married from having kids and just like overall not being in the best shape so add that i know you can get your ring resized but i didn't want to do that so because it was our three year anniversary jordan was like let's wait until it's our five year anniversary i was like no dude i just birthed two of your kids intensive labor here i i have given you the joys of your life the least you could do is give me a ring you know what i'm saying so i did get a new ring and this is my new wedding ring and it is not real it is a moisonite moissanite i'm not sure how you pronounce it but i was on pinterest one day and i was like determined to figure out what kind of ring that i wanted and i really like the bigger looking rings i mean who doesn't but i'm not a fan of that price because diamonds are very very expensive so it was kind of like looking and i stumbled across the moisenite and i didn't realize what it actually even meant i listen i it was in the middle of the night when i was like breastfeeding my child i thought it was the shape i didn't realize that and then i started to put the pieces together and i was like wait this is so cool so it's ethical and sustainable significantly more affordable but it looks just like a diamond it actually sparkles even more like to me it looks clearer and crisper and i was able to get a really large size for like half of the price as if i would have gotten a real diamond so let me show you guys up close what it looks like and then i'll talk a little bit more detail i did go ahead and paint my nails just for you guys but just this hand because my other hand is not painted but this is what it looks like it is stunning so clear and i did a yellow gold band this is what it looks like from the side the front again just very crisp white so now that you see what it looks like this is kind of like what it looks like on my fingers i do have pretty small hands so i wanted something that was big but not too big where it was like overpowering and like didn't look that nice because i feel like there's definitely like things can definitely look exaggerated so i definitely wanted something a little bit more minimal i also wanted something that sat very high which this does and it does have just four prongs that hold the moistener inside and this is equivalent to a 3.5 carat diamond so moisenet is not like the standard of the size is not measured the same as diamond so um the website that i got it on i actually found it on pinterest like i was saying i was just on pinterest all the time trying to find things and i love pinterest so i came across this account um on instagram their name is zen moisenite so this is actually the exact not the exact ring i have but this is a version of it so this is called the harley and yellow gold this one in this picture is a 2.5 minus a 3.5 so again it's slightly bigger um but this is it so i will link this down below and like i said this was like half the price of a diamond for the size that i wanted um and then i wanted a really thin yellow band i use yellow gold all the time and my previous ring was like silver which i don't use all that much so i feel like this just looks so much more cohesive with what i wear and then this ring that i wear on this side um i get questions about it all the time it is not real it is not a cartier i got it off of amazon for like 10 bucks and i love it and it's not gotten green at all it's like been super durable but i just thought i'd throw that out there i'll link that one down below too um but yeah i just wanted something that sat really high okay and then this is a size six but because the diamond is a little not the diamond but because the moistenette is like kind of heavy it kind of does like swing around a little bit which makes me nervous so on amazon delilah sit down you are so um i didn't want to get it like fully resized and have to do that and then like get pregnant again and make it small you know just like i'd rather just it be a little bit bigger and then have the capability of being able to gain weight because i do like i don't know if you are the same but when i gain weight i see it in my hands immediately it's so strange to me but that's what happens so i found this thing on amazon it's a clear let's see if you'll see can you see that it's like a clear little ring looking thing and you actually put it on the inside and the back of your ring like this and then when you put it on it makes it just a little bit more snug and makes it stay perfectly in place so now my diamond or not diamond sorry i'm just so used to seeing that now the ring isn't like moving around as much it like stays more secure and i feel a lot better about it it doesn't bother me on the back at all i kind of fidget around with it and play with it but um in this case in this little when i went to order this it came with like a pack of like 10 for different sizes so they have different thicknesses i was afraid it wasn't gonna fit because this band is so thin but it actually did this is the smallest one that came in the pack so i did keep the other ones just in case i get other rings that end up being big or whatnot but that has definitely made it feel a lot better and a lot more secure um but yeah i i'm not like an expert at moisenet like i'm not so sure about all of the details of what goes into making that ring and whatnot all i know is that it's stunning beautiful and a lot more affordable and unless like i don't know feel like when you look at it it looks real no one's gonna think otherwise and when i told you guys that it wasn't a real ring so many of you were shocked and you were like what the heck is that then um so i will leave a link to this down below if you guys are curious about it um i did want to show you the wedding band i'm gonna get because i am planning on getting a new one um i haven't ordered it yet because i just haven't gotten around to doing it so i wanted something super dainty that was kind of like my goal for all of this was dainty is he doing so good this little piggies over here hi um let me show you real quick so this this wedding band i also found on pinterest i'm telling you it's really nice to go on pinterest because you can find exact rings that you want and then i'll take you right to their website so this one is from a company called melanie casey now i originally wanted a ring from this company but the size that i wanted the rings were going to be 20 000 and there is no way i would ever pay that price so that's when i started looking for like different things and then i stumbled across the the moisenet but her wedding bands are a reasonable price so this is the one i would like to get it's a yellow gold with like little tiny diamonds in between and i love like the daintiness of it and how delicate it looks and she has tons of rings like this that are super delicate like here's another example there's another example um i just think her jewelry like look at this she does stacks she does a lot of stacks which is the main reason why i wanted this so i was thinking every five years to get a new band and like a new stack but it won't look super bulky or big it'll like look really dainty because they're really thin and really soft which is like the look that i love so that's kind of why i was going for more of that like little tiny feel because then i can easily stack um and i don't know i'm just really into the more dainty more delicate looking pieces um because i do wear quite a lot of other jewelry and i don't want i don't know i didn't want something too heavy and although this is large it doesn't feel large it doesn't get tangled doesn't get caught i've gotten it caught on my hair a couple of times but it just like easily comes right out so it's not that big of a deal i haven't scratched my kids at all um nothing about it is really pointy my previous ring was a cushion so it was like a square and the pointy the points were a little bit not soft so um   yeah i'll try to answer your questions down below i'll leave links to both the wedding band and this ring um if you guys are curious about it there's tons of companies that make them as well i found really good ones on um etsy too which was really nice i liked this company because they have a lifetime warranty as well um and it is custom made so it took about six to eight weeks and then once it was done it only took two days to get to my house and it is a canadian company so i really recommend them jordan had a really good time working with her she was super sweet was answering my emails and dms and questions and all of that so again i'll leave them down below but i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you're engaged you're about to be engaged congrats it's so exciting and so nerve-wracking to like find a ring that you will like for the rest of your life because if you're like me my child my style changes like every other day so that's why i wanted something like this that would just like be classic so it is an oval shape but hope you guys enjoyed i love you and i'll see my next video bye wow would you like to sing a song hey guys welcome to my channel today we are doing a week in my life of outfits hello this video was inspired by jess conte she did a week in my life of videos or outfits that i wear so i'll link her video down below but i wanted to add a little twist to it and i included my kids outfits so i always get questions about their outfits so i thought it would be really easy to just kind of see like what a week looks like of what my kids and i wear um and i just want to put this out there i don't want you to feel like you have to buy all of these pieces or buy everything brand new i kind of want this to be more of like an inspo thing so for you guys to pull out different inspiration of like maybe how to wear flannel how to wear a hat or how to style boots like i don't want you to feel like you have to go out and buy all new things i want you to use what you have and maybe style things a little bit differently um and then i know i'll get comments about this a lot too but my kids don't really wear like bright colored things honestly it's because it makes my life easier because they blow out and spit up and all of this stuff all day long this is the most color you'll see are you wearing yes this little blue pants um but it's so much easier when they're closer neutral because i could pick out an outfit with my eyes closed in the middle of the night if i needed to um because everything will just end up matching anyway so this video is not sponsored i've paid for everything myself for both the kids and i um but i will leave links to things if i'm still able to find it but like i said don't feel like you have to buy something new try to use this as inspiration so we're doing monday through friday maybe i should have done like sunday through sunday but uh let me know if you want me to do that next time but i hope you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up if you want yeah because this is a thumbs up give this video a thumbs up if you guys would like more outfit videos like this including the kids and let's get started good morning guys this is today's outfit a lot of these outfits will be determined more so of the weather so today it's going to be in the 50s and 60s high of 70 but still a little bit chilly so i just have a light trench coat on a mock turtleneck layered with some really cute jewelry that i have on these mom jeans that are super loose fit and to be honest these aren't really cute unless you roll it up like this because it gives you kind of like some shape and i really really like these these are probably like one of my favorite pairs because they're super high-waisted and super baggy so they're very comfortable and feel so good and i can easily sit on the ground with my kids and cross my legs and pick them up and like not have to worry about my jeans ripping and then i am wearing doc martens these are like a staple for me i've been using them every single day i really didn't want to invest in them because i thought they were pricey but well worth the investment because i seriously use them every day and then i have this trench coat on it's super lightweight but i feel like a trench coat like this is a need and a must especially if you're on the shorter side for me i'm 5'1 so an easy way for me to make myself look elongated and longer is to use coats like this because they just give you some more definition so i really like using coats like this i feel like a trench coat is just so perfect and then as you guys saw in the very beginning of the clip i did style them with these sunglasses you'll see me wearing these probably every day i just love these these are super old from h m but um ray-ban makes them and then i feel like there's so many other dupes for them they're just like basic um round sunglasses but i feel like these are so cute and then for my bag i would normally style this with a backpack so my diaper bag is a backpack so i have one from fawn i have a really cute one um that's like a beige color or i have like this really cute little louis vuitton backpack too so that's like kind of what i would style as a purse for this but this is monday for me   how cute bye all right so this is the coat and shoes that are lathey is wearing you'll probably see her wearing this multiple times during the week these are little baby jack martens but i know it can be expensive i get all of her shoes to size up so it will last us the entire winter and these have been my favorite black boots that i found because they are so durable they have a little zipper on the side and they fit her so well and just like easily go on and off so to me it was worth it because i'm not gonna have to buy them that frequently and i know that these will be super durable and then a lot of her coats i do get them from zara or the thrift store the thrift store can be hit or miss i found a really nice normal jean jacket but it was kind of cold so when zara had one that was lined i snagged it because i just think this is so much warmer because jean jackets can be a little bit cold but just like her shoes i get these two sizes up so zara's coats actually run really big so she's wearing two to three clothes and normal stuff but for her jacket i got it in an 8 to 24 month saw how big and oversized it looks on her so it doesn't quite fit her just yet which is fine um but this should last us the entire winter and into the fall and then again all of this stuff ari can use once he's older as well wow oh guest   okay little dumb sucker he was napping earlier so because it is a little bit cooler out i do always layer him so underneath this he has a cute little onesie it's a short sleeve onesie and then he has this really cute little pullover that is from zara and then his little pants are just like ripped little pants i'm gonna put socks on him too but this is what his little outfit looks like and then i just love layering so babies are not supposed to wear coats because they have to go in the car seat and that's not safe so i actually do have a little cover that's from copper pearls so if we do go out i will put that over his car seat and put a blanket on him but he will not wear a jacket this is like as thick as i will go for something because the car seat it's not safe one thing he always has on him is his little passy clip so i actually found this um on etsy it's like a little leather one he's looking at it and i love it i think it's so nice it goes with everything this specific shop is not open anymore i think they're on a vacation but they've been on vacation for like a year so i have a feeling they are not doing this anymore but i will leave similar ones down below and then this is the passy that he likes i got it on amazon it's like an all natural one and it has like a little bend in it if you can see so this is always clipped onto him um but like i said you guys will probably notice a lot of this stuff is really neutral they do go through quite a few outfits a day so it just makes it a lot easier for everything to just mix and match and go with the theme anyway um if he does get a little bit cold i do have tons of little hats for him there's this really cute little beanie that was alathia's um i have some downstairs too but i always like to keep a little hat now that it is getting cooler i like to keep little hats so if we do go outside and it's cold i can just throw one on his head so yeah this is ari's little outfit today are you seeing jesus loves me no what about hokey pokey no what song would you like to sing oh yeah would you like to sing a song   i don't understand   happy tuesday this is today's outfit it is a bit of a warmer day today so i have this t-shirt dress on i got it in a size medium so it's more of an oversized look and then it was cooler in the morning so i have this flannel but i like the way that it looks when you wrap it around like this because it kind of helps give a little more definition um and then these sunglasses are my favorite you'll probably notice i wear a lot of sunglasses just because i feel like i'm outside all the time and i feel like it completes a look these are from amazon i think they're like 13 bucks um i'll link all my jewelry except this i got from tj maxx so i don't know if i'll be able to link that um but then you can't see my shoes in this but for shoes i'm wearing these dupes these are steve madden they're a dupe for the um what are they called what are they called i can't remember but they're like that grungy looking shoe which i actually really like because white sneakers never stay white annually um and then i paired it with these socks they're a little bit higher um but yeah that is today's outfit every wednesday guys this is today's outfit this is probably one of my go-to's and that is a bodysuit with mom jeans and then something thrown on over so right now i'm obsessed with this corduroy jacket i think it's so cute i love the larger buttons um i believe it's from nasty gal but i just love this look for me it's very versatile because with the bodysuit i can easily breastfeed just by pulling it down but then if it gets cold i can throw this over or if i want to wear a sling and wear my baby i can easily do that as well and then throw this back over it's just so easy to do and then like i said you'll see me wearing it these doc martens pretty much every single day of this week um and then what was like oh i want to show you this hack so you guys know those super annoying pads that come inside of your bathing suits well i always end up taking those out because i feel like they make things look weird so i always keep them because when i wear tops like this i am not wearing a bra because you would be able to see the bra because of the straps um but sometimes you can see your nipples so i always hang on to these guys because you can just easily slide it right in and you don't really see it or notice it i actually did forget to put on jewelry but i will most likely not put on a necklace just because i feel like i like the more simple look i'll probably throw on a couple rings and then maybe just some like little gold hoop earrings but ari is still sleeping so once he gets up i'll show you guys what he's going to wear for the day and lazy actually went over for a sleepover so she's at my parents house and i'll also show you guys what she's wearing but from the distance all right happy tuesday for mr ari this is what he's wearing today so i have this really soft nice material um of a little onesie and then just these little ribbed leggings from zara these are my favorite i used to buy these for alithea when she was really little they still have them after a year so i get them they have tons of different colors i think they're so cute and super warm do you like them too and then my favorite thing ever is this little hat i bought this when he was in the hospital because i realized how tiny his little head was and this actually still fits him because it's a newborn size but it's like little bunny ears today is supposed to be a little bit cooler which is why i put the hat on him but we are gonna go out and i'll show you guys what i actually put on my car seat or on his car seat that keeps him warm since he can't wear a jacket i'm obviously gonna put socks on him but i'll show you guys that whenever we go out hey why are you taking this all with us hey all right this is the cover i was talking about so it's from this company called copper pearl it basically just looks like a giant t-shirt that goes over your car seat but it helps keep the heat in so when it's cooler out like today he's able to stay nice and warm in there and he really loves it hello um and then i also do keep a little blanket on him but babies are not supposed to have jackets on because it affects the sizing of their clips so this is a great another option for the actual winter months like really cold i have a different thing that i put on um and if i do like a winter's edition of this video i'll definitely show you guys that but for the fall this is perfect and i will just say if you live somewhere warm i would not recommend this because this keeps the heat in so if you live in florida this would be really bad because it would just keep the heat in and your baby would be like in a literal sauna and not be able to read that well so definitely only for when it is cold outside i wouldn't use it strictly just for like blocking the light out of their face or just for like privacy like this will hold in a lot of heat so just be weary of that and cautious of that so i'm gonna insert clips right now of alethia's outfit for today um even though she's not with us and then tomorrow she'll well today she'll be back but tomorrow we will resume all family outfits   uh   okay there we go   here's mr ari's outfit today he's got little rainbows on and then little mustard pants these are both from h m this one is from when olathe was a baby and then this one i just ordered so it's still on their website here's tookie's outfit today you're so cute you can you show me how to dance mommy yes you want to go find grammy bye all right here is today's outfit i got my period yesterday so i was not about to wear jeans i am wearing it just some leggings these are from fabletics it's their power hold leggings they're one of my favorites and then i have on this like white washed um t-shirt and then just some jewelry my hair is starting to get greasy so i just threw on a cute little hat and then i have on this jacket and i love putting jackets around my waist like this um and i found this at marshalls in the boys section so i always look in the men and the boy sections because i always find really cute things at marshalls or tj maxx and then i'm wearing those white sneakers again like you've probably started to notice a pattern i always like to layer things so i like to layer jewelry i like to layer my outfits to kind of add some juice to it all right guys happy friday today is the last day that i'm going to be doing we are actually going in an rv trip this weekend so that's why i'm in very comfy cozy clothes one of my good friends esther gave me this it's thrifted um and she did crop it but one hack she taught me is not to tuck it into your bra because i used to do that but it doesn't really stay she suggested i grab one of alexia's old headbands like the nylon part so you take the line into the nylon part of the um headband and you like tuck it into your shirt so this was already cropped but not super cropped so i made it more cropped and it goes all the way around and then these sweatpants are my favorite they're from boohoo i believe they're already kind of oversized but i just love the color they're super warm and lined on the inside um and then i'm wearing these shoes again i was gonna wear my air force ones but for our trip i'm trying to only bring like one pair of shoes but i think air force ones would look nicer with this and then these amazon sunglasses that i use all the time i feel like they take an outfit from three to like a seven or an eight um and then i have all the jewelry on that i'm gonna wear for the trip so that's what i'm wearing now for my kitties over here ari is wearing a little oversized sweatshirt and then he is wearing a onesie underneath and then this is from when a lady was a baby but i love pants like this because they have the built-in socks already because you love to kick your socks off huh and then i also have a really cute little beanie for him that i'm gonna have him wear as well he's so sweet he's so sleepy and then alecia is wearing a matching set from zara so i love getting matching sets because it's a really easy way to make your kid look cute but very comfortable um and then i just have her hair up in a little pony thing what you doing on my phone tooks oh who are you calling me no that's not grammy that's who are you calling i say yellow great that's disabled okay press the timer you disabled my phone yeah so alecia's shoes are actually downstairs but i'm gonna link them down below they're one of my favorite shoes um i got them at target they're 10 bucks and they're just like really cute little sneakers with like little two velcro pieces on them i she wears them all the time and they're really easy for just like throwing on and like getting out the door and ready to go um but they also look really cute with everything i'm very picky about little kids shoes um because i want the shoes to be cute but also practical and i find that every time they're cute they're not practical and every time they're practical they're very ugly so like i said i'll leave links to everything that i can find it down below a lot of the stuff is older that i had for ari when lathey was a baby or some of my things are thrifted so i'll try my best to link that stuff down below give this video a thumbs up if you guys would like for me to do different editions of this if you want me to do a winter edition or more of a cooler fall one because this week was kind of abnormal because i was able to wear like shorts and dresses and stuff which i normally can't do in the fall because it's normally really cold but it's not quite at that peak yet so maybe come like november i can re-film this and do like a colder fall edition if you guys would like but i love you guys and i'll see you in my next video bye now it's like more difficult than it was when i first had already good morning guys i have miss alethe with me this morning we are eating our breakfast and she's sitting at the big table well at the island with me well you have to finish your food at the table what are you eating hash browns i made us some hash browns in the airfryer we recently got one and it's so nice guys it's so nice i didn't realize how much i would actually utilize it um and then i made us some over easy eggs and i added parmesan cheese italian seasoning onion onion onion powder and then salt and pepper and it's so good i feel like i'm so over breakfast food because i feel like we eat the same thing all the time so adding in those seasonings made it so good but today i'm just going to be vlogging um i think i'm gonna do ari's four month update i feel like i haven't vlogged in so long i feel like i've been doing more like sit-down videos or have i vlogged i can't even remember samson is home now he came home last night we went to kalahari this weekend um and now everyone is back home including me including melanie just for the day though so melanie we get questions about this all the time i never actually talked about it but melanie went back to school people assumed that like people always assumed the worst they're like did you have a big fight i know she was she never like lived here like forever it was just like a temporary thing because of kovid she like didn't need to be at school anymore so she's in her senior year of her undergrad at michigan state so she's back home or back at michigan state finishing her degree so you're not going to eat i took a picture of you smile   hello hi you take a picture of mama i need a big sally okay   since i'm here i'm gonna take a seven minute jordan said that seven minutes is a key to a good nap i guess because i don't take naps because every time i do i wake up really like drowsy and like it's not very productive so jordan said the keys to doing seven minute dab so i'm gonna try tonight i'm gonna set an alarm for seven minutes and then i'll continue the blog we're all about those great angles aren't we i don't know why but i feel like because i haven't vlogged i don't know how to vlog anymore i don't know if anyone else runs into that issue but sometimes i feel like we do the same thing every day and i'm like does anyone really want to watch this you know um but i just got a thing from thrive we order from them once a month to get any of the like unique things that i normally can't find in store or just things that i like to buy um multiples of so they are sponsoring today's video in case you guys didn't know thrive is an online market where you can get all of your groceries at a really good discounted price anywhere between 25 to 50 off when you get your membership so we have the year-long membership um so it's 12 months and let me just put y'all on the tripod real quick so the membership that we have is just five dollars a month so i think it's definitely worth it to just get that um this is what the box looks like so this is our box i thought i would do a little haul i normally get basically the same thing every time they have really good food you can also shop through your diet so when i was um exclusively gluten free i would shop there all the time because it just made it really easy all i would do is like put in the category like gluten free and then everything would show up they also have paleo vegan they have like every option of what you could eat but this time i got more bath stuff so i wanted to show you guys um i got stuff for the kids because i basically buy the same thing every time for them so it's just a lot cheaper to just buy it from here i went a little overboard but i got soaps for jordan and i i really love this company so i got some of these soaps i got the lavender one and then i also got the eclipse one then for the kids i got the honest stuff that i always get and this scent is sweet orange lavender or wait no sweet orange vanilla it's so nice so i just love the convenience of this because i don't have to go out to the store it gets right to my house it comes so fast and so quick um and normally i just go back through my previous orders and just like re-add things to the cart i also got us some maple syrup i wanted to try out thrive's version of it um i also always get the avocado avocado oil you guys probably see everyone get this but this is their olive oil we go through this in probably like two weeks we use a lot of olive oil so i always stack up on some of that so i'm gonna leave my link down below so you guys can do month to month if you want or you can do the 12 months this was what we do that just ends up saving us a lot of money if you guys join today you can get a free gift up to 24 so i will leave my link down below if you guys want to try it out i know so many of you have raved about trying this out and loving it and now it's become a sample for you guys um but let's have a chat i feel like i have so much to talk about and i feel like vlogs are like the easiest place for me to talk to you guys about um but let's see okay so ari is like four months old now i don't even know i can't believe it's already november it's gonna be my birthday in like two weeks which is so strange because it doesn't feel like it should be my birthday yet um but ari is four and a half months old which is wild but to me this stage like around four months is probably the most difficult stage because i feel like the excitement and like the newborn fate like the newborn phase and like the adrenaline from like just having a baby like starts to wear off so i know like a lot of people assume like when you have a newborn like that's when moms need the most help or like are the most tired but for me it's like not the case at all i'm like so excited i love the newborn stage i think it's so exciting welcoming a new baby and everything and then that slowly starts to fade away and then they stop sleeping as much during the day they become more routine they become more like scheduled and like it's harder for them to fall asleep they go through that four-month sleep regression so like for me right now is like more difficult than it was when i first had ari and i don't know if anyone else can relate to this or like has gone through the same things i have talked to a couple of other moms who have said the same thing so um hopefully i'm not like the only one that is like going through this but yeah i've been so tired because of that and i feel like we are just like non-stop all the time and i'm just like i can't keep my head above water but one thing i'm trying to do is like write down everything i have to do for the whole week on a piece of paper and then like prioritize things because i've just been feeling a little bit overwhelmed um so and i feel like the reason for that is because i have a couple of things that i'm doing that like i traditionally don't do outside of like youtube and um   instagram so one of those is my merch that i'm working on and that has been a pretty long process because i'm very picky and it's my own fault but at the same time i want to like be obsessed with this and love it to death and like want to wear it every single day because if i'm not going to be excited about it and like it why would i talk about it so that has been something that's been a little bit hard to do and then also my presets which you guys have which i've like hinted at it a couple of times but that's another thing that i'm working on so there's two things that i'm trying to do that is untraditional to what i normally do so it's like adds more to the load obviously and then i am revamping my website so i've been wanting to do this for so long and i tried doing it myself i feel like i've told you guys about this i tried doing it myself but it was just way too hard and time-consuming and i was like you know what why don't i just hire someone to do this so i put out a thing on my instagram last week asking you guys to send in your resumes and i was blown away at how talented you guys are so i've been filtering through those and i'm gonna pick someone um and it'll be cool because i'll get to hire one of you guys to do that so i'm super excited but again another thing that i've been trying to work on but i just wanted a website so everything is in one place because youtube i have so much content on youtube i have like almost 300 videos up and even i sometimes forget like what i've even talked about or done videos on and anytime i go to question about something i'm like i swear i've talked about this before but i can't even remember or our podcast we'll talk about stuff and i'll get a question i'm like oh we talked about it in this episode but i'm like what episode what was even that so i wanted to create a website to have everything together and then um i just thought it would just be easier because then you guys can like search through things so you you'll be able to search and pull up youtube or um podcasts or blog posts or like other things like that so like i said a lot of stuff that's going that's just a little update   someone's awake from his neck oh my goodness all right i wanted to do ari's little four month update so he's four and a half months old now which every time i do these updates i can't believe i'm already doing them time is going by so fast so the biggest difference i've noticed with him has been he talks a lot and he recently discovered that he can scream so he does do a little ah out of nowhere and it's honestly the sweetest thing ever and really funny are you sleepy i just spread him so he might be a little bit tired um but he is finally done with that four-month sleep regression which was so annoying it started around three months honestly and it lasted a very long time he was waking up every 30 minutes to an hour and it became really difficult at times that was actually when we started co-sleeping so i went back and forth many times trying to figure out whether i should even talk about this because with alathia i knew i did not want to go sleep i was so against it i thought it was so dangerous and like reckless of people to do and then mr ari came along and he's the snuggliest thing ever and just the only thing that brings him comfort is me which i love and i'm very flattered by because with alathia she never wanted to be held didn't like cuddling didn't like anything like she hated breastfeeding so it's been a totally different experience with him because his attachment to me is so much stronger and if you haven't read into attachment i definitely suggest you do so because it's amazing how god designed us and our babies so with that being said once that sleep regression hit he wouldn't be comforted unless we were holding him and then that app what ended up happening was we were sleeping with him and we wouldn't even realize it so then i started doing some research on co-sleeping and how to do it safely and i found multiple uh pediatricians and doctors and chiropractors and people that are like well respected that would talk about co-sleeping how to do it safely so then after that i was like you know what that's what we're gonna do and i think that's what's best and i think a lot of moms that breastfeed also co-sleep because it just makes it so much easier so that's what we've been doing it's not every single night that we co-sleep i guess he'll start off in his snoo and then if he cries we'll keep him in the bed like it kind of like goes back and forth um but i know a lot of people have opinions on this um so i just didn't know i definitely am not suggesting you do that other than that he is rolling around like crazy all the time he loves the jolly jumper he loves alathia he's like super alert like super duper alert yes yes he's wearing a size 2 diaper now and he's also wearing six-month-old clothes which alathia did not fit in until she was nine months old so he's a lot bigger and a lot longer than alethia was we also found out that he has a heart murmur um when he went into his four-month appointment she said that she noticed that he still had his heart murmur which she had at the three-month appointment um so she was a little bit concerned and we did make an appointment with a cardiologist to get that checked out just to be safe alexia also had one at her three-month appointment but then it went away but because his didn't she just wanted to double check that so i'm not too worried about it but that is something i wanted to mention so i'll keep you guys posted and let you know how that goes at that appointment yeah you needed to wear   you are so sweet i don't know what i'm going to do with you wendy guess who's here grammy grammy's here yeah she went on a walk with ari but she'll be back soon you want to hang out with grammy yeah yeah no i don't know where grampy is just grammy's here good afternoon you look like you nab so well your little marks on your faces she's always like super quiet when she wakes up um but i have these little bows i'll link them down below but they're from amazon and they're super affordable and they come in packs of two do you want to show everyone your new toy rotation yeah lila to me you new toys i showed you guys on instagram but i thought i would show you here too so one thing i've been doing that has really helped her and i feel like she gravitates towards her toys more is this is something they do in montessori so instead of like having a toy with the thing already laid out how it's supposed to be you're supposed to leave it out separate no it did you fart so for example instead of having the puzzle pieces already in the pieces you have it separate so it's a bit of a challenge for them to figure out how to do it so i have a puzzle here i have this here so these little things that go inside the holes and they can actually stack on top of each other this is a little bee catcher so she's supposed to use this tool to pull them out this is for threading so i put these little things here so she threads this through blue what are you doing what are you doing i love your smile oh free hugs thank you you want to talk about me okay okay you want me to you want me to show the rest of your toys all right i got four more cubbies left so this right here is just like little clips so she's supposed to take them off and put them back on um and then here just building blocks over here is like a little stacking thing so she's supposed to put these with the corresponding color and then last one this is the easiest and my favorite it's a little animal rescue so i put them inside little baggies for her to try and take them out and she loves this activity all right alecia's upstairs and screaming so while she's here i'm gonna try and get a little bit more work done i hope you guys enjoyed today's video i'm gonna leave the links down below to thrive if you guys want to try it out and then also link um her playroom stuff i'm actually gonna do a video either here or on ig tv showing you guys like some must-haves to do like diy toys um because i feel like a common misconception with any like educational toys is that they're expensive but you can easily do it with recyclables or just common things around the house so i thought i would share like what i constantly have in stock to kind of like make my toys for alethia um and just like random little knickknacks and like things like that so let me know if you guys would like that either on here or igtv and i will see you guys in my next video hi good morning i got my bible i got my coffee i'm ready to tackle the day something's wrong about this image though you guys know i do not drink coffee out of mugs anymore because mugs do not keep your coffee insulated for seven hours like a yeti does it normally takes me seven hours to finish my morning coffee anyway because i have two kids so let's try to chug this while we film this video i kind of want to do this ig tv style kind of podcast style kind of do it just in one take i feel like that's what you guys have really been enjoying so i wanted to make this as authentic as real as possible so this is actually the morning the sun isn't even out right now so i have no idea how the lighting looks so bright because it is dark in here um but i'm going to take you guys along with me during my bible study this morning i've really gotten a cute routine that i really have been enjoying and i don't think i've done one of these in a while i did a vlog and i kind of showed you guys my routine but kind of wanted to go more into depth and more detail about it today so i'm so excited give this video a thumbs up if you guys want more faith videos comment down below you guys gotta let me know what you guys are enjoying so i can keep doing that for you um now the way i'm gonna do this is more chilled and relaxed my husband and i actually have a podcast it's called ask for me my house and we frequently do bible studies but we do make them more formal and more in-depth so i will link other ones that we have done we did james which is a pretty short book and anytime we do these bible studies we actually split it up and jordan will lead and then i will lead so i will link those down below that we have it previously done and um those are more in-depth more formal like i was saying and we kind of like read it through with you guys so they're like an hour long which i know it seems a little bit long but when you read the bible it surprisingly goes by really fast so i'm already talking too much let's just dive in so i like waking up before everyone else um it's impossible to do anything when the kids are awake so this moment here this time the silence is the only time i'll have this until the next day so um i just enjoy doing it in the morning i'm a morning person as well um people always ask me like how i wake up so early and i've just always been like that even as a little girl i just love the mornings um and i'm a big believer in starting your morning with jesus as opposed to like the middle of the day or at night time because it really just helps guide your full day you know like i don't feel right until i do this with the lord or like i don't know my day kind of like feels off until i have this time with him so i personally just like doing it in the morning for those reasons um the only things i've been doing and having with me is my bible and i recently got a new bible so i was using one from hosanna revival that i really do like and still enjoy um but i got a new one and this one is a little bit different because it's a study bible so i've never had a study bible before and i was so upset at myself for not getting one sooner so study bible basically is a normal bible but what they do is at the bottom so i don't know if you can kind of see there's like a little line so up at the top here is just normal scripture at the bottom right here is some commentary and things explaining the scripture so this has been like a game changer because previously with my old bible i would have to stop google or pull out another commentary or pull out something else to kind of help me explain and understand what's going on so the key with the bible is context some of the context can like change everything so um this has been super duper helpful and then another thing i keep with me is this little thing this is from when i was in college i just found it in the basement so i just keep it with like pens and then highlighters and stuff um i don't use a notebook because i write right in my bible so i wanted this bible to be messy grungy loved on like i wanted her to be loved by my handwriting so i am writing directly on her i'm not keeping any separate pages to write anything else on um and this has been super helpful so i actually just started reading through the bible i wish i would have done this a long time ago i've always bounced around and like read this book and then read that book and then i've basically read every book but then i was like why don't i read through the bible now i'm reading it through the actual bible like the way it comes not in chronological order so the bible is not like the bible doesn't actually come in chronological order which sounds kind of crazy and i didn't really like realize this until recently um because we just kind of assume that it is in chronological order just by the way that you read the book but it's not so they actually do sell chronological ordered books um that you can purchase and try out or you can just look it up and like bounce around but i feel like it's a little easier to just buy the book but that's that so i'm currently in genesis and i started this two weeks ago and i um i'm on genesis 13. so i have not made it very far which is okay and i really want to take my time with it because i really want to understand what's going on so i'll kind of walk you guys through what i'm doing to help me do that um big key thing i think is just having this bible that has this information at the bottom so i'm not having to bounce around different places um and this bible is in esp so i like having i prefer esv there's nlt that i like as well so if you have a bible already maybe if you do want to get a study bible get it in a different translation so then maybe you could have both your bibles with you and read the different translations and see the different ways to do it so um i'm not gonna like read to you guys like i said i asked you guys on instagram how you wanted things done and a lot of you just wanted it more informal i don't i'm not gonna read to you but i am gonna kind of walk you guys through what i do so i kind of already explained quite a bit but now let's actually get into the reading so because i'm reading genesis right now genealogy is like super important to kind of show you and show like the reader where jesus's line comes from and where jesus comes um where jesus is how jesus's genealogy goes all the way down to him being born so when i was reading i honestly used to skip through the genealogy because i was like i don't know these people okay great they were born they had kids at this age like great but you start to realize how connected they are so just a simple thing that i do when reading genealogy and julian what julian genealogy is through the i mean there's always genealogy thrown in here and there throughout the bible so one thing that i started doing just taking my little cute little highlighter and then i will just highlight through the people that they keep talking about so for example this one right here is talking about shems descendants so it says that when shem was 100 years old he foul he fathered these names y'all is okay i don't know how i could pronounce that okay he fathered someone two years after the flood and then he lived and fathered another person and then when this person was 35 he fathered this person so basically what i'll do is go down the genealogy and like connect who birds who and then that son who they birthed because they'll kind of throw in a couple of other people in there so this way it like makes me remember what we're even talking about and keeps things connected because i easily get lost with names um i don't know if you guys are like that too but for me i lose names very frequently and get kind of lost and then you need to kind of remember these names because you'll be reading a couple chapters later and they'll mention that person again so for me it's just a easy way for me to be like who are they talking about again oh this person is this so-and-so son they came from here it just makes the bible flow so much easier so that's one thing i would do um and then because this is a study bible where's my cat because this is a study bible everything that i read right underneath has more information so what i like to do with this is i'll basically read both of these chunks so i'll read this and this and then i'll take a pause and then i'll read what's down there it doesn't always directly correlate because sometimes they'll have a little bit of extra text sometimes we'll have a lot of text but i found that just reading here through here i can stop and then i can just like keep up and see um what the bottom half has and i love using my pen um i'm not very into like calligraphy and like making things cute i know some people are and i wish i was like that um i tried being like that to be honest and for a while i felt like my jesus time was becoming like arts and crafts and it like wasn't helping me in any way because i'm just not really wired like that so for me i'm wired more in like understanding names coloring just so i can correlate who's who um highlighting circling drawing literal arrows to connect people to each other um and that's just worked for me so if you are someone who is more artsy and like can make beautiful calligraphy stuff and that really helps you learn and memorize what you're doing then all the power to you but for me that was just wasn't my thing so i definitely figure out and see like what works really well for you um so like i just said i was doing like giant arrows let me go back because i remember doing a huge arrow to connect someone's son oh okay this was one thing so in genesis 5 they talk about enoch and he says that enoch walked with the lord so then later on i was reading and the same wordage and the same phrasing was stated again and then it says that noah walks with god and i was like huh that's not a coincidence so i circled where let's see if you'll be able to see it i circled where it walked with god and i drew a little little arrow and i went over and highlighted where it was over here just so i can connect and see where it says that so what it means to walk with the lord is that he was taken to heaven alive by god like enoch and noah both did not die which is wild that was just something that i highlighted um and this also talks about this being a picture of the church and this is a common theme throughout the bible is it being a picture of the church being a picture of christ um a picture of the bride so this was something that i knew was super important so i put with little stars anyway that's just kind of what i've been doing now i should have stated this in the beginning but before even opening up my bible i always spend time in prayer and kind of asked ask the lord to guide me and to just reveal himself to me and just kind of guide my time with him and that is super important super key some days i will just get so carried away with praying i don't even end up opening my bible but every day is different some days i just sit here and do worship and listen to worship music i will link my worship playlist down below that my friend esther made it's on spotify and it is bomb it's so good and it's full of like just really amazing songs um if you've listened to christian music before sometimes they i don't know some christian music i'm very particular about and sometimes i'm like this is so cringy and then other times like the ones on this playlist i'm like oh god is good and i am just praising and cleaning and doing life and really on fire for the lord so i hope this video was helpful to you guys like i said if you want something that is more in depth and more in detail i will link all of our podcasts that we have done previously and um if you guys are currently stuck and you don't know where to read um i definitely suggest james i suggest genesis i know like some people might disagree with that but i just love seeing where everything happened like to me genesis is my favorite book because of that um i also did a free bible study on the book of ruth ruth is a very short book and it's a seven day bible study which i will link down below it's free it's just a pdf and you can print it out if you want you can pull it up on your ipad or on your phone um and just pull it up every morning and kind of read through the scripture together so that will be down for you guys as well i'm not working on it right now but i am starting to plan and think ahead of my next devotionals and so many of you really enjoyed that last one over a hundred thousand of you did that devotional which to me is just mind-blowing like i can't wrap my mind around that number um so i'm so excited and dying to do a couple of more um so stay on the lookout for that again not super recent but it is something that i've been starting to think about again and i'm very excited to do again make sure to follow me on instagram because i have been posting in the mornings sometimes like what i've been reading what i thought was cool like i was reading about the rainbow um and i feel like a lot of people don't realize that the rainbow is mentioned in the very beginning of the bible it's mentioned in genesis 9 and later that day when i had read this in the morning we were driving on our way to kalahari and we saw a double rainbow and it was the biggest rainbow i've ever seen like it looked like we were driving into it it was huge you can see the start to the finish on both of them and it was the most beautiful thing i've ever seen so that was something i shared because i was like god you are so funny i read about the rainbow can you show me a rainbow god's promise is amazing so i love you guys hope you enjoyed and i'll see my next video bye oh whoa rest whoa a cup yes we will crack them okay yes you can crack the eggs okay

you're sleeping put you right here mr army hi with you right there all right so i do her hair okay let me put some bows in your hair first let me just brush it out uh i use this function of beauty oil i use it on my hair but i use it on hers too i wash your hair every three to four days and then i do like i do like yeah i know i think i do a co-wash so i'll just like get it wet but i'll just put conditioner in so it just like putting the oil on her hands just like brushing it with my fingers my favorite thing to do has been little bows on the side without having to put little hair ties because i feel like it was kind of damaging her hair so okay elena is ready i i'm basically dressed i had a different flannel on but it kind of changed it i thought it was   this is why okay some of you have commented and asked like why the kids aren't really in the vlogs anymore and this is why i feel like i can never get a sentence out but i changed my jacket i have this one on that i got at target i did like a target haul on igtv and this was one of the things i got it's like one of my favorites but it's actually really warm today it's supposed to be in the 70s so i'm wearing shorts   he's hungry so i'm going to feed him i don't like this play room um but yeah today this weekend is my birthday weekend so my birthday is on monday so we're basically celebrating this week but today i have an eyelash appointment which i'm really excited about i've wanted to get my eyelashes done for so long i'm not getting extensions i'm actually getting them permed which i think is perfect because i curl my eyelashes basically every day i don't wear mascara anymore so i feel like this will be the perfect solution to that problem so here's mr aries outfit this little top is from kate and quinn i believe i got it from when alecia was a baby is that what it's called yeah and then his pants are from h m little stripes pants do you see it's like just got really bright but these are what my eyelashes look like naturally i mean i did just curl them but the curling like doesn't make it hold and last that long so i wanted something a little bit more permanent so i'm really excited to go these little ear cuffs i'm just gonna put in um i just exfoliated my face yesterday that's why it looks so pale but i did just put self-tanner drops on my face too but i got these little cups from tj maxx i'm gonna put them in i've been kind of itching to get more piercings but i just my piercings take a really long time to heal and it always hurts when i lay on them so let me i don't know if i should do double double or one on this side what are you doing wow when she's too quiet i start dating oh what do you have in your mouth where did you find that can i have that please no the binky thank you she is weaning off her pinky i mean i'm weaning her off her binky um god bless you she just got blessed herself but i'm weaning her off the binky so she's only allowed to have it when she's napping or like bedtime so i i collect all of her binkies but sometimes i forget and leave some of them so she'll find them yes what's this you want that bear yeah please   kids are too pure for this world all right we just went on a little walk it's almost alathia's nap time i put mr ari in this chair yes thank you you're welcome thank you um yes i'm gonna make it for you can you grab all the can you grab your bottle you can grab it from the cupboard um like i was saying i put mr ari in this high chair you guys have been following around since when alethia was a baby this is the high chair that we used for her it's just the ikea one and i spray painted the legs black and then there's this company called yeah yeah baby i think yeah yeah baby goods or something like that i'll try and find a link to it but they make really cute like little inserts and these little placemats to put so this is a cute little cover and then there's this as well it's just like a little silicone thing but i love this for when they're this age because i feel like they get tired of laying down and i don't really have anything to sit him up so i love this a lot and then he's not eating food yet but he just chills eats baby's foot oh thank you so much what about the part that goes on the inside where's that i think i've showed you guys this but i made her bottles and all her stuff easily accessible to her this is one drawer and then there's just this drawer right here that has all of her like actual cups and forks and plates and bowls and whatnot so she ever needs something she can just grab it herself um i'm gonna make her bottle she drinks oat milk and yes she still does drink a bottle the pediatrician said it's fine okay i'm getting ready to head out i normally have a verb bar but i kind of want to have coffee so i just made myself a little iced coffee with the starbucks coffee i always make i got my purse my wallet uh okay then i'll put my shoes on there like over by the door jordan is going to stay with ari alathia is down napping um she actually was crying so i went up there and she wanted me to tell him tell her everyone that loved her and i did a video a couple days ago on four things you should say to your kids every day and that was one of them and it's very soothing to her so that's what i did and she went right back to sleep so um i'm gonna take you guys off the tripod and bring you guys along and i'm really really excited a little bit nervous but mostly excited to do this oh i feel like such a cool mom with these glasses on i feel like some people might love them or absolutely hate them um but i left like 10 minutes early so i have a little bit extra time on my hands um but as i was rushing out the door and grabbing my coffee and everything i forgot to take my vitamins this morning are we surprised no but what's convenient about my vitamins is that they come in a little pack like this and you can take them with you anywhere so thank you to hero for working on today's video with me i have used them since i was five weeks pregnant with alathia i remember the first time i worked with them i filled out the quiz and i requested like prenatals and i remember my manager was like are you pregnant i was like no um because i hadn't told anyone yet but i've been taking these for over two years more than two years almost like almost like two and a half years so they come just like this and i'll insert a picture of like what the dispenser actually looks like i keep it in my pantry i'll keep it by my coffee machine it's like really cute and easy for you to just grab and go and get what you need and just open this pack and you have everything that you would need they have an online holistic quiz that you can take to kind of figure out what it is that you might need it's kind of like meeting one-on-one with a nutritionist so for me i am low in iron i like taking fish oil i'm still taking a prenatal because i just like taking prenatals after um like breastfeeding and giving birth and all of that and the packets themselves are made with eco-friendly compostable film so on their actual website if you would like to compost they have instructions on how to do that so vitamins do take about a month to kind of kick in but if you're really looking to get your health in order um and just kind of kick off the new year ahead of time like right now that'd be the perfect time to do so but if you guys want to get 50 off i will leave my link and code right here if you guys would like to try them out um and i guarantee that you guys will love it so i'll have that link down below and my code as well and thank you again to them for working on today's video with me i only work with brands that i absolutely adore and love and care of is definitely one of them so um let's head on to that appointment i have like looked into lashes before but i don't know i anytime i do something new i obviously get a little nervous so i'm a little bit nervous but i'm excited to see the results and i'm excited to bring you guys along with me so let's put some jams on jams jams jams okay low-key my favorite part about driving without the kids is being able to listen to whatever i want so i will link my apple music down below but i recently just like organized it in really cute um little things normally we just listen to the twox playlist but right now i'm going to listen to the christian rap one that i have and these are some really good songs that are not cringy like rap music um this one's currently my favorite coming in how i really like indie minio but um yeah i'll link this down below because i'm about to blast this on my drive i can't even feel it i thought i'd be able to feel it everybody says that they're like i thought it would hurt a little bit yeah like the tugging but there's like nothing nothing yeah honestly the most you feel is like if the ipad comes up a little bit it does kind of like um itch a little bit but that's it um it's just like dyeing your eyebrows but with henna so it's like a natural oh that's cool there you go i'm so excited to see how do they look really good okay i've gotten like a chance i feel like i can't like do this without like looking weird so just like ignore the angles okay i promise i don't look like this in person but because of the camera it like completely distorts my face but i also don't have any makeup on so like don't judge my skin but um that's what it looks like so she tinted them and permed them and it's like a keratin treatment so she said that the tinting will probably only last a week but i do have naturally like darker they're not like blonde um but i can't get them wet for 24 hours and this should last about six weeks so keep you guys posted i am not i i'm okay i'd like to think i'm not a high maintenance girl because i try my best to keep things simple and minimal like me adding manicures was like a big deal because i don't like doing things all the time i don't like how expensive it gets i don't like having to like feel like i have to go someplace and like it's just too much so for me to like commit to something is a big deal so i will let you guys know and keep you guys posted if i end up continuing on with this i'm really excited i was talking to her about getting my eyebrows laminated again we'll have to feel things out um but alecia

so early you can already see it's six o'clock and it's like pitch black out um but we just been playing in the playroom jordan just went to pick up some food we're gonna have five guys for dinner i cooked basically every day of this week and we ate really healthy um and i kind of just wanted to have pizza or burgers i wanted something like more junky and not as like a reward but just because i believe in balance and having both so that's what we're gonna have today and the kids are gonna be here we just have like a little movie night so i'm gonna put on my pjs and just relax and unwind with our friends i hope you guys enjoyed today's video i will link the place that i went to to get my eyelashes done down below as well as care of and thank you again to them for working on today's video i will have my link down below too um and let me know what video ideas you guys have i just posted but well today i posted the video of lathey and i baking together and you guys seem to really enjoy that you want to open this no um you want to put our spinky in there you try to get it out   but again i hope you guys enjoyed today's video i love you and i will see you in my next one here they are are you screaming because i am right it's forcing a lot of couples to like really press in together into the lord together or like really causing a lot of rift mean     foreign   try this there you go that your head stays straight all the way to your butt eight nine ten quick zip of water and back     good morning guys welcome back to my channel um people saw this in the car and thought that we were coming out with merch but could we yeah so we actually you just had these made right can you customize them on yeti how did you do it yeah i just i think we have to like buy the license for that or like oh buy the logo but we can look into that if you guys want the same girl doing your stuff can maybe help us with that yeah jordan's been training me yes i dusted off the old training sneaks and uh yeah fun fact jordan used to be a trainer when we were in high school a long time ago yeah we used to be like gym rats you should insert some pictures because then they're going to judge how i look now and then you'll be like wow you really put on a lot of weight huh it's easy it's hard to gain get and easy to lose right yeah so we kind of talked about this in our podcast which we're like blown away at how many of you are liking them and watching them since we've been posting them on youtube but we kind of like mentioned how we've been really struggling to like spend time together and sometimes when we record the podcast it's like the only time that we do spend together and i think our souls yeah i think too with just everything going on with kovid and and all that it's forcing a lot of couples to like really press in together into the lord together or like really causing a lot of rift so we're trying to like identify that and say we're not going to go down the bad route we want to just use this time as a blessing yeah but for our marriage well it's funny that you said that because we a lot of our marriage we've spent away from each other so we've learned how to do long distance and then covet happened and we had to learn how to spend only weekends together to all day every day working taking care of the kids like functioning and like doing everything together so it was a huge adjustment for us but basically jordan was like we can't even say a sentence to each other during the day because there's always a kid crying screaming there's someone here watching the kids there's someone here like to hang out there's like always people around so we decided we're gonna wake up early together and milan is a quality time love language person she loves to receive quality time so for me i'm thinking of it like well i'm spending time with her when we're going over business stuff but she's like no that's not quality time that's time together but it's not quality time so right things like going on walks or working out together or going on a date night like those are more quality uh activities that we can do together so but we've been waking up which i really appreciate that he wakes up with me because that's like not an easy test to do so we wake up before the kids do sometimes ari will be up but he just needs like milk or something and he'll go back to sleep but um right now jordan and i are about to film a video for us to post on our ask for me my house podcast page um on facebook we are revamping it so we're gonna do that real quick and then i'll leave a link down below if you guys would like to join it it's all private um and we're gonna have very exclusive content on there so we're gonna record that video right now okay i just came upstairs real quick jordan is making breakfast i just sprayed a little bit of this dry shampoo in my hair the boutique one but this specific light clean and light bare one i've never used that um but i actually just got my hair done so it's not greasy but i just like to do preventative care and then i love this texturizing spray by kristen s um i'm actually not gonna shower it's really cold in the garage so it's not like i'm profusely sweating because i'm wet um it's kind of cold so and i feel like if i don't get ready and i just like stay my workout clothes i get a lot more done so i'm gonna stay like that i'm not even gonna do makeup i actually put self tanner drops on and now i'm just gonna curl my eyelashes i did get them permed i did a vlog all about it and you can check that out um i'll link it up here so this is what they look like um i liked it it wasn't as intense as i thought it would be but if i do just like one quick little thing it's enough to keep them up so um yeah i don't know maybe i need to do something that's a little bit stronger i don't know but it's been about a week so um but i wanted to show you guys a couple of things that i got because recently i've been shopping for winter and i'm like switching out my wardrobe um and i am obsessed with the things that i found i put mr arie to jump um but i wanted to show you guys a couple of things that i got from thredup so i love love love using thread up between both of my pregnancies being so close together being pregnant and then not pregnant pregnant and then not pregnant it has just been so convenient and so easy especially during the pandemic to be able to do thrifting online they also did give me a link and code for you guys it's milena to get 30 off so before getting to the hall keep that in mind that you can get 30 off if you guys aren't familiar thredup is the world's largest online thrift store where you can easily shop through category through store through size through everything and i think what i got this time was probably the best haul i've ever had i've really gotten it down pat and i always get questions of how i find really good things so i'm gonna share my secrets with you guys because i've been shopping there so long i feel like i know their app so well so first of all definitely download the app because it makes it super easy and user friendly um and first i will kind of have a couple of things in mind so i wanted both activewear which is what i'm wearing right now actually i got this little jacket because i wanted something nice and warm and then i also got this sports bra on there and i got a nike sports bra and adidas like i found really good stuff this time so i basically started out with sports bras search through brand so zara anthropology um h m free people i like just try and find and see a bunch of different things and then i also look through shoes so i just put in my size and then i just look through all the shoes so this is my biggest secret if you find something add it to your cart and then try to see how many things you can find and then wait a couple of hours and then go back on the app again and search through again because they're constantly adding things and i'm pretty sure things will stay in your cart for 24 hours correct me if i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure that's how it goes so if you add something and then you go on a day later right before the 24 hour mark you can get a couple of other things that were recently added so it's a really good easy way to do that um so yeah that's just my biggest hack but i wanted to show you guys so first and foremost this nude sports bra that i thought was adorable let's see how much actually was and how much i paid for it because i got it for so cheap and guys i was able to find ray-bans on thredup like this sports bra that i'm wearing right here that i wore for today's workout um is from patagonia and it was originally 45 and i got it for 22. this is from zella and it was originally 71 and i got it for 30. so i have i feel like i have every style of boot except for this one and i was screaming when i found these i actually found brown ones and black ones these are from forever 21 they were originally 40 bucks and i got them for 20. i also found this top from banana republic which is a really good quality brand um this was originally 60 bucks i got it for 18 bucks oh this is so cute i got it because of the sleeves i thought that was like kind of different and unique of a top to wear cute okay i'm gonna go downstairs and grab my ray bans to show you guys because i was screaming these came in yesterday the ray-bans it and i was like no way i was shook it here they are are you screaming because i am i have wanted these for so long but i was like i don't want to spend the money like i don't like i mean i like getting designer sunglasses but i think they're so pricey and alithea ruins all of my sunglasses so i was like dude we're not doing that so these were originally 150 and i got them for 80. so like i saved a lot of money and they are and they are in the absolute best shape ever like no damage at all even came with the ray-ban um case like come on i'm gonna wear these on our walk later today and basically every day they are offering you guys 30 off with my code milena so if you've been on the if you've been wanting to try it now is the time to do it you can get some really cute things maybe even some shopping for people hi i'm gonna keep this on because like i said i feel like i'm so much more productive when i'm wearing workout clothes i don't know if anyone else can relate to that um but yeah i'm gonna keep this on there we go for when we go on our walk   jordan just made me some breakfast eggs and avocado and i thought i would just give aria a little piece i know they're not supposed to eat until six months but we started finally a lazy at four months so i cut it up like this

instagram i share this but i am supplementing um i was just not going to kill myself like i did when i had olafia to get my supply up so i tried for two weeks it worked and then i was good for a week and then it went back down i was like you know what i'm gonna start supplementing it's just so much better for my own mental health and i don't need the added stress of breastfeeding all that if your mom you know the struggle he really likes these bottles the tomo tomo tipi temutapi i'm not like i'm not that well with like these baby things anymore i was with lazy i feel like i knew everything but this time around i'm like whatever he'll take it with so this is one that he likes i feel like it best represents a boob because the his whole mouth goes over this whole thing he has a really good latch on this um so i think that's why he likes it but he also will take alathia's bottle sometimes but she does get mad so i stopped giving that to him when she's around yeah he's definitely at that drooling phase right now um i don't think he's gonna have a tooth come in but he's it's definitely like working its way up all right guys i'm getting started on gift guides i have never done them before because honestly i'm not the biggest fan of them any ones that i've seen previously i'm like dude who wants that stuff so i thought i would give it a shot and try different things i actually just started a christian a child's christian gift guide which includes some really really cute christian focused like bible focused things so i'm gonna get started on that right now um and start out a couple of other gift guides so i'll be posting them on my instagram so if you don't follow me on there i'll link that down below um as well and then if you guys follow me on like to know it i don't know if you guys have instagram or like to know it but i'm also posting it unlike to note so stay on the lookout for that but i'm eating my lunch doing that right now jordan's mom just got here so she's hanging out with ari i'm gonna do a couple of like busy work things so i thought i would close out the vlog right now but i'll leave my links to thread up down below if you guys want to get 30 off stay on the lookout for that gift guide i love you guys and i'll see you in my next video bye his year my theme is wood do you like that wood is my outfit today okay here they are why did i do that ugh i don't know hi guys welcome back to my channel with the year that we have had i feel like we are all hanging on to christmas as like our last little pocket of sunshine our last little fun thing that we do at home which i'm so excited about so i am going to bring you guys along with me to go shopping for a couple of christmas decor things now honestly i did not want to go shopping i get so tired of the consumerism that we live in i get tired of having to feel like i have to buy something every single year for every single holiday like it can get a little overwhelming but then i was like you know what this year i'll get a couple of just minimal things that i didn't have but i will shop locally so unfortunately the things that i'm going to be getting today it's not like you can just hop online and grab it as well i am going to be shop locally at places near my town in my downtown area um i will share what places i go to so if you do live in michigan you can hop and stop there too but i thought it'd be really nice and sweet to just support local businesses so use this video as kind of some inspiration and some ideas for you guys this year my theme is wood do you like that wood with a wood like what what species are we talking about here like a light wood like a like a laziest type of wood in her room you know yes you're not in the frame like that pot over there yeah yeah no that one thing right there oh yes you know so i wanted to have like wooden garland wooden what i've seen really cute ones um i just wanted some like wood accents so if you're new here i don't do christmas in the traditional red and green it's not really my vibe i really like the more muted neutral colors i have a new idea of where i want to put my christmas tree but i want to hear your guys's thoughts i've expressed the idea to jordan i don't think he's about it jordan's not about change for anything so well well i'll have to do the convincing is this thing getting chunkier do you like his hat okay quick little layout last year we have this like half sun room we put our tree here last year i liked it but the tree that we have is really like thin but really long um so it like fit in this corner well but once we started adding gifts and stuff this area became a little bit too cluttered so i actually had the genius idea of jordan would disagree with the word genius i had a thought of actually removing one of these cabinets so these are actually three cabinets so two three two um these are from ikea do you remember what they're called no you asked me what the swedish name of it is yeah like a snick lag or something like that no it's i think it's sweet it's just it's all the names are we don't know how to pronounce any of it yeah anyway i'll try to find the link i love these because they're you can customize them anyway this whole chunk will come out so i was actually thinking of removing this piece putting it probably in the garage and then putting our tree in that corner because i feel like it's so much homier won't be blocking the tv though no because it's really skinny we can try you can move it around so that's my thought if the christmas tree goes there great it'll look really cute and then i'll do all this christmassy if not it's fine we can put it over there but i like decorating this thing babe once it comes to life you'll like it it's a little christmas magic you know the christmas spirit um but we don't have a mantle or a fireplace so i kind of use this as my mantel and fireplace so i would love to put a couple of homes little houses a little i know i want to use them again and they're wooden they're not green and red they wouldn't yep and then i would love to see if i can find some fresh garland from a local shop as well like a small um flower shop or something um so i would probably remove this like i'm saying i don't like the clutter so i remove whatever current decor i have and then replace it with christmas stuff so that's key see if it were me you would just clutter it up i would just put it right on and then you'd have do you know how much adjusting that would be you'd have desert and like the little weeping willows from the side of the road with christmas stuff and that's just it's a no-go no i mean the theme i do is kind of similar to my already existing theme but you know okay here is my outfit today just have on like this little mock uh long sleeve shirt thing on i think it's from tj maxx from a couple years ago these jeans are from pacsun they're the mom jeans they're my absolute favorite i did a half i did a fall video with my kids of like what we wear in a week and i mentioned these so i'll link that video down below um this little trench coat and then these little belt bags belt bags have been like my go-to thing recently because i feel like it helps really accessorize your look and it's very practical because if i have the kids i can have this with my stuff in it and then use the diaper bag as well but then i don't have to like dig through the diaper bag for my belongings my mask and phone and wallet are just right here so it's easily accessible oh it said the airdrop declined   i just got back from one of the stores that i went to sorry about the lighting it's kind of actually really beautiful day okay hopefully that's a little bit better they had really really nice stuff oh i don't know if i mentioned this already but i am spending my monthly uh budget on christmas decor stuff this year jordan and i are actually saving up for a couple of things so we started setting budgets for ourselves um so obviously we can spend whatever we want normally i end up like buying stuff for the kids or like a manicure or something but because at christmas time i was like i'm spending my stuff on or my budget on christmas decor and jordan can't complain about it because i'm staying within my budget so um that was a long little tangent i found really cute things my goal was kind of to not have to really replace all my stuff because when i went in there they actually had displays of like vases that i looked that looked like stuff i had at home but they just took out the flower or took out the thing or whatever and replaced it with more christmassy things so that's definitely what i want to do um i am going to go to a flower shop a local flower shop to see if they have any fresh garland it might not last until christmas time but we will see and i did stop at duncan's i was in the starbucks line but starbucks here i don't know why okay it's way too bright to not have these on sorry guys um starbucks here i've never wait less than 15 minutes i don't know what it is it always takes forever so i was in the line and i was like y'all i don't have time for this so i got out of the line and i went to dunkin donuts i haven't even taken a sip yet because as soon as i got it i pulled up and i would say my thing that i missed the most about like pre-covered days was when you'd be able to like walk through a store with like an iced coffee or a coffee in your hand and like freely be able to drink it i don't know why but i miss those days because i feel like i'm always rushing to drink my coffee and so when i get to wherever i'm at i can just casually drink it but i haven't been able to do that so i'm always like in the car drinking my coffee which feels so weird let me go see if i can find some fresh garland or something fun to put in um some of my vases i actually just forgot but i have that front entryway and i have right now a cherry blossom stem it's actually two stems but they're really really big and i want to replace that with something really christmasy so hopefully i can find something that's super branchy and long but affordable makes me feel a lot less guilty though because i'm shopping small which is helping other people and that makes me feel good okay i'm gonna go now i don't like vlogging and driving it makes me nervous bye okay hi um i just called tons of different florists and none of them seem to have like fresh garland or like any christmasy type fresh things which makes me a little bit sad but i actually went to high school with a girl and she has her own flower shop and i jammed her on instagram she hasn't replied yet but i'm hoping and praying that she does at her shop um but while i wait for her to reply since i'm already out i am going to go to target i know i know it like seems like no matter how hard that's the only thing i like about this car this car is ginormous and it takes forever to back out and it's just it's really hard to park sometimes and i mean i love having the big car because i fit a lot in my car but it can be a little bit annoying maneuvering through anyway i hope you don't mind that angle i just feel weird with the camera right in front of my face because then i feel like it's a little bit distracting i like i know the angle is not the best but there are so many people on the road right now guys it's insane and they're saying that everything most stores right now everything that they have is what they're gonna have until the spring like they are not restocking their stuff which is crazy because i know a lot of people are home so they just want to decorate for christmas so hold on let me try to get myself in focus um anyway i'm gonna stop at target because i saw online that they actually have glass christmas trees like chris glass christmas looking tree things so i'm gonna see if i can snag a couple of those and then i'll get home and do a quick little haul and show you guys what i'm going to do and then not in this video but my next video i will actually do a decorate with me because i really would love for aletheia to be with me because this is going to be the first not her first christmas she was here last christmas um but it will be her first christmas where she knows what's going on so i would love for her to decorate with us but she's at my mom's house right now she actually spent the night because i have a doctor's appointment and then ari has a doctor's appointment tomorrow and one is in detroit and one is in west bloomfield which is like very far from each other and so i didn't want to have lacie um i didn't want to have alesia in the car with me that entire time because it can be a lot for her so my mom offered to have her babysit so i thought all right babysit and have a sleepover which i thought was so sweet so i took a wrap on it so lazy is that with me so next video will be lazy and i and ari and jordan decorating jordan will probably not be partaking he'll be complaining about bringing the stuff down from the attic but it's fine that's what husbands are for okay see you guys back up all right back home i'm going to show you guys a couple of goodies that i got ari is over here with a little rattle so you hear that that's what it is i went to target for some reason my card wasn't working and it kept saying to call the card company whatever so i didn't end up getting anything from target that was a huge waste of time but it's fine see you're supposed to buy from local i know jordan's like see that was that was just lord telling you to buy local the place that i went to is called 28 furniture co they are in downtown plymouth so if you are in the area they have tons of stuff like basically the entire store um was christmas stuff so   let's see i wanted mainly green things to kind of fill up some of my bases so i wouldn't have to like completely remove my base i could still use and accessorize it with so i got a couple of stems that look very realistic     okay here they are i wish you guys could feel it through the camera because it's like a sticky gooey type feel and it looks very realistic very heavy very durable so i'm really excited about this like i said i'm not going to be decorating today but i just want to show you guys what i have and then next week we will do the actual decorating so i actually got two variations of this i got this one that is on a larger stem that's more full like this and then i got two of these like little fat ones that will go in like smaller pots next thing i got was a candle and then a candle um cutter thing these i think are adorable not only like for actual use but because of the aesthetic of it i think they're really pretty so i feel like there's nothing more there's nothing that like completes a home for christmas than a candle and this one is by this kalamazoo company so it's michigan based and it smells so nice it smells like you have fresh-fired fresh wood burning   okay last things are what i went there for so my hair stylist actually went there a couple days ago she's the one that told me they had these things and it's garland the wooden beads i was talking about so i wasn't sure how many to get so i did actually get a little bit more and a little extra just to be safe but i got two variations this garland right here which is just so cute and i feel like if i don't use it around the tree i can use it in so many other areas and places at the home so i got that variation and then i got this one too which i normally wouldn't have gotten because of the gray balls but they had this on display on one of their christmas trees and it looked really beautiful so again i will try my best to like find something similar and link similar things online but i just wanted to encourage you guys to shop locally um thrift see what you can find maybe even diy these are really easy to diy um so yeah i hope you enjoyed this video stay tuned for my next one where we actually get to decorate and do all the fun stuff but i think the prepping and planning is really fun as well so i love you guys thank you for watching and i'll see you in my next video good morning i'm having like the laziest day ever and it feels so good i never really give myself lazy days i feel like every day i wake up and i'm like up and at it already so today i was like babe we're starting a new tradition and we're making it saturdays are like actual sabbath days we're just gonna chill and do actually nothing well we are still gonna do some things but like we're gonna chill i'm still in my pjs i actually got my period this morning and i'm not happy about it because i hate getting my period i'm gonna put chapstick on my lips are really really really dry i haven't even put moisturizer on and i haven't even drank my coffee yet both the kids are napping right now which honestly rarely ever happens um i did a little bit of christmas decor shopping a couple days ago that vlog is already up and i showed you guys but we've just been having kind of like a chill morning i actually brought out some of the christmas stuff already this morning and was doing it with alexia she was having so much fun she wouldn't stop spending um but she's getting really crabby so jordan put her down for her nap and i told her the tree would be up by the time she wakes up and then she can help us put the stuff up for it um but yeah i'm excited this year because she's a little bit older and i want to start doing different traditions and like different things that are really sweet and just really meaningful so one of them is like those advent calendars i believe is how you call them so gather actually sent us one yesterday and it's so cute um this is it right here so gather makes like leather goods i have tons of their stuff and i always buy it but they actually sent me this which i thought was really sweet so they are a small shop so i'll link them down below so kind of like my thought was to put like different bible verses or something in there so we open it up every day but i don't know if i want to put i don't want to put cookies or like candy in there i want to do something like sweet but i feel like the bible verse might be a little not basic so maybe i was thinking of actually like getting little trinkets or like little things that like correspond or like go along with the bible verse if that makes sense i don't even know what bible verse i want to do um i was talking to jordan about it yesterday but that's definitely something i'd like to get figured out so these are pretty large so i kind of like that we're not going to keep it here um i was actually thinking about putting it in the front over here let's see i moved that over there so that tree is normally over there where i like take most of my pictures where right there but i decided to move it over here and give her her own little moment and i think she looks beautiful so the actual olive tree i know i'm so scatterbrained we're talking about where to put the calendar but i passed through her but this actual tree is from target it's from the chip and joanna collection so it might be online still and then this pot is an outdoor pot that i found at home goods and they had tons of them and it was super affordable i think it was like 40 bucks normally planters like look like limestone like that or like in the thousands so i was so happy when i found it okay anyway i was thinking let's see   we have like our mud room right here the mudroom closet and then the garage doors right there this is the basement door jordan thought about putting it here but i suggested actually putting it right here there's just this bare wall that like leads into the kitchen this is like the hallway from the front door um i just thought about putting it right here and making it like olathe's height so she can like actually reach and grab it but yeah this is all the christmas stuff that we currently have out i have a lot of stuff from last year a couple of things that i got this year um so let me show you kind of what i've done thus far so i did this little corner these are ones that i just got from a local shop i think they're so beautiful and then i picked these up yesterday these are actually scented and fresh so i think this looks really cute i actually want to keep things pretty simple i feel like my brain right now is like very cluttered so i really want to simplify my home to keep my my soul and my mind clean so things are going to be simple um this shenanigans is all staying the same i have this so far i actually don't really like how that looks um i'm probably gonna put it back and just keep that guy i don't know i'm gonna play without round with that i don't i'm not obsessed with how that looks and then over here i have this setup which i think looks cute so uh oh what else oh this okay ignore the tags these tags are actually still on from last year i don't know why i do that i always like buy things leave the tag on so i can see if i like it if i can return it but then i never end up taking it off so i made this little situation what do we think i found these at hobby lobby and then i just put them over this and i feel like it looks really nice because this island is really tall so kind of like that it gives it some shape and then these two i got from a small shop and this smells amazing so i need to still put candles on let's see i also did i did this little front entryway so far which looks very simple yet a little flare of christmas and then in my office as well i just added that little guy and then that again i want to keep things simple i don't want to overdo it and then i'm still looking to find fresh garland to hang and drape over the stairwell because i think that looks so beautiful so um what i have left are just these little things i have these candles left i have some of these little trees um some of these guys this oh and guys i need to go buy another one because this time last year ari wasn't here so i only have three which is so sweet it almost made me cry when i did this or like when i found that we only had three because it was we didn't have ari yet i have this noel thing this thing and then this is what i did for the center so i normally have olive stems sticking out but i just replaced it with a tree this is our tree thingy that actually goes under um i put this here i think it looks nice i think i'll keep it like that and then i wasn't sure what to do over here so these are the ones that i bought this year so i left that there and then i wasn't sure if i should do this big tree like this i don't know it's kind of hard to tell i think i have to play around with it or this guy i think this guy might be too short i don't know again i'm just kind of playing around with everything and then i'm still waiting on jordan but he's gonna bring out the tree so we're gonna remove this portion we're gonna try it a lot of you liked the idea so we're gonna take this part out and then hopefully put the tree here um and then i also put these two up which i think are really cute and then for garland this year i wanted to do something really like full and fluffy so these are two two actual like garland pieces so after we have the tree in i'll play around with it and see what i want to do it's probably going to bother me because it's not going to be symmetrical because everything's going to be kind of pushed off to the side but we'll see   is   oh   see why are you listening to bear does it look   it's like as if this spot was made for that tree it looks so cute our tree is super thin that's why i feel like it fits and like looks really good is this your first christmas i bought his first christmas gift yesterday okay so now that the tree is up now i feel like i can start decorating everything else so like i mentioned before this is gonna bother me that it's not uns like centered but i think i'm gonna try to figure out a way to like make it not look as drastic but basically i decorate this part as if it were a mantel so over here i did kind of like a fake setup of what i'm envisioning and kind of want to do over there so this is basically it um maybe i'll throw in more candles or like you know what i'm saying the candles will be spread out but because we have the tree there i wanted to keep this neutral to really keep the green and the focus on the tree and then i was thinking of using these actually over by our staircase so we'll see how that looks um yeah i'm gonna play around with them   okay so far so good i think the biggest thing that actually made me not feel as stressed out this year was shopping on one day bringing everything out one day and then actually putting things in place another day so i like broke this up basically into three days because today is saturday and i started doing this on wednesday so um i feel like we're basically done so i do have stuff left that i haven't actually used yet so instead of just like shoving everything and finding a place i'm actually just gonna store it so these candles i think they're beautiful i got them a couple years back i'm gonna hang on to them just for dinners or anything fancy like that because i think they look really beautiful um lit with the candles melting i'm pretty sure that's what i did last year i just like put them in the middle of the table but i'm not gonna do that this year and i actually just bought these this year but i don't see a need for them just yet and they're actually not even really like all that christmassy anyway i feel like this could go for anything so i might just return these um but that's what is left so let me do a quick little run around um i already showed you guys this so this stayed the same i freshened and lightened this up a little bit and then i don't know how i feel about this whole corner it looks a little cluttered to me it always looks kind of cluttered but i think because that house is so big it looks even more but i loved this i thought that looks really cute but then i'm gonna have to move probably this guy out of here um like that this is here just for now um there's that guy there's this little guy he's loving the tree right now hi here's young oh wait i lied i have this little reindeer left that i still haven't used yet but this is what i decided on doing so i originally had them going in the middle and then jordan was getting upset at me because he doesn't like things blocking the tv even though it's like this much but whatever i think i actually like this better um so i put all the trees over here going like big to kind of smallish um and then i don't know how i like this just yet and then i put these here again i have to get one for ari i think once i get aries i'll center them and probably take this guy out and we'll play around with it again um and then this over here i gotta straighten it up but yeah that is all so far um the tree i'm gonna wait to complete and i'm wait i'm gonna wait on the tree until like it wakes up and then i'm gonna try to figure this out right now to put on the stairwell so i'm gonna do that quickly um and then that's what this little corner looks like but i think overall it looks very clean and sophisticated you're here ari do you want to see the christmas tree ready okay close your eyes ready close your eyes yeah three two one open do you see the two oh she doesn't even care about the change she's on cre dukes what do you think about the tree look at the christmas tree with the lights you wanna go touch it is that really decorated that's what we're gonna do we're gonna decorate the tree yeah you have a kiss for me thank you oh what about my mind coming out what does my mind get one of these too oh mean   what about me oh thank you baby   and i can't find our normal ornaments so we're gonna hang up these put it on the tree whoa that's a big bird okay i'll let you bend down a little bit squat tricks you can see your face i got a ball oh you got a booboo yeah yeah okay what do you think   all right we're getting bougie everyone's here except for delilah and cookies on i was able to put a couple beads on i have two more rows um and there's like this much left so i should be able to put them on pretty well until we find our other ornaments or we might just leave it like this what do you think i like it fair i like it simple oh twos we're gonna leave those on the tree we're going for more of a minimalist fortune too yeah okay all right cool guys hope you guys enjoyed she's rearranging everything already great all right guys i love you and i'll see you my next video hmm hey guys welcome back to my channel it's like my 15th time doing this intro because i'm trying so hard to say everything that i need to say and i feel like i keep forgetting everything i don't know why but after having ari my memory is so bad so bear with me guys i'm trying really hard here i want to make this like super beneficial i've never done gift guides before so i'm kind of nervous because i'm like i really want to help and i want to give you the good information but i don't want people to feel like i'm so all over the place so i've just been a little bit struggling so hi thank you for your patience thank you for being here it's my first gift guide i decided to do zero to two joined in one video because i have found that as ari and alathia are getting a little bit older ari is five months old now he's starting to play with the same toys that alexia kind of plays with so i want to keep things minimal and simple affordable and um easier for you moms i really invest a lot of my time in finding toys for my kids because i want to find a good deal i want to support a local brand um i think about a lot of things when purchasing my kids toys and i don't like to buy them toys all that much so the first year of lathey is life i feel like i bought so many toys and then after she turned one i haven't bought many toys at all um the only toys we get are like from the subscription box that we're subscribed to and those are like basically the only toys and she still uses stuff from when she was a year old so you can definitely stretch these out you can definitely not need to buy a lot of toys and that's why i was like hesitant on doing this because i was like i don't want people to feel like they have to buy their kids a ton of toys and all of this and all of that so i'm huge on rotation last year alathia was playing with her christmas toys and things that she got from christmas up until like this year so i don't give her all of her toys at once i mean during christmas she can open all of them and whatever but then i put them away in a closet and i bring them out one by one and i found that this really stretches everything and because we rotate her toys um and she doesn't play with all of them at the same time i feel like we definitely get a good amount of time played with these toys so quick little suggestions um of how to really get the longevity out of your toys but i basically wanted to do them into categories i'll put that time stamp here if you guys are curious or want to know but i will just say that i've noticed a lot of these toys like i said they've just been using them a lot there are obviously so many other toys out there i will link my amazon storefront that has tons of other toys that are alathias and aries but these are the ones that i found that they love and gravitate towards the most and are the most versatile so i do gravitate towards more wooden toys montessori friendly open-ended independent play types of toys because i've just found that those work really well for my kids and i love how independent they are when they play so i will have links down below so if you do shop through those links thank you for supporting me and my channel don't feel the pressure to but i do appreciate if you do um but i do want to encourage you to shop locally or shop at the thrift store i found a lot of these at the thrift store too so don't feel like you have to buy things brand new your kid will love and appreciate it either way so let's jump into it um i don't even know where to start i just have a crap ton of toys in front of me okay let's start with the baby stuff so first and foremost i just have this like little tray right here of things that i've seen that ari really likes this is not one of them this is too small for him um first any type of little rattle i like the wooden ones i think these are really cute this is from a small shop that i'll link down below um this one is from hallmark there's tons of different ones but he really likes these because he can grab them and just like they just like put things in their mouth so basically anything that will like feel good on their gums here are a couple options these little teethers are also from ryan and rose he loves these i have them in tons of different colors i bring them basically everywhere with me because they're really like easy to find and hold on to and then last thing i got these when atlantea was a baby but these are like little wooden animals they're so cute very adorable um and really easy to just like hold again chew play with whatever and then last thing is this little guy right here he loves this i'll put this in front of him and in front of like his um like when he's like propped up on something and he'll just play with it and try to grab it put in his mouth it's really cool and i'm like very infatuated by it sometimes but these i have found have been the simple things that he uses and loves a lot all right last thing before moving on to the pricier items and that is this ribbon stuff so i've mentioned these before i suggest these but also like actual silk ribbons i don't know where mine are i think they're downstairs but i suggest those they're so fun to like play with and throw them around on your baby if you have other kids they can like play with them it's like good for sensory and color um and for them to see like movement and then i really like these as well so this is kind of like a diy thing this was like um this was like a banner from target it came on like a little piece of string like this they were like different colors and i just pulled it right out and kept them in chunks like this so he loves these he'll just sit and like play with it i just like put it around the sound is nice like the feeling is different and he really enjoys these and this is really affordable so those are my affordable options for zero to six months now i'm going to show you two things that are more on the price to your side but again can be used for a very long time so first thing is this play mat this is the love every or loverly i'm not sure how to pronounce it this is their play mat i had one for alethia and one for arie we love it so much it's so cute i don't have the attached thing right here because we just use all of it and use it a lot um but it's great to just have them lay down to do tummy time i feel like both my kids started rolling over earlier than normal because they were in this all the time and like wanted to reach things and grab things there's like a little ball right here that they can play with so i really enjoy this and so do my kids and then the last thing of this category is this jolly jumper i don't have the top attachment to it but we do have the one that goes over the doors um they also do sell it in like a stand i personally opted for the door option because we have a lot of door jams in our house and i feel like the stand would be too big and bulky and kind of hard to like put away so this is why i like this one but basically it's like a little thing that they just like sit and jump he'll stay on this thing for like 15-20 minutes he loves it and we really enjoy it and he can use it when he's older you can put things under their feet so it like makes noises or like tickles or something really easy fun toy for the kids so i will have those linked down below let's kind of just move on to basically six months until 24 months um these i feel like they can play with at any stage so let's kind of start with the more affordable things um i'd say instruments so i love instruments i found all of these at the thrift store alathia and ari both really enjoy these um you can find them at the thrift store i will have a link to amazon down below but i love having some type of instrument in her rotation where i have different types of instruments that she can play with and she'll just like walk around and have her own little little music party and she just really enjoys them music is so good for kids so i think any type of instrument situation the kids will benefit from and will be able to use for a long time next thing is a puzzle and i feel like puzzles and books are like a go-to if you don't know what to get your kid or if someone is asking you what they should give to your kids puzzles and toy puzzles and books those are like my go-to but more specifically a customized puzzle so this one is from an etsy shop we are missing her l i don't know where it is but um alexia's grandma actually got this for her for christmas last year and i think it's so cute it's just a nice little puzzle something that's more customized um a little bit like cute you can put this in their room but again it's really good puzzles are amazing for kids alithea loves this one because she knows it has her name on it um but a great option all right another toy is this right here so this was one of valencia's favorite toys when she first started learning how to sit up so i'd say around like six or seven months and it's still her favorite toy now i have it in her rotation this week she loves it it's basically you just like putting things through the hole it's really good for them learning fine motor skill colors um and it's just a really great toy i feel like they have these everywhere i got this one from the thrift store i'll link some other options down below but a great toy that is just very versatile next up these are probably one of my favorites because how versatile they are these all are kind of versatile but ari likes playing with these but alafia loves these too so they're basically little suction things well i don't know if they'll suction this normally yeah no normally we do it on the windows so i have this in her rotation this week i have um i actually put a little mirror so she's she's suctioning it onto the mirror or she can do it in the window um downstairs in our sun room i used to put this and ari likes to just like chew on this so a really great toy they love to like pull on them it makes different sounds you can like get it to stick to your body parts i used to like stick it on my forehead once and i had this giant hole in my head not whole but like a bruise and for the longest time i was like what the heck is this and then i realized it was because i was sticking this on my head so it's fun cute little toy it's colorful they're like squishy great toy so i guess we're these are more of the affordable ones so let's like keep with this pattern real quick um next thing are flash cards alathia loves flash cards and i'm talking like the classic flash cards like this but i've also recently found these on amazon and i love these so much and so does aletheia these are the numbered ones they have letters and they have common themes they have different types but these are so well made the quality is really nice they're really cute i keep one in my car i keep one in her playroom we have them kind of all over the place um because it's just fun to like kind of look through i'll tell her the numbers and the names and then we will play with these in the car so i'll do an activity with her where i'll ask her to find the cow so i'll hand her this entire stack and she'll like go through and find the cow and says i find it and then i'll tell her to find the bunny and she'll like go through and like look for the bunny and we'll play with us literally for hours in the car if we have long drives so i really really like these okay last toy that is a little bit more affordable are these i don't even know what these are called i found them on amazon and they are a hit so ari likes these because he likes to put them in his mouth i have to keep an eye on him though because they are pretty small but alathia likes these because you can stack them on top of each other so this is really good for fine motor it's kind of just like building blocks um and it's just fun they're colorful really easy to do she made a stack that was like up to here the other day and she loves these so these are a really good toy for them to play with as well okay now i have a couple of wooden toys that i'm going to show you guys because most of these some of them have been more plastic which i don't mind but i do try to keep things a little bit more wooden so next up is kind of like object object permanence boxes and those sorts of things um she really really likes these so this these this one is from love every but they are on amazon but it's basically a ball and a thing like this and they're supposed to put the ball in here and then like move this thing around so this is a really great toy it is more of a toy for when they're a little bit older i'd say probably older than eight months where they can like hold things and like put it in places um but this is a great option and then also this one i don't know where the coins are but it comes with four little coins and they're supposed to learn to put them in here so definitely when they're at least a year old they can pull it out put it back in she loves this a lot um again ari wouldn't be able to play with this maybe like with this ball but great great toy next up for the older kids would be this so this is basically connect four this one is from loverly but it's so good guys she really really enjoys this you can just get connect42 but basically the game is it's not really like most it's not really like to use as a game it's more so like for figuring out fine motor skill of getting those in there in the correct color correct form and all of that so this is definitely more of a challenging game so if you find that your kid is more advanced and can do these this will definitely challenge them and they'll really enjoy that um and then last thing of this category is this little fish game and this is the cutest thing ever it's so much fun so it basically has a little magnet and you like catch a little fish and there they have like the alphabet on them and it's really sweet there's two little things that come with it so you can play with them she will play this for hours and she'll just take them off and then put them back in and then put them on in fact all day long so this is a really great easy little game um if you do have little ones so just be cautious of this because it is a little bit on the small side so those are those wooden things um now a little more of the pricier things um and that is a little stuffed animal this is from cuddle and kind so for every doll that they sell they donate 10 meals so i think that right off the bat is huge and they have the most beautiful dolls this is the smaller one they also have a larger one my mom got a lathe one for her first christmas when she actually wasn't even born yet i think i was pregnant with a lady and she gifted it to olivia um but it's just really sweet so if your kids are more into like the little play things i really really enjoy this okay let's um okay wait one last thing and that is train tracks i actually found these train tracks at ikea train tracks are very pricey and i didn't realize until i like started looking into them but these from ikea are really nice i have two sets put together but it comes with like this and then it comes with like these little cars so i will also link that down below but now moving on to the larger items um first i'll start with the most affordable one and then we'll work our way up so first thing is this tunnel this casually throws a tunnel over herself but i have this out because this is actually part of alethia's rotation this week so this is just a little basic tunnel it's so cute and it like folds up if you need it to but alifia loves it so i definitely recommend this for kids that are starting to crawl because they can like crawl through it they can play with it they can roll around with it the dogs can play with it ari loves to just stare at it so that's really fun for him um but it's a really cool little toy so this is definitely the most affordable of the larger ones that i have um now let's move on to the bigger pieces so table and chairs ikea has two different ones one which is over here i'll insert a video of it but it's a more basic table really cute perfect for coloring for arts and crafts um adorable little chair if they like to eat by themselves and then ikea also has a sensory table and we use this one a lot so it has like two little cutouts where you can put bins inside of it to do sensory play it's really nice and easy to keep things like in one spot um i really have enjoyed it and longevity has worked really well we've painted and gotten it wet and it's withhold so so far so good so those are more on the pricier side i think the first one is like 20 bucks i think the other one is probably 60 or something i can't remember it's been a while since we bought it i'm telling you it's i like haven't really had to buy that much um next larger item is a little kitchen so there are tons of kitchens out there some really affordable ones and really expensive ones so i would just kind of see the type that you like um ours is from cocoa village and then i actually painted over it and i love the way that it looks and it's adorable she uses it a lot it's really cute it is pretty small though i already feel like she's starting to get big for it but she does play with it and use it a lot next two items are definitely more on the pricier side and one of those is a learning tower so this is probably my most used item like ever my mom and dad got it for her for christmas or maybe it was for her birthday i think goes for her birthday and we use it so much we use it every single day it's basically just a tower that's the same height as the counter so she can like climb up inside and she's like at the counter height she can cook with me she can play she'll eat on there she uses it so much it's not really a toy but definitely like a useful thing to have in the house with a toddler and then last thing is probably the most expensive one but to me it was like an investment that i knew we would use a lot and it's not limited to this age and that is the pickler so i basically describe it as like an indoor play playground toy like it's basically just something that they can climb on top of i also have a slide i also have the other piece there's like different variations that you can get um they do run on the pricier side but i was able to find these on etsy it's a local shop so you're supporting a small business um but this is what jordan and i gifted her for her birthday last year so a lot of these i feel like people like my at least our family like loves to give some of the bigger things but they'll go in on them together so like both grandparents will buy it or like the cousins will all buy it or the uncles you know like they'll all kind of like go in on a gift together so i think that is really sweet so definitely use this a lot i will say the first year of her life though she didn't really like care that much about it she would like try to go up on it but it wasn't until like probably a month ago maybe a little bit more than that that she actually started to use it and climb it it is a little bit scary so she like will get scared when she gets up to the top and she's like my and then i'll like help her and hold her hand or she'll go down the side or whatever but it's been really fun to see her like experimenting and being brave and courageous and like trying this so i will have it in this one linked down below again these are like the most used items the things that i feel like my kids really really enjoy and use a lot um i will just say that if you have family that wants to like buy gifts for your kids i have a couple of suggestions so obviously we're very thankful for whatever gift someone gives us like i will never like say like no my kid won't play with this type of thing like i am thankful for whatever they give my kids but if they do ask what toys i'd like to give them um i normally do have a list and in previous years i actually made a registry for alathia but this year the iphone like updated the notes and if you list it and like make your notes as like it's a checklist so like with a little bubble you can actually share it so that's what i did this year i made a small little list of couple of things for the kids and i shared it to everyone so that if someone buys it they can just check it off the list and then everyone else will see that someone else got it so it's like an easy way to not get duplicates but i just thought i would share that so if someone does ask you you can create a registry share the notes um and of course we're very thankful for anything that they give to our kids but if you do have more particular things that i feel like is an easy way to do that so hope you guys enjoyed i hope this wasn't too all over the place i will link tons of other toy options and these down below as well but i really hope you guys enjoyed this let me know if you end up getting any of these things for your kids or if you have other things on your kids list on instagram i will be sharing alathia and ari's christmas list as well so definitely make sure to follow me on there but i love you guys and i'll see you my next

this morning um but i did just run to target really quick because i do have a very exciting photo shoot today for my merch that is launching this week it's going to be launching on december 4th and so i have a photo shoot today and i honestly don't wear makeup all that much so i did go to target and just grab a couple of things i got some like false eyelashes so i wanted to do my makeup a little bit nicer than i normally do so i went and got that both the kids are up and dressed ari is finishing a bottle lacy is playing over there we're getting breakfast started jordan's feeding the dogs and i just sat down and wrote my to-do list for the day so this has been a game changer i got this really cute little to-do list from amazon it's honestly pretty big though i have like four days do you want to read this um i have like four days of to-do lists on here because it's like a really big piece of paper so you want to read this one too okay pause i need to read her book baby goofy catches a

bottle ready for ari and head on over oh my gosh it's so cute so the only thing hang on a second hang on does that say molina yeah that's so cute i was like that is not the label yeah   me okay i'm back home and i wanted to do an official reveal of the merch you kind of already saw a little bit of it but here it is it says a lion of judah this is something that is mentioned all throughout scripture time and time again i absolutely love the look of a graphic tee but some graphic tees just don't have that much meaning to it so i kind of wanted to create something that was super cute versatile had meaning a great conversation starter and this is what i came up with so i'm so excited it is going to be launching on friday december 4th and i will have all the links down below this is a collaboration with fan official merch so i have that down below it will also be available on my website which is justmelenaci.com i'm so excited to be working with fan official because they are made in the us they are sustainable so each order is made as it comes in so nothing goes to waste they are so good with how they recycle and the ink that they use everything i loved everything that fan officials stood for that's a big key reason why i decided to move forward with them the t-shirt has like that perfect like worn-in grungy like t-shirt that you've had for years that you just like throw on and it's so comfortable and it just goes with everything so this is the first option so it's the cream with the brown print um i love styling it with basically anything i've noticed it looks so good so i'm actually wearing a large right now a large is perfect if you like that oversized look but not something too oversized i also have an extra large and it fits really well too i like the extra large when i'm wearing biker shorts or want leggings and like want to cover my butt this is how the large looks on me and then the extra large just goes down a little bit more and you can easily crop this if you want you can tuck it in you can do this little moment like there's so many things you can do with this t-shirt you can roll up the sleeves as well to like make them look a little bit more cuffed the material is just so nice that it like looks so good with everything so i am going to show you guys the darker version as well so we're launching this color in a t-shirt and a hoodie which i'm very excited about and then we are also launching this darker color but i wanted to show you guys the label of this one because look my name is on it and i think it's such a cute little custom look so here's the darker version basically the same thing just in a darker color but i feel like they are each they are each like so different and looks so good styled with so many different things so i wanted to throw that one on and show you guys real quick as well here's the dark gray version so it's like a really pretty gray color it looks really cute with leggings or like anything

have links down below to everything and launch is on friday and i will see you guys then okay i have about an hour until i have to pick up alethia from her grandma's house ari is over here just playing and chilling on this mat um what's up dude hi hello so i'm probably gonna pull this over into my office and answer a couple of emails and do just like random things i have to do this is why i always write stuff down because i feel like i already forgot everything that i had to do i am filming this vlog so i can check that off i just filmed stuff for kiwi and code that i'm gonna send in that's the ig story i was telling you guys about that i had to post um okay so i just sent in that i had the photo shoot i've supposed the stuff for ig i have to wait for that to get approved i need to quickly do the facebook post for the private group so i kind of he just rolled all the way over i already have in mind kind of what i wanted to talk about so in my mind i kind of have an idea so i'm going to write that all out and then actually well i'm going to write out all the stuff that i want to post for the facebook page and then i'm going to send it over to jordan for him to approve it um i need to still edit the podcast i already emailed the merch and then i need to approve all of the logos and um homepage for my website so i'm gonna try to get as much as i can get done and then i'm not actually going to cook dinner tonight because we still have so much food left over from thanksgiving so thank god i already have that situated that i won't have to cook um and then i was doing laundry this morning so i gotta finish up that too and put that stuff two fold oh you're so mushy mushy looking missing missy mushy mushy okay let's play over here   okay so mr still needs to take another nap but he just scratched himself in the nose even though i just cut his nails um so he's just kind of going through it today it's been really hard because he's five months old and i haven't really been able to get him on a schedule just yet his i tried to get him to do three naps a day but they're kind of inconsistent they're like ranging every time sometimes he'll take a longer one sometimes it's shorter so it's been really difficult and i've been having to basically just work once the kids go to bed he doesn't have a strict bedtime and he doesn't sleep through the night yet but once i put lathey down and then he'll like do a little cat nap and sleep for a little bit too that's when i try to get more things done um but yeah that's just been happening a lot more but i know that it's just a season and that once he gets a little bit more scheduled it'll be easier to get a lot more done during the day because i've been trying to work here and he's screaming at me and he's getting upset and he's supposed to be napping but he doesn't want to know so you just want snuggles um and it's almost 5 30 it's 5 18 and i just texted jordan's mom and she said that lathey is actually still napping so i asked her to wake her up by 5 30. she actually said she would come and drop off felicia so i won't have to go pick her up so that will save me a little bit of time um so i'm going to do a couple more minutes i probably have like 15 more minutes of stuff to do and then i'm going to get started on dinner and kind of see what i can toss together from the leftovers we have and then once the kids go down to bed then i'll finish up everything but i'm so excited to see the videos and pictures that esther ended up taking today and i can't wait to show you guys   i'm having zero luck with his nap but i'm gonna change his diaper and i wanted to show you guys this little hack in case any of you have kids that are still in diapers um i have this little basket right here that i keep in that cupboard which is like in our living room area and this saves me so much time from having to go upstairs and change the diaper and like it's just makes my life a lot easier so i have this mat right here from beck beck and jet it's like a really nice leather one gather also has one that's similar the gather one is actually a little bit smaller but i love this because i put them in the crack of the couch and then i lay this down i've never gotten poop on my couch um i have gotten pee though because he pees on me sometimes but it makes it very easy and convenient and then i also keep their wipes and then their diapers and can you believe that ari and alaithi are almost the same size diaper ari wears a size three and a lacie is a size four and sometimes if i forget ari's diaper he'll fit in a size four and it works out just fine so um that's why i keep in there and then i use these amazon element wipes i get them delivered every other month and it's a pack of six i believe and it's perfect i never have to buy wipes because it just comes and gets delivered and i'm pretty sure you save like five percent or ten percent when you do the subscription so i'll have that linked down below but these are my absolute favorite wipes and then my favorite diapers are these huggies i've always used huggies these in particular the little snugglers and then alathia has the little movers hi we can leave saturday the 26th and stay till friday the first if you want you filming this i wanted to get ari's little face no he had sweet potato he had it everywhere except for in his mouth rolly where are you who baby who are you no i here is your baby in your room leave it it's like a picture that's breaking your face you're gonna take a picture okay i'll take a picture and hold it okay can i be in the picture too no no no no you see lila in there did you see me in there too yes this is that side this is that side you see the slide in there too all right guys it's been a couple of hours alithea is down we did our nighttime routine with her um when she got home she was having some pretty big feelings so that was a whole thing to deal with in itself but it's been quite the long day i will have my launch day linked down below as well as the website for you guys to check out but i hope you guys enjoyed today's video um we're gonna see how ari sleeps this is already his second battle he did fall asleep in his career but then he started like screaming and he pooped and then he woke back up so he did perfect i feel like it was 7 15 7 20. he was taking his whole bottle and was getting super sleepy and then all of a sudden i've laid him down five minutes later he's screaming his head off yeah so he's just not ready to be trained and that's fine we don't need to sleep anyways i know it's it's been really rough he's almost six months he's like five and a half months or something like that and it's been like five and a half months like no sleeping at all no it's like really starting to catch up can you see how dark my under eyes are like we're over this so yeah i will have all that stuff linked down below i'm very excited for launch day keep up with me on instagram because i will be posting more details um and reminders and all of that so i will see you guys in my next video welcome back to ask for me my house guys i'm elena and i'm jordan and i apologize for my dance moves or lack thereof if you're watching oh yeah i was starting to think we should change the intro song to something a little more vibey we will on season four and speaking of we'll just go ahead and announce it now that we're going to do an episode today obviously or else you wouldn't already know about this and then not next week but the following wednesday i believe it's the 23rd it's the day before christmas eve that will be our last episode of season three end of the year basically very true and we're gonna be back i wanna say sometime in the middle of january i have to look at the calendar and the schedule but we'll be off for a few more weeks and just getting things refreshed and revamped and revived we're changing up this setting gonna judge it up a little bit if you watch on youtube or if you watch our videos first of all i got dressed today for you guys i feel like i'm always wearing a hat my hair is always so greasy and so dirty and i'm wearing sweatpants for you guys um we're gonna change our setup so honestly i'm not the biggest fan of this setup it's just convenient because that's where the computer is but we're gonna hop over onto the other side where we have a nice cozy leather couch it'll just be a lot more cozier and i think for us yeah we got our cow up there a picture of our cow i don't know if she'll be in the frame um but yeah we're going to change up the settings so we're a little bit more comfortable i feel like the conversation will be a little bit more comfortable and chillaxed um but yeah we're excited today we're talking about influencing and who influences us and how we influence people um we're not gonna make this about like influencers we're gonna take it a little bit deeper than that um but we're gonna talk about what scripture says about influences who's particularly influenced jordan and i as parents as husband and wife in our spiritual ways our style i wanted to throw in who's influenced my style because i've followed quite a few people who do um but yeah we're just gonna kind of all around talk about that so on youtube now you can actually timestamp did you know that yeah i actually saw somebody i think it was like our first or second video on youtube uh they put like the entire show time stamps like here's where we talk about this topic cause we're talking about that i'm like that's dedication girl we need to get you on the payroll but uh so we are gonna time stamp the video specifically on youtube and then i'll give it to jordan he'll put it in the description box of wherever you listen to it if it's on apple or itunes yeah it'll just be super convenient to kind of yeah because we do tend to get a little scatterbrained we do tend to have to keep feeling like some people like that though because they don't want to i mean it's conversation but sometimes i'm talking i'm like what am i talking about right now so you want to keep it together we can balance it a little bit more i'm sure but yeah yeah like melinda said we want to talk a little bit about this whole idea of influencing and we live in the age of influencers right with social media and celebrities and just news at your fingertips with your phone i don't think we realize that information yes it's it's it's definitely information overload and as i was just kind of pondering i get like lost in deep thought sometimes like when i'm sitting on the toilet or when i'm in the shower i'm just being honest and i start thinking of things like really in depth right so promise i won't rant i'm not complaining i want to hear what you have to say what do you think about when you poo putty well many deep insightful things but um none the least of which are this idea of people being influencers right and i'm like okay there's so many people there's so many accounts with the little blue check marks and things like that you have one actually which is cool i've applied for one and i've been denied many many many times but it's okay um i'm just thinking like there's all these people out there that literally most of us will never know or meet or like have an in-person conversation or interaction with yet they have such control and i use that word intentionally on purpose control over how we dress the things that we like how we spend our money even like emotions right and how you feel about certain things that's true influence right that's people having such power and control over us and it's passive it's not like they're necessarily intending to like okay i'm gonna do this but there are people i i feel like maybe they do think i don't know i can persuade all these people or i can get you know all these people on board to follow me use their platform for an agenda or use their platform for wrong reasons right to be disingenuous but i know you have felt the weight at times of just how many people hundreds of thousands of people that are watching you that are listening to you that are doing things because you told them to and they're telling you like how do we know this why is because they told you because of you i do this or because of you i did that right which is a my hands touch my hands i am sweating from the hands dripping dripping sweat that yes it is a very i don't want to say strange because like this all is like a double-sided sword like in one way it's so beautiful and can influence in such a good way but with the other hand it can be very deadly or not deadly but you know what i'm saying like it can have the negative effects on the negative side and i always tell jordan like i try not to look at the numbers i try not to pay attention to that because i know a lot of influencers whose self-esteem is wrapped around numbers and like if their numbers are doing low they don't feel good about themselves whatever so i try not to avoid that but at the same time like it tells you how many people are watching and i think the first time that it really hit us was when we had my first meet and greet yeah a year and a half ago or something like that alyssia was like three months old i think um pre-covered days but yeah that was when people actually showed up because i thought maybe two people would show up like we really thought we would be doing nothing all day but it was just like people ever like it was insane so yeah um do you want me to dive into this right now or do you want to save that for later well yeah i was just the reason i brought it up is because i know a lot of times we on the like influenced and are feeling the same way about a lot of things yeah like we elevate people to this platform of wow look all these people that are following them they must have such you know nobility or importance or whatever right but we don't really hear all the time so much from the influencers perspective right if we were to turn the table michael scott well well well how the turntable is but uh i look he didn't know that was wrong until jordan told me that was wrong we have a whole list we're planning on doing an episode just a little side note yeah we're going to do a whole episode on melania isms like words that she mixes up and i don't want to give them away i don't want to give you guys examples because there's just so many good ones in there that we want to save and stock them up but there will come a day in in the future where we'll do a whole podcast on things molena thinks our words or the right context and she's completely wrong and i love it i love it about her it's all in good fun it's humbling isn't it yeah there was this account that i followed and if you guys are on our private facebook page i shouted her out or her name is ali um yeah yard i'm not sure it's not last name but she has an instagram account and it is like all scriptural she is just so on fire for the lord and it's been so encouraging to see her but she actually made a post about um people specifically elevating christian youtubers or christian influencers and she was saying that just because someone is a christian and has a following does not mean that they should be preaching does not mean that they should be like speaking on certain things just because someone has a platform does not mean that they like the lord has wired them in a way to speak or given them that pastoral um it's a gifting yes just because they have an influence doesn't mean they have the gift of speaking and that spoke so deep to me guys because when i first started off that's what i thought i had to do i thought okay the lord gave me a platform that means i have to preach or that means i have to talk about these topics that i do not know anything about so if i made a video about this of like why i don't make faith related videos anymore um and why our podcast it just takes us so long to do episodes because we really want to make sure what we're preaching is true and is biblical and everything like that so there's an element of study and discipline and yeah prep that goes too so i don't know that post recently just really spoke to me and it's really true because people love when there's a christian and they're like oh you have a platform use it to do this and it's like well uh it's not that simple yeah you know and that's the thing too with you specifically and i don't want to this isn't going to be all about me no no i'm just i'm just using you as the example because obviously you're my wife and this is our podcast but yeah um i just know that the way you see like the term influencer it's so much more than just somebody who gets you to buy products or follow their life around it's for you it's a it's a role that you you recognize first that god's put you in second off that you have used to impact people for all the right reasons it's i was in depression or i was far from god or i didn't even know the lord and watching your video like we get stuff like this all the time guys i'm not i'm not even embellishing here and if you're watching or listening and you've sent us messages like that you know um that i speak the truth when i say that people we don't even realize how many people mulan has touched and the lord has used uh her to encourage and to reach out to people so keep it up honey good job i think of like the thief on the cross that repented and asked jesus to remember him when he entered into paradise and he says you'll be with me on this day in paradise and the reason i bring that up is because there's never any way to know as christians how our lives and how our uh our our walk with the lord will impact other people right until we get to heaven and i think oftentimes people will say well that thief had no ministry he had no opportunity to go and you know be obedient to the holy spirit and to walk in sanctification and doing good works right but think of how many people have heard his story and realize it's not too late for me i can still with my last few breaths or i can still in my final moments be saved and think of how powerful that is and i will i would be more surprised if this did not happen but i have a strong feeling that when we get to heaven we'll know the thief and see all the people that his life impacted me in the hundreds of thousands in the millions and the billions potentially that all in their final breaths as that veil between this world and eternity got thinner saw and heard his story and said there's still time the lord can still save me before i leave right yeah so same way we don't know who who all you've affected we don't know the extent of it but we will know one day in heaven and so as we're on this idea of influencing for you it's so much more than that right you don't have to be a quote-unquote influencer to influence either exactly and everyone's an influencer yes we all are influencer even if you have 100 followers those are still a hundred people you are impacting if you're a mother you have the biggest influence over your children it is insane mothers are the queen of influences we are the queen bees of influence okay um spouses or if in your church your friendships like everyone has a position of influence which is why i think the word influencer i used to really not like that term it literally used to make me cringe but now i kind of like it because it gives everyone power of influence because unless you live under a rock you influence someone you have younger siblings you're influencing them you're a youth leader at a church like you said you know you're a camp counselor at a camp or something your co-workers yeah whatever capacity you're in you have the potential to lead and to also serve as your leading people right and also to follow and people that are above you are in different positions right yeah so which leads me to my next thought is that you can influence people who are over you or older than you right like think of how many times your mom has said wow i learned this or i didn't know that you know and there's times where my mom and my dad have even come up to me and been like yeah you've taught me something right or alathia alexia has taught me so much yeah and there's so much that you can be influencing you can learn and i have a sense if you're looking at it through a spiritual lens it's god's way of reaching something in you that you might have not received had it come from somebody else right yes can i get off on a tangent go ahead i get i get one tangent i really have to pee okay go ahead i'll go on my tangent real quick jordan's been drinking a lot of liquids here we got we're not trying to be organized have you noticed how like messy our table is but i'm here for it i feel like joe rogan because his setup is a hot mess um wait babe what were you just saying oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so jordan was just mentioning like how god can use different people to reach you and i feel like most of the time when he does do this it's someone that you're close with so it's just sometimes it really gets me down when people try to criticize me over certain things but they have no idea who i am as a person and they expect me to like completely change my life around that one comment that they make um it just doesn't make any sense because i feel like the lord will use people in my life to reach me in a certain way or to um you know i'm saying like the lord will use people within my circle or within my world not necessarily like a youtube comment that's like a hate comment that was just a tangent because every time i see a hate comment i'm like how do you think this is going to be perceived well sorry tangent is done i caught some of that but well i was just saying that like sometimes people think comments will like change my life 180 but it's like god would use someone else that i personally would know or some other way yeah it's oftentimes we reject the message because of the messenger instead of just the message i can't claim that that's from ravi's account i like that a lot but yeah i think i think there's an element to god using others to influence us but it's really at his direction within his sovereign plan and i think too as far as like who is influencing us and who is influencing who we see this a lot in scripture yeah um people being influenced for the right reasons for the wrong reason so i just want to take you guys um in the next couple minutes through some scripture on what the bible says about influence and being influenced so i want to start off with samson and delilah not our dogs although they are named after these two characters but if you don't know the story samson was a judge of israel back in the day he was known as a man with superhuman strength that god gave him this gift of abnormal strength where he was able to kill lions and rip them in half and kill ten thousand people with a donkey's jawbone just a very fierce warrior and had this gifting right but it was he was god told samson's parents don't cut his hair let his hair grow long and if he did then the strength would go out from him so never cut his hair and did all these amazing feats and all these things and he wasn't perfect by any means i think that's a big misconception too another side note for another another episode but just because something's in the bible doesn't necessarily mean it's all how we ought to be living a lot of things are for our example when people mess up or people do something wrong it's like well david committed adultery does that mean because that story's in the bible we should go do that it's like no right well just haven't done their it shows that the lord uses imperfect people yes and that's that's the story of all of us right literally yeah so back to sampson he had his share of struggles and of downfalls and of um mess-ups but the biggest came from when delilah who was a seductive sexy lady comes along and she's part of the enemies of israel and she tries to get sampson to reveal to her his secret of how he's so strong and how he's so mighty and he doesn't do it at first but then he tells her if a razor touches my head like cuts cutting his hair then uh his strength will go out sure like rapunzel exactly i watch tangled like four times a day so it's just that's stuck in my head i'm pretty sure rapunzel and samson are the exact same story are you serious oh wow wow wow but yes there's there's similarities there with the hair cutting yeah anyways so when you look at the story here uh i'll go ahead and spoil it if you haven't heard it but a lot of people i'm sure familiar with the idea that samson sure enough delilah cuts his hair off and the philistines the enemies are coming around to attack him and they take him slavery they gouge out his eyes and they hold him up in chains at the uh city hall like the main pillars the foundational pillars of the entire city and sure enough his strength goes out but it wasn't his hair that gave him the strength remember that was the symbol but it was god's spirit who gave him strength and in the very last last-ditch effort of samson's life he asks god to send his spirit on him one more time so that he can destroy these wicked people and die with them and so he's chained up to the pillars and he gets that one last off of strength pulls the pillars down and the whole city comes toppling down on on all the enemies so he took out more philistines in that one day than the rest of his life put together but um i bring that up because samson was influenced was he not and the darkness which delilah represents is not always like something very blatant and obvious like oh that's bad deceitful the enemy is so deceiving he looks good he smells good satan's not gonna come in a um repulsive or off-putting manner he's gonna be that good-looking guy or good-looking girl and i'm not saying necessarily embodied right i'm not saying like physically he comes like that i'm just saying the the spirit of it's attractive that is what is influenced it'll take people he knows how to pray on your weakness right it's like i think i brought this example before but tony evans has a great talk on the spiritual realm and he says the if if you're familiar with the game of football american football no real football it just offended a bunch of people foot ball is with the foot foot you ball please continue american football the real football is but i guess this can apply to any any type of uh sport but what you do is you have the team watch film on their on their opponent to watch their patterns and watch their tendencies and see what they do so they can identify weaknesses in their play and then they can capitalize on that and you know combat that weakness and hopefully win right same thing in the spiritual realm the devil and his evil forces are watching film on you and me and see our weaknesses see our tendencies see what we do and what we're prone to or we're vulnerable to being influenced and will attack us in those things so if you just have by by your sinful nature very greedy person or if you're prideful prideful or maybe sexually or lustfully inclined right cheating there's all these attacks and temptations that the devil will throw at us why because he knows our weaknesses right so he knew samson's weakness delilah comes and i love what our pastor said he said that when you love the wrong things with your heart you'll think the wrong things with your head and you'll do the wrong things with your hands so it all stems from the heart right and it's so deceitfully wicked the bible tells us that nobody can understand the heart it's it's so wicked and here i think we see that progression in samson's life too right he was going after delilah she led him astray it ultimately led to his downfall but what i think is very encouraging in all of this is if you actually go to hebrews 11 there is a the hebrew's love is considered the hall of faith chapter which is like hall of fame kind of play on words where you have all these people that the writer of hebrews paul if you're spiritual that's a joke bible joke but i don't get it so the right nobody really knows who wrote the book of hebrews a lot of people think it was paul but there's no like actual someone who signed it so it's kind of left up to conjecture and speculation but people say paul if you're spiritual meaning like if you really believe you're extra christian now that i explain the joke it's not funny anymore but i don't think it was in the first place anyways you get to hebrews 11 they're talking about all these people abraham noah um sarah so on and so forth moses right all these people who were the heroes of the faith in the old testament and the writers were like oh geez the ones that we all knew the ones we grew up singing songs about and whatnot exactly you come all the way up to hebrews 11 verse 32. and it says this after the writers wrote gone through and said all these people and then he says and what more can i say time is too short for me to tell you about gideon barack sampson and so on and so forth right so look who ends up in the hall of faith even though he was failed in his influence and he was influenced down the wrong way down the path of destruction it's samson he's there so what that tells us is your failure is never final it's never too late again thief on the cross but it is good to be recognizing the consequences of being negatively influenced and the bible tells us all about that you want to take the next couple verses honey yep tell us about it so this verse right here was my parents life i should have gotten this tattooed on my forehead with the amount of times that my parents said to me but first corinthians just like you want to get always tired down there first corinthians 15 33 it says do not be deceived bad company corrupts good morals yep or i've heard it differently bad company corrupts good character bad company corrupts good people like you're known by the company you keep right yeah show me your friends i'll show you your future that kind of thing yeah yep exactly yeah i think that's very true because a lot of the bible is just common sense or as some people call it in 2020 uncommon sense because not a lot of people have common sense but um we're not throwing stones that's just a logical observation anyways um yeah this is something that's that's huge right i think in proverbs 13 20 it says whoever walks with the wise becomes wise but the companion of fools will suffer harm and yeah that kind of makes sense if you have people around you who are wise who are speaking into your life in a way that's going to build you up and lead you the right way to warn you of certain things hey don't make these mistakes i i did that and i made this mistake there's another quote i heard another pastor of ours um give many many years ago he said a wise person learns from their mistakes but an even wiser person learns from the mistakes of others yes and jordan takes this quite literally um the bible study that we go to jordan i are probably the youngest people there by at least 40 years 40. okay maybe not 40. 20. it's a good mix there's some there's all these we are the youngest people there yeah except for ari when he comes that's true yeah i mean like we are probably the only ones in our twenties everyone is at least in their 45 and up yeah there's a lot of so we don't we hang out with older people um we did a bible study on james and james 5 says that if you ask for wisdom he will give it to you those who ask will freely receive it and that's very true yeah so that's something too and i think like a lot of times we just don't know like oh is this a good person to be with or um like even if it's a romantic relation especially if it's a romantic relationship right like i don't know if i should be with this person i don't know if they're a good influence um i don't it's like i don't know if you just ask god even if you're thinking that yeah but i think a lot of people tend to overthink or doubt for certain reasons that maybe isn't necessarily like a reason to break it off like i know we had our share of like concerns when we were i would say red flags is a way to term it that we both saw in each other as we were dating and those are things where you you mark it you red flag it you start praying about it and praying for the other person because we can't change each other only god can right lord put me on you because melania was praying for me so much but um yeah there's these tendencies that we have and it's we need wisdom from god to understand if this is something that is there can be grace and we can work towards strengthening this and improving this or i this is too toxic for me to even get involved with i need to break this off now right so obviously if it's done before marriage that's the best case scenario but there are certain times where you know abuse or sexual immorality or things like that within a marriage are our reasons and grounds to breaking it off so i don't want to get too much off on that but yeah god says he'll give wisdom to us when we ask him for it it's free and i need wisdom i was asking god for wisdom about something just like last night because again i mostly yeah i mostly don't know things in most cases i don't know like i'm not like hmm yeah this is the right thing uh lord can you help me with this one you know that's really cute it makes me happy to hear that i think it's cute i don't know if cute's the right word i think it's cute like i'm attracted to you when you say that oh okay any other wives relate to that like i like when you take lead of things and like seek biblical and godly advice and you're not just like doing whatever you want following your flesh to me that like is something that's attractive yeah maybe some people can relate maybe some people are like what is this girl on nonetheless i see what you're saying um but when we speak of influence so far we've talked about people right mainly talked about people but other things that can influence us as music movies um shows and this is something that the lord convicted me of just this year and i had a couple of friends a couple years back i think like three or four years ago um one of my really good friends her name is emily drew she recently moved away though and we've had kids so we've kind of like haven't been in touch as much as we once were but back in the day one of her convictions was music and she said that her and her husband would not listen to music that the world produced and at the time i was like that's so cute like i love that for you guys like that's really cute then i go to listen to like my music on the way back home like trap yeah it's like booty booty booty all this stuff it's gross so um now i really have that conviction too at the time i didn't but my mom and i did an igtv live on this and i'll link it down below but the lord really convicted me of that and since then i have really not listened to like worldly music i've created a playlist of music that i really like that's christian that isn't cringy and that was my thing like i love rap music i really do like i know i might not seem like the rap type person but i like a good beat i like gonna work out to praise and worship i am sorry i'm gonna fall asleep like i can't i need something that's like hype so my biggest struggle was like okay i'm not gonna listen to this cringy music that like doesn't sound good so um i did some digging i found really good christian playlist i created it and i've just been listening to it all the time i've posted it on my instagram so many of you have really enjoyed it but that was just a conviction of mine again i'm not putting my own convictions on your on you maybe that's not something the lord has convicted you of maybe that's not a weak point of yours for me i listen to music all day long all day long i am never in silence either with my kids by myself if i'm in the playroom i always have music playing so for me to swap that out was like a big deal because i was feeding myself nasty music like what our world listens to like   do you know what that stands for you do it's disgusting i'm sorry can we just take that is disgusting like why why is that okay why don't we talk about that like that song is gross well the thing is like i can't even listen to it for their secrets i'm like what how what the goal is keep moving right we see this in our world and the it's the the term is progressivism right like not to get political not to get you know opinionated but i'm just stating the fact of like we've progressed we're progressing in our world we shouldn't be surprised by this because that's what the bible talks about right like sin will be growing um especially more rapid in the end days right in the before the lord's return before the rapture next tuesday yeah pretty much but um we see this right and we look at look at like our people from the 40s 30s 40s 50s right like we we tend to go to like that's like the heyday here in america like the greatest generation type people like world war ii rosie the riveter like rolling up her sleeve like the woman going and doing it all like the family the the work like all that the men going off to war we see all this we're like wow this is like the ethos of the american family right and then now you go off to like   now you're like wow this is this we've come a long way since like yeah what was considered more modest right so this goal post keeps getting pushed further and further so i think we're going to reach an event horizon of complete debauchery and complete sodom and gomorrah i feel like we are already there but billy graham even said if god doesn't punish america he's going to have to apologize to sodom and gomorrah so that's the idea here is like melania's saying we are influenced by these things by music by the culture right and even kanye's talked about this and kanye yeah like say what you want about the guy he's he's very interesting but he's very wise he's got a lot of like unorthodox ideas that are seen as like not mainstream but the guy has a point when he talks about the culture and being controlled yeah joe rogan and just like his whole journey now in this new season of his life where yeah like yeah he's probably a baby christian still working out a lot of things and that's why paul says to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling meaning like look at it look at things and examine them and look at your life look at the scripture walk in these things and he says for it's a god who works in you yeah so we're not like getting hung up on this but i bring him up to say he recognizes like there's an influence there's a battle there's a light versus darkness there's a samson versus delilah spirit in the world yeah and it's all about who's influencing who right and music that was just like a big huge part yeah yeah so like i started off the story when my friend emily said that i actually when she said that i thought it was really sweet and cute and i was like huh i wonder if the lord will ever convict me of that or i wonder if i'll ever be if that will ever like bother me and then here i am where it's like a huge bother of mine so um that and tv so fun fact jordan and i do not watch tv um we don't have cable the cable that we have is like what comes with the tv so it's not even an hd it's like so blurry um i think there's another like alternative well yes that's how i was gonna say like we watch youtube i watch a lot of youtube i watch a lot of vlogs like real people um but i haven't watched the show in a really long time because every show i watched sex scene making out hardcore drawings it's just like okay why am i feeding myself this what good am i gonna get from this and let's not even get to like cuties or anything like that that's a whole nother whole another realm right now again goal posts getting moved right yeah yeah so that was just that's just one thing that we've dealt with i mean we stick to i at least stick to aspen's vlogs jesse gabriel kristen yeah just more wholesome content that's real and authentic and i don't know about you guys but just the more and more i live and experience things like people being influenced and things like that the more i see things like all this things that are once once considered like the benchmark of truth and the standard of truth whether that's the media and what all these cable news networks are saying or paid programming television right like you understand all these people have agendas right it's not like somebody's just getting on there and speaking of their mind of their own free will like there's these people are being influenced and they're influencing everyone else that's watching or listening like hollywood huge influence if you don't think that hollywood has an agenda with what they're putting out you're living under a rock i'm sorry you're just you're completely out of touch there's agendas with these things and we need to recognize it there's a fantastic study uh that was put out by answers in genesis i believe it's called demolishing strongholds i'll have to fact check myself on that mm-hmm but um i will put it together and whose name does he call jamie you want to pull that up you don't have a gene we need a jamie jamie can you fact check but um yeah it's a it's a youth kind of geared towards like middle school high school age program where it talks about these strongholds that were set up essentially like systems and um realms of influence whether that's like you said music media movies things like that where we don't even realize we're being influenced we're being fed a narrative of the world in things like as innocent and harmless as cartoons or children's movies or disney things right i'm not saying like these are all disney cartoons those the from way back then those were insane those there were a lot of them that were so racist that they've pulled or oh yeah um on disney plus now pay attention some of the old old old ones they will have written like this has um they've they tried to cover themselves up where they like run out of things saying like this culture culturally back then this was appropriate or culture something along the lines of like this is not okay never should have been okay but it's still out there and we're trying to backtrack on ourselves yeah and again like when i say when i talk about progressivism or progressing i'm talking more so in a down and a down client or decline of morality not fixing or correcting things that were wrong that should have never been accepted right so i want to make that very clear yeah that when melania are talking about progressing we're talking about progressing towards evil not progressing to fix and write things that were once considered okay that were never okay but yeah you're right whether it was extreme racism and depictions of people like african americans or native american whatever um this is something that like you grow up like oh i guess this is fine it's on a kid's show you know or like or more sexual innuendos or things like that these are all ways that we're being influenced and this whole answers in genesis uh study will talk about these things and like recognizing it calling it out um it's almost like a game that the host they have like different speakers come around but one of the guys like it's a game i play with my son is like we go to the movie and we try to spot interesting like one example he gives is in ice age it shows like the evolution of like man and ice goes from like the you know the little fish all the way to like the caveman it's like hmm interesting that they're all frozen in the same thing when they're supposed to be millions of years between each you know it's just like something similar like very subtle yeah but it's there right or they'll say something like oh that was hundreds of millions of years ago right all these different things so all these all these ideal ideologies you are being fed and told a narrative but people just discredit that or discount that because they think oh no this is just unbiased absolute truth because somebody's saying it right on someone's getting paid a lot of money to say it yeah so just be be aware of that and again hold us to that standard too guys because we're not above reproach we're not above any standard so we will do our best by god's grace to present to you our lives and the reality of who we are without trying to feed you some sort of narrative like from the very beginning our our verse our life motto for this podcast for everything is acts 17 11. go check us out go hold us accountable go back to the scripture this is the this is the authority this is the source because it comes from god so we're not trying to feed you a narrative we're just trying to tell you what god has told us in his word and quickly just bouncing back to what we first started talking about of like influencing and specifically how it's impacted our lives the main reason why we even started our podcast or started our channel was around astronomy in our house we were so we will serve the lord and it's really easy to like have the stereotype of what a christian person is and what that looks like and our minds always go to the extreme of like this person never parties this person just sits at home and reads their bible all day like like my whole goal has always been to like show like hey like christians are normal like you can have a really fun life you can like do these things like i've always wanted to show what what it looks like to be a christian it's not perfect at all y'all know that y'all know that you always call me out on that i know that but isn't that what our walk is isn't that what grace is that's a great point you bring up because that's really the nucleus of how your whole social media presence yeah and i don't mean to like keep talking about myself but i just thought that was fitting of what you said but you ought to talk about yourself because you're you right so who better to reference yourself than you or i can as you're oh yeah sometimes you know how jordan loves to say what molena means is that's how you know i said something i wasn't no no what i'm saying is um you're very humble you don't want to come off as like oh this is all about me but i'm saying it's did you steal my water yeah i've done it like five times oh i just noticed now and you are with the secret service i always make that joke i'm rusty um yeah every oh oh i can't stand that elena i'm like sleeping it's like two in the morning honey wake up aries crying i was like huh what you're so i was like i didn't hear she's like what you're not very attentive or alerted and you were in the secret service or something we'd like to do little jobs yeah i'm rusty now um i'm washed up i'm like thor when he gets like the big pot belly uh uh-huh and he's like uh you know he's like yeah um i'm like thor but just with the potbelly that's the only reference there no other reason shall we share who has influenced us yes but i was gonna say one more thing when you're talking about yourself like you are you know yourself better than anybody so people come to this podcast to listen to you i'm just kind of here to like you know word vomit yeah just kidding i'm just here i'm here to bring it down so that you bring it up and it appears like wow look how great this is but no i was gonna say is like that's the whole nucleus of your channel is um i am a normal person you're not someone who's living out in like the back woods in the middle of nowhere completely out of touch with reality but the video that really went viral was why we abstained from sex and people are looking at you like wow this is a beautiful attractive normal girl and she's talking about these things i thought i was the only one i thought that was only for like weird people who are completely jettisoned from society so you're saying you can be a normal person you can do these things as a christian right and not be perfect in them but you're still walking with grace walking with the lords you know leading you so good and then on that point tell us who has influenced you specifically i love youtube i love instagram and like as an influencer i am influenced a lot and consume a lot so sometimes it's really hard for me because i really have to like set that boundary of like okay you can't be on instagram all day every day so i am very particular about the people that i follow this was another conviction of mine i feel like i always go through type different purges of people and trying to find new people or just like if i've noticed that i have this certain thought when i see this person's post i'm going to unfollow because it is not bringing me joy it's not making me grow closer to the lord it's ruining my self-esteem or it's making me feel less than whatever the case may be there's no value in it right yes yeah yeah and my prayer is that i never be that to someone but i know that some people will perceive things differently and it's so funny because kristen johns posted this the other day she posted a story on her instagram of her flipping pancakes making pancakes in the morning and then she took a screenshot of her dms there were some people that were like oh my gosh this was so satisfying this made me so happy and brought me so much joy and other people are like oh my gosh this gave me severe anxiety you don't know how to flip pancakes and she was like this is insane but this is the internet so i know that some some things i might say some person might perceive it in the most beautiful way and another person might perceive it in the worst way possible so like my job is not here to please people i'm here to please the lord and fear the lord not people so if i'm your cup of tea then great thanks for being here if i'm not please don't feel like you have to be here like my last thing that i want to do is make you feel less than her there's not one sorry that was like a side tangent but no that's that makes perfect sense it fits right in and to that point there was there's not one word i would say about somebody that i would not also say right to their face and that i think that is the difference between um a troll sebastian maniscalco he's a comedian he's a little bit dirty sometimes he wasn't dirty he used to be clean yeah he's a little dirty but he's got he's got some language sometimes but his his jokes are usually very on point relatable he's talking about these people in the basement that just like our trolls on their comp yeah now they have an outlet to the rest of the world like we didn't know these people existed now yeah yeah well one of our reels just went like viral and the comments are insane i'm like wow like what people will just write i'm like how do you go to bed at night knowing you say these harmful things to people like i know you're far from you're like far removed from them and you don't think that they're people and they have so many comments so they don't see them but like the audacity yeah okay yeah it's just sad it causes us to pity and pray right yeah yeah anytime i get a hate comment i just pray for people i really do and it took me a while to arrive here because trust me i did not pray for people when they would hate me i felt quite the opposite but now i'm at a point where i really do pity people and i feel really bad because i can't imagine how miserable their life me might be or how sad or how deep of a place they might be to potentially say this to a person they have never ever met so i've really come around to that but anyway let's talk about who has influenced me i have a list of people i've made it into different categories because i feel like i follow specific people for different reasons so i did a wife category a mama category and then like a spiritual and like religious category so as mothers or no let's start with wives wives audrey roloff has had a huge impact on how i see wives or how like i see marriage because of how intentional her and jeremy are they also have a podcast they have a book they have so many things and so many resources out there but i just love how intentional they are about literally everything like if they're doing something there is a long list of reasons why they're doing it and how they're doing it how it's backed up by scripture like i just really love their marriage and how real they are about their marriage too because they'll show the ups but they also show the downs so love her also sarah thesis and this is not her last name this is her middle name but she's on youtube is that how you pronounce her name do you know what i'm talking about i think it's teresa's maurice or t theresa yes i love her she's so candid thesis like a thesis statement of i thought that's exactly what it was i have such a hard time with names i don't know i'm gonna add that i gotta add that to them to my isms go ahead but she is just like such a god-fearing woman and i have so much respect for her she's in both my category for wife and mom just because of the way that she like looks up to her husband and lifts him up and prays for him and just like serves and wants him to lead like just the way that she is as a wife is just very abnormal admirable admirable what's the word honey i am i can't get it out admirable admirable i can't my tongue doesn't work that way admirable add abnormal is that what you're trying to say it again go slower admirable admireable there we go admirable add just say it like more abnormal add add a bowl mole was my first language some english words i just cannot say yeah that's why i rip on melania's because like i think two languages knows two languages okay all right next thing moms first one that came to mind is uh kaylee mundane she is so cute i'll link all of these women down below but she is a mother of four or five i think it's four but they're all under the age of like eight they're all really young she had them really close together she has irish twins so i relate to her in the sense of like lazy and ari being really close in age irish twins her two babies are 12 months apart so she literally like had a baby and then had a baby and got pregnant like she had them really close together but she's just such a cute mom i learned affirmations from her she does affirmations with her kids and like it's just really sweet she really loves and lifts up her children so i've really just loved and watched her from behind the scenes another one is raising five kind she's so cute she has five kids she's a little bit older but i just really admire her and i admire the way that she's with her kids i love everything that she recommends she's just very sweet she's five adorable kids they're like the cutest thing ever um and then last one is um one of the robertsons so i love the robertson family i grew up basically watching them because their show came out when we were in like what middle school or something probably yeah it was a while ago and we always used to watch them but i really love the mom i think she's really sweet she loves her kids to death like the post that she'll write about them and now she has grandkids i don't know i just like really admire her love for her family and her wanting to be intentional with the family cute cute how are we doing i like it i'm learning some of these too because there's people here that i haven't heard that you have been influenced by so that's interesting yeah news to me tea but it makes sense okay spiritually sadie robertson i said i love them sadie is so cute she's like the same age as us like i feel like i relate to that she's married now she's pregnant which is like so cute um so yeah i really like everything that sadie posts i feel like i i've been following her for a very long time so i feel like she's always just been someone that i really look up to but you said spiritually wouldn't what in a spiritual matter i'd say like spiritually and like in a more like religious way like the stuff that she posts just always be i don't know i like following people who will post scripture or will like encourage me or will make me feel repentant in some way you know like i really like her talks i like her podcast that type of i see yeah okay next up is my sister and i feel like this is like so cringy to say but she really has really influenced me melanie right now is on fire for the lord and it's very encouraging to see like she when she comes here and she doesn't see my bible like me reading my bible she calls me out she's like did you read your bible today i've been here for three days and you haven't read your bible once are you reading your bible and like it's it's low-key annoying but like very true like she'll call you out girlfriend calls you out and i appreciate that i feel like that's the type of person i need in my life jordan doesn't call me out enough i don't think jordan's a little more on the soft side but melanie hammering down so i was like that too when i was younger in my walk with the lord yeah which is i think is admirable like i was saying she's on fire for the lord right now that flame is hot so i admire that she's always praying throughout the day like just a lot of what she does during the day is i'm not going to say that word again i'm not a little but i appreciate her love for the lord and then now last one is ally yard yard yes yeah i talked about her earlier today she was one that posted about influencers and being christian and not having to preach her page is amazing she spits truth bombs all day and this is what i love to see on my feet in the middle of the day because like i was saying i feel like i'm constantly feeding into this stuff so seeing a post like that or a post that's super just like explaining scripture or just calling things out it's just very admirable and i really like that page so those are the ones i have to share obviously there are so many more so many more that i could talk about but these are the ones that just like really came to mind of each topic um i was actually going to do an igtv this has been on my list to do things for a very long time and that was to speak of people that influenced me so i did kind of save a few that i'm not mentioning here for that igtv um because i wanted to talk more about them and give them shout outs and stuff so what i think is interesting though is in your list there's pretty much only women well no not that with the exception of melanie they're all social media persons right personalities personnel influencers and that's something to i think people don't realize is you as a quote unquote influencer i'm influenced a lot are influenced by other influencers so it's like this big weaved web of influences and that is something you've talked about before you've on and on um recurring occurred what am i trying to say it's been a recurring theme in a lot of things that you talk about is social media consumption yeah and if i put in the analogy of food is something that we all consume right yeah you consume food and your body reacts and your mind reacts you know it has a it has an effect on everything from your energy to your um level of fitness to your your mental you know health and wellness and all that just from what you're eating right what you're putting into your body physically you're also consuming in the same way social media right so if you're consuming again back to the food analogy a bunch of junk food a bunch of stuff that's processed and overly processed and artificial that's going to have an effect on your your health right your your physical health and similarly if you're eating good stuff in the right foods yeah you're going to have a better output or a better product from that so like you're saying with social media it's the same here is if you're being influenced and consuming all the wrong things all the junk food social media related that's what that's going to have the impression on your spirit on your heart on your on your mind right mm-hmm but if you're like all these people that you mentioned they're they're the organic section they're they're the i've never grocery shopped that whole foods fun fact i've gone i've gotten like little small novel things and stuff i just can't justify the prices but yeah anyways does that make sense yes yeah i was just gonna say like i had to unfollow bar stool oh yeah i think i did this a while ago but i had been following them since i was in high school and like first made my whenever instagram first came out they were like one of the first meme accounts like funny accounts to follow and i've been following them for years and i was like i can't unfollow them but the junk that they were posting i was like i don't need to see this every day i don't need this yeah no thank you so much i have a short list of i was gonna say i don't know if anyone's going to want to hear it but i'll share it nonetheless um i would say similar to melania i have different people have influenced me in different realms of my life um first off my parents i think it's kind of a given honestly i was gonna put them in there but i was trying to like do people that people could like look up and would know who they are yeah i understand and i say my parents i don't say that lightly or like oh that's cliche that's a given because it's really not and it wasn't until i got older and started experiencing more people who come from different backgrounds and upbringings than i see real quick yeah go ahead you can keep talking i'll be okay i'll just talk to your microphone i talked to the camera when you went to the right because it felt weird like talking to myself you know should i turn like the opposite way so the camera shoots the back okay um but yeah that's i i don't take that for granted because i was blessed to have both my parents in the house raising me and that is a gift and a privilege and i'm so thankful for that and a lot of their guidance and their leading their discipline their instruction has caused me to be the man that i am today so i'm very grateful i don't say that lightly or or just in a cliche matter like oh yeah it's your parents or can i get like no it's they they were not perfect they're not perfect but they did such a heck of a job i mean look how look at me i turned out okay right and uh yeah it's just uh something i'm very thankful for and so they've also patterned for me um a way to parent my children and also maybe some things that if you know maybe i disagreed with or like again i said they're not perfect but they did a really good job and i want to take the things that they did right and implement those and things that maybe i'm like yeah you know maybe that's something that was just a character flaw or something that they were taught from their parents that will probably you know disregard uh same thing marriage wise like relationally right so they've influenced me in that way of things to do maybe some things not to do right and that's just kind of uh how it goes how life goes so other than my parents um for a relationship i would say my brother um very soft-spoken kind of the opposite personality of me he's more introverted but he has come out of his shell a lot more i'd say in probably the last 10 years he was a leader at intervarsity which is like a christian fellowship in college and that really i think caused him to take on more of like a leadership role because he's been very like follower and even though jordan is the youngest you would think that jordan was the oldest in the way that you would plan play dates and all of that hi can ben come over and play i'm 18 years old i want to have a play date no but yeah yeah melania's milan is right i was more on the initiative yeah um and so yeah but i'd say with my brother like the way he treats his wife my sister-in-law and he's very intentional with certain things so that causes me to say wow i need to be more like that or i i want to be more like that right yeah so he's definitely somebody too in relationships that i think has modeled a good healthy response in a lot of ways um as far as spiritual influences i've brought them up a lot but let me guess robbie is on the list yes so for apologetics which is the study the discipline of giving logical answers for why we believe what we believe as christians i think ravi is among is at the top of the list of giving grace and truth and clarity to the bible in a way that's very loving and gentle like first peter 3 15 says always be prepared to give an answer a reason for your faith but do this with gentleness and respect i struggle with that part as do i but ravi's been a great um influence and a great model of that so that's my example in apologetics as far as just like biblical teaching and biblical understanding definitely chuck missler uh he's one of the best he's also passed away a few years ago but uh man the guy just had such a passion and a love for the scripture very knowledgeable he has i think every single book of the bible on audio or video where he will take you verse by verse through everything and he's not trying to sell you on an agenda sell you on one particular perspective what i really appreciate about about chuck and he's actually who inspired us with the whole act 17 11 be a berean kind of motto that we have he was the one that did that and he will say hey look here's a controversial passage in scripture and some people think this some people think that yeah i'm going to present to you what i think and sometimes it's he's siding with these people sometimes he sides with this group or sometimes he presents a whole different perspective but he always says but my goal isn't to convince you of what i believe you go do your own homework and take it up with the lord and he will reveal it to you so that's the kind of person you can trust again that's why we're talking back to what we're talking about earlier of like everyone's got an agenda i really don't think there's an agenda with chuck yeah other than he wants you to love god and know him better through his word and so he he takes such measure to explain and and coin in in house which is his ministry um they're they're friends of ours now we've developed a friendship with them and uh they all have the same heart mission as just to help people fall in love with the bible and to understand that so yeah they've done a great job and then the all the way up until now and and uh they do they do a great job so definitely chuck missler all things like bible study and understanding the bible i would say from like like a christian living or like a place of like what does it look like to walk daily with the lord or to know how to implement scripture in my life our mentor i was gonna derry i'm curious to see yeah i mean i've known darren now for you have an influencer in mind too though um yeah actually tim tebow yes i love tim tebow yeah he's he's solid um just let me let me i'll come back to tim but yeah just for dairy for a second so i can honor him darry is probably the most rough around the edges kind of guy but i've known him for about 15 years or 10 years now and i can say with all assurance that he has never done anything for the wrong reason when it comes to spiritual or biblical matters everything he does is the intention of protecting people from lies and disinformation especially when it comes to what it means to be a christian what it means to follow the bible yeah and so i'm indebted to him for helping me to see like this is the world through the biblical lens right and again he's not perfect he doesn't have it all right there's some things we disagree on but there's still grace for one another and i know molina agrees with that too so all in all like as hard as it is to live the christian life i think darry has done a fantastic job of walking the walk and talking to talk too and tim tebow like somebody on social media again millions of followers double athlete like professional sports and baseball and football and all that stuff absolutely through the ringer through the media and through like the secular world where you know they got to find every little thing to rip him apart even though the dude on paper like his flawless i mean obviously i don't say that in like a he's without sin but i'm just saying like the guy has no tea on him right the guy has no dirt and isn't it sad how is the christian you're trying to like throw dirt on it isn't that so i find that very annoying yeah it's like it's already hard enough being an influencer slap the word christian influencer on top of it and they want to find everything wrong with you yeah there's a tim tebow book right there by the way um you know he's one of like the only guys i follow on instagram i probably follow i think three guys on instagram yeah him and his wife and his wife are so cute yeah she's gorgeous she was like she's so pretty she was miss you universe i think yeah they just posted a picture yesterday and i was just staring at her face i'm not kidding i was like you know like the uh the emojis it's like an eye then the lips and then the eye that's melange's oh you know what i'm talking about yeah but yeah um yeah they're a beautiful couple and uh obviously their hearts even more so yeah but yeah i would say tim's a great guy he really models like what it means to love the lord love your wife and love people um so yeah we we love love timmy and yeah that's that's kind of my list um cute honey but it's a good episode we hope this encourages you guys to just kind of take an uh introspective look at who's influencing you how you're influencing others yeah and ultimately what the word of god says about that so we did it awesome great job honey me too let me share just in closing scripture of the day and then our prayer request and we will close out so the scripture comes from matthew 6. why did i just close my eyes you can close your eyes for the word this is matthew 6 this is in the middle of jesus's sermon on the mount and he's talking about um how to pray right and wait this has to do with being deceived too because the enemy at the servant of servant no sermon on the mount um the enemy kept saying oh well doesn't scripture say this and it was a twisted version of scripture and jesus goes no no this is what oh you're thinking of jesus being tempted in the wilderness that's literally the chapter before the sermon on the mountain oh okay yeah and the sequence that follows yeah that just kind of goes with um what you're talking about i wasn't trying to like like nitpick i know i know correct not lead people straight again i do that all the time but we know what you mean and we love you anyways thanks thank you but that was something we were talking about earlier about the enemy being very deceitful and looking good looking pretty tasty yummy but ain't the truth absolutely so yes jesus in the sermon on the mount comes to this idea of praying right and he says this in chapter six verse five whenever you pray you must not be like the hypocrites because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people truly i tell you they have the reward but when you pray go into your private room shut your door and pray to your father who is in secret and your father who sees in secret will reward you when you pray don't babble like the gentiles since they imagine they'll be heard for their many words don't be like them because your father knows the things you need before you ask him i thought how assuring is that last part he already knows what we need and again back to the james 1 5 if we lack wisdom let us ask god who gives freely without finding any wrongdoing and he'll give it to us right so he already knows what we need all we have to do is ask him and he will give it to us the things that we need but i love how it talks about not being doing things out in display right and as we're talking about influencers and how we're influencing people like make sure we're doing things for the right reasons right not to just be seen or to have a reward from the praise of man like you're saying i'm not fearing people i'm fearing god we don't we don't want people to control us or give give them more influence than they should have in our lives yes so do things with humility and secret as the bible says because the lord sees it all and he will reward us for that so that's my encouragement that's the scripture for this day and our prayer request as we close out is for monica's cousin who just had a baby boy and he was just born a couple weeks ago but he's already had several surgeries um she didn't really go into the details of it but um i just really can't imagine any time we see things like this about little babies going under yeah thanks all these procedures it just it strikes a different chord so it does honey can i impose on you to pray for monica's cousin's baby yeah and we'll close out okay thank you god for another beautiful day today thank you for this podcast and the platform that you've so trusted us with i pray that we will always keep you first that you would give us the wisdom um i'd like to pray for monica's cousin and her baby i can't imagine what this child has gone through i pray that your angels will protect him if he has any more surgeries and keep him healthy and guide him through his life in jesus name we pray amen amen thank you we love you guys a couple quick final notes we are doing our facebook page um monday wednesday and friday giving you guys a little encouragement uh just to

motherhood hey guys welcome back to my channel today i am going to bring you along with my mommy pampering evening nighttime routine it's not my my nighttime routine i wish i did this every night but this is kind of what i do when i need a moment to myself when i just like i need a breather when i feel like i'm getting overwhelmed too stressed out since having my second baby this has been something i've tried really hard to be routine about because i have struggled with postpartum depression and this is actually my first time even talking about it on my channel um once i feel comfortable talking about it i will but until then i really had to take a couple of steps and kind of figure out like okay what are we gonna do for you quickly realize that if you don't make time for yourself if you don't make your mental health or your needs a priority literally no one else will so i hope this video encourages you to any moms out there that feel like they don't have a break that they don't have a second i just want to push you and encourage you to take care of yourself because if you can't fill up your cup if you can't like function as a human being then it's gonna be really hard to take care of your kids you're gonna feel very overwhelmed very stressed out and we're already in the middle of a pandemic like we already have all the stress that we need from the outside elements that we don't need anything else so hope this video was encouraging to you um i like hesitated hey hey hey don't pull him by the tail i actually hesitated doing this video because people love to hate on moms especially when they take care of themselves as weird as that is i feel like any time a mom is like hanging on by a thread has no help and all of this is like doing all this by themselves everyone's like oh my gosh yeah you are such a good mom like congrats but when a mom asks for help or if a mom takes care of herself if a mom god forbids takes a shower or washes her hair people are like oh my gosh you're so selfish like why aren't you taking care of your kids oh my gosh you need help to watch your kids while you work people like love to hate you for that and it doesn't make any sense to me so that's why i was ahead of the night because people just love to hate so if you have that type of comment you can leave now thank you so much first thing is i have someone with the kids because obviously i'm not going to bring them with me so i feel like this routine would kind of depend on the type of person you are so believe it or not i am kind of an introvert not kind of i really am an introvert i get my energy when i'm by myself and that yes yes it was back in school it's cool mama what's that package pekka school what is that i'm a huge introvert and once i had kids like you can't be an introvert because you poop with the toddler in your hand and you pee with a baby in your hand you shower with a kid in your arms like everything that you do you have someone with you so i get my energy when i'm by myself so most of these activities will revolve around me being alone and doing alone things even my husband love him to death but i'm like dude go away please like i need to be alone so a lot of these activities again like i said will require me to be alone i know some people like my husband he loves to be around people so for him his thing is like working out with a friend or going to a friend's house or like socializing with people i wish i was like that but i'm not today's stuff will include more things that like i normally don't do just for the sake of the video see what i'm saying i can't even i can't even say a sentence love my kids but i just sometimes i want to be a human and not just a mom and i feel like that's really important sometimes becoming and being a mom becomes someone's true identity and you are so much more than a mom you're still a human being yourself and you need to take care of that human so for me it's getting my nails done so i always was against getting manicures and stuff i was always a petty girl but recently i really have enjoyed having long nails and so i've been doing shellac so that's gonna be the first thing we're gonna do um my nails right now are currently way too long so these are my real nails but i let them get too long one broke this one broke over here too so i'm going to shorten them down a little bit redo them i'm probably going to do a color or maybe not i don't know i really like this pattern so this is something that i do once a month i can get these to last a full month but again because this broke it's because it's too long so i'm going to shorten them down um it'll last that long so that's my one thing i'm going to do you got let me see you got some oranges okay you want me oh did you try biting it we gotta cut it okay i'm gonna cut this up for her and then jordan is gonna watch her so i will be right back and i'll see you at the nail salon all right guys it's been a couple of hours um alithea is down for her nap we had our dinner already um ari is still awake but jordan is with him so i'm gonna get started on my next step and that is to wash my hair and it's pretty sad that i see washing my hair as a luxurious pampering moment but i only wash my hair once a week and when i do it i make it whole thing doing more stuff like face mask bath hair washing all that is like what i love so i did pour it well actually jordan poured me a glass of some sparkling rose i think is what this is i wash my hair once a week and i make it into this big deal and i put oplex in my hair and none of the stuff i'm going to talk about is sponsored these are products that i just generally use and i'm obsessed with not that if it was sponsored it wouldn't be stuff that i'm obsessed with but i'm just saying i'm gonna walk you through this so i like to do oplex and the reason i like it is because i put so much blonde in my hair recently and i feel like every nail person or not nail hair person oh wait i didn't even show you my nails so i did almond and these are my real nail with shellac just these two are fake that she put that are acrylic but they're not acrylic but she put she put tips on these too um i just made them a lot shorter and then this color i think is called nude bar which i think looks pretty cute and like looks good with my skin i always do something neutral because i just like like a neutral thing there i turned that light off because i felt like it was like too bright it's really dark and really late right now it's 10 o'clock so wanted to make sure we can get the feel of 10 o'clock so it's the other day can you tell i promise i'm not drunk or anything i literally took three sips um it's just the end of the day and the end of the week so i like using all plex i feel like every hair person salon always raves about it is like you know what let's try this oplex so it's basically like a hair mask and because i do it i only wash my hair once a week i figured it's just better to do it just that one time that i wash it and i'm not like using so much of it because it is kind of expensive so i like that i don't use it that frequently one bottle like the small bottle will last me anywhere between like two to three months so i think that's pretty good and i feel like my hair has been so healthy because of it okay my hair is all brushed out normally i would take my shirt off at this point but obviously i'm not going to but i'm going to get my hair wet which is like the water okay now that i'm in here i washed my face before it came in i'm gonna do a face mask now i have tried so many face masks this one right here from fresh is my favorite one this is what it looks like it's a it's called the lotus youth preserve rescue mask so i love how like fresh and clean it feels i'm just going to put that all over my face and leave that on while i take my bath now i wish i was the type of person that would like read a book or like do something like that in the bath but honestly i just like to sit here sometimes i'll go on my phone or watch like a youtube video or something but i really just like take this time to like actually relax and unwind so i'm gonna keep this on it feels nice and lemon here it's a little too hot actually but it's fine i'm not pregnant so i don't worry about that that's like the most annoying thing about being pregnant is taking lukewarm baths i i am not about those so i'm gonna just sit here cheers to motherhood all fresh and clean i had every intention of actually self tanning right now but i'm very lazy right now and i have so many different self tanners but the quickest and easiest one for me that i have just fallen in love with is the one from isle of paradise it's like a spray water and it's so easy to do very like mess free doesn't stain your bed sheets none of that and alathia grabbed it and i have no idea where she put it i cannot find it i've been searching for it for three weeks now and they had a sale for black friday so i ordered one and it was supposed to be here today but it's not so i don't want to use any other one because i just don't want to have to deal with my sheets being brown for another week um because i wash my sheets once a week so i don't want to deal with that i'm not going to self tan then i'm just going to lather myself up in oil i love just excuse me i love jehovah oil so i'll put on like an oil and then i'll put cream over on top of it i'm going to goop up my face as well and then i'm going to go downstairs and spend time with the hubby we are going to make a bazooka so normally this is like okay so so far with the routine normally i wouldn't have done my nails but today was an exception and i don't think i said this yet but i either do this on friday saturday or sunday normally not in the middle of the week because i like to stay up because it's the only time i have it's like once the kids go to bed so normally it's like oplex with the hair i'll take a bath i'll get out of my bath i'll do a tanning i normally like to tan but i'm just waiting for the isle of paradise to come in and then um i'll do like face mask and then i'll spend time with jordan and we'll like either make something or we'll do kind of like an at-home date night um so so today we want to make pazukas because i'm craving a bazooka pazuki pazuki sorry wait jordan's doing the dishes all right he just came back he got the stuff so normally when you make these okay if you're not familiar there's this restaurant called bj's is that where it originates from or is that like or pazuki's like before bj's i think i think they like established it yeah i could be wrong but i feel like they either created it or like perfected it yeah they're famous for that is what i know so it's basically a giant cookie in a pan normally a cast iron do they give it to your cast iron there yeah right yeah they're like some type of paper yeah so basically you make like an enjoy a whole pan of cookie so that's what we're gonna do today you can be not lazy and like actually make cookie dough from scratch but i just got this thing jordan just got this thing it's not so much about laziness it's about patience melania's not very patient when it comes to her cookies yeah she wants to see you that's very true what you needed she's looking at me like you need to tell them what you told me earlier you're gonna draw me a bath you're gonna get me a glass of wine and then what what was the last you make the joke too much it's not funny anymore but there was some innuendo i will say so jordan goes i'll draw your bath because he knows it's my pamper day well no no you gotta you gotta tell them never mind what you gonna explain you have to say i'm not gonna say it has to come from your mouth sir i mean i don't mind saying it you know i don't care about that stuff but i don't want to steal your joke well it all started when you went back to the holistic doctor you've made this joke so many times i know it's one thing it's not funny i'm gonna butter it up with this irish butter this is the best butter ever to bake with cherry gold huh kerrygold yeah jordan is cleaning the countertops now he's really i really want you to have what vitamin d   well it started it was like a half joke because molina went to the holistic doctor and she's like okay you're deficient and what was it uh iodine iron vitamin c and vitamin d and so the next morning i put out all of melania's supplements and vitamins to take and i put the iodine the iron and the vitamin c and then she's that she's like oh where's the vitamin c that'll be later or something like something stupid like that oh now that oh my little dad jokes that's not dad sharks it's like middle school boy   now that my third grade brain is in the gutter let's finish make some cookies and then have some vitamin d honey you're going careful get to monetize i'm not um right will this melt or should i squish it   oh yeah know you need to like form it press it down okay it's just my hands yeah kind of match it down your thumbs why haven't you made this before babe you're the devil making me go get this guy you can say no can i though can i say no to this i don't feel like i can say no to this i feel like it's more of a sin to say no to making a pazuki and eating it than it is to not make it and eat it okay it's the weekend these smell so good yeah it's a friday i don't even know if i said that yet but look let me get in here hang on wait let me pull her out oh that looks so good okay wait this is so heavy how am i gonna get this out good honey yeah this is my workout for today that is a literal perfection top it off with a little ice cream and it's the good thing about the ice cream so like normally i hate melty ice cream but when you put it on here while it's still warm like i wouldn't do it right the second i do it maybe like five minutes let it kind of cool down you think i'm gonna wait five minutes well i was saying let the ice cream kind of melt and it like soaks in and makes it super i hate the word moist but you know yes the cookie right yeah it makes it like soggy that's soggy is no better than moist but like a good soggy yeah it actually tastes good i like it i don't want to put this on yet go ahead five minutes five seconds same   difference do hey guys welcome back to my channel i'm doing a sit-down video i haven't done one of these in a minute i'm so excited i feel like sit down videos tend to be my favorite ones because you know i feel like they're homey and cozy so grab a coffee grab the water i have my iced coffee over here and let's chat so this is kind of like a continuation of my gentle parenting series toddler series that i have done so a lot of what i'm going to talk about today will be a more practical side of videos that i have done in the past so i did a video talking about discipline and how i discipline my toddler and i literally walk you guys through all of the like what goes through my mind um i bring a lot of research and science and stuff that people have found and data that has been studied on toddlers and how they think and all this stuff so if you if that's like what you're really looking for you'll definitely find it in that other video this video will definitely be a lot more practical like showing you guys like actually what i do what actually happens throughout our day so honestly i don't even know what i'm going to title this video yet toddlers get bored really easily and they love to play they love to interact they love to do what you're doing so i've just kind of done a couple of things that i feel like has helped alexia be a really happy baby um i'm not gonna say like good or bad baby because there's no such thing as good or bad kids kids are not bad their behavior might be not exactly what we want but that is not a reflection of them as children so i will be intentionally not saying like good or bad kid i really want to say like a joyful child or a child that's excited to explore all of that she begins if you have not already subscribed go ahead and do so down below before we get started my daughter is going to be two in two months so um she yeah she if you follow my vlogs or anything like that you know how she is she's very sassy very spunky she's just like such a cute little thing but she is a lot of work just like every other child so once she wakes up i can't stop i can't it's hard to like get stuff done so i tried to get my devotional out of the way i tried to do my workout before she wakes up i try to unload the dishwasher really quickly before she wakes up throw in a load of laundry i try to do these like little annoying tasks that require some time before she wakes up no i wish i woke up at five i know so many moms that do props to them i'm definitely not one of those i'm more of a 6 30 7 o'clock ish mom um but also my kids do normally sleep in until about eight so that is a huge advantage that i have they're not like waking up at five because if they did i don't know what i would do so i do have that advantage to me um but i try to get those things done and out of the way other tasks that i need to do throughout the day such as cooking and cleaning taking care of the dogs just like those random like household things i love to include her and she loves to be a part of that too so i'm going to share with you guys a couple of things that i do with these tasks that involve olathe that involve the toddler toddlers learn through play that is something that i talk about all the time but for them they play all day and that's when they learn i know a lot of people think like oh learning is confined to a classroom or learning is confined to a book nook or like a corner where you only do this like no learning happens all day long with kids so they're always observing and seeing what we're doing and they love to help they really do alethia's favorite thing to do is like crack eggs and mix the pot and poor things like she thrives doing that stuff so i try to take advantage of that and really help her grow and experiment and that so first thing if you've been here before you know i rave about the learning tower this is a tower that allows the child to be the same height as a countertop and they can easily just climb up in there and they're able to help you with stuff so i will normally pull it up to my stovetop now i didn't do this at first when she was like just now learning how to use it but now she knows the stove is hot she knows not to touch so i will bring her close enough where she can see but not too close where she can like just stick her hand if she wants to so definitely find that medium and see where you're comfortable with your child a lot of these things i've been doing with lacia for since she was about a year old so it's been about a year of this so she's very familiar with things and it's not like it's brand new so if your child is around the same age and it's the first time exposing them definitely be cautious and like let them know hot cold all that stuff so definitely just use your motherly instinct because god gave them to you for a reason so she loves to crack eggs with me she loves to mix things so the learning tower has been a great tool for that she also loves to eat there and that brings me to my next point um i let all of her snacks be at her height i let all of her bowls and plates and cups anything that's hers is essentially at her height and so if she wants a snack she can grab it and she grabs it she'll grab a bowl and she'll put it all on her tower she'll climb up the tower and put it on the countertop and she'll eat while i'm cooking breakfast um if she doesn't want to help me that's normally what she'll do i'll go for like an appetizer i'll let her choose i always let her make a choice i'll give her two options she can pick between each one it gives her autonomy it gives her independence and like lets her pick what she wants um so i'll give her like a little snack while i'm making the food and she can eat that or she can come and cook with me as well while we're kind of like in this cooking category i also got her a like kid friendly knife so it's actually called a wedger and it's not sharp i mean it's slightly sharp like sharp enough where it can cut something but not like a finger and she loves this i'll give it to her in the mornings if she doesn't want to help me cooking i'll give her banana and she'll just quickly cut up the banana she'll play with it she'll also eat it hairs i give it to her with like foods that are a little bit more on the softer side because i found if she has to really press really hard that ends up being more dangerous because if it slips it the pressure could like hurt her more um so i just love that i love that because it helps her with her fine motor it helps her feel involved and gives her confidence to use like a knife as well also in the food category um when i'm making dinner i always do this and i will give her a pouring activity to do so she really enjoys pouring i've noticed that's just something she really likes she loves water so i'll actually put down like a cookie sheet or like a baking sheet and then i'll put two cups that are like for pouring so that way when it spills it spills within the pan and i don't have to do like a big cleanup and big whatever um and normally it's at the end of the day when she does this so like if she gets wet it's fine i do have bibs though um and like full on smacks that she can wear but towards the end of the day i'm like you're already covered in food anyway it's fine it's not that big of a deal um but that doesn't bother me and clean up is really easy you can just throw it in the dryer so she loves doing that activity while i'm cooking as well last task that i feel like involves her is the dogs so she loves to feed the dogs and she loves to put them outside so where we feed the dogs we use scoopers and we have a scoop for her that she can use to feed the dogs it doesn't fit that many in there so it's not like we're giving our dogs a whole nother cup of food it's just like a couple of pebbles that she puts in there but she really enjoys that and then she also loves to walk our dogs so this one i mean you feel free to know like if your dog sees another dog and they're gonna dash and run for it probably don't have your toddler walk with your dog but if your dog tends to be better with walks then you can definitely have them walk them or sometimes i'll give her like the poop bag without the poop in it already like the bags that just like are for poops um she'll carry that she'll walk with that um she'll like help hold the dogs sometimes they can't she can walk the dogs but like i have it depends um i've also brought a like fake leash before so she can hold it and think that she's walking the dogs but really it's like me that's holding it but it's attached to the dog still so if they're really persistent about doing that that's a really good hack as well um but those are just some tasks that i do to involve her throughout like the monday things and during that time she's having so much fun i'm spending time with her we're bonding together she's learning it's just overall fabulous okay now let's move on to the stuff that you're like okay i can't do this with a toddler so let's say you work from home or you have a meeting or phone call or something important that you have to do during the day so these are normally things that i'll have i'll do with her um when i don't have help so first thing is quiet time and quiet time is something that i've worked with her for a very long time now i think since she was about the age of like eight months i started working on quiet time and it took us a while to get here we're finally here but it basically is a time where she is quiet and playing by herself and it's just like independent play basically so there's different ways you can do this if you want you can set up a blanket and call it the quiet blanket put the child in the blanket and give them like four or five different toys let them pick up the toys they want to bring to the blanket and you can slowly introduce them to this so you can let them know like you're going to sit here for one minute and that one minute i need you to play with these toys when the one minute is up i'll come back and i'll come get you and we can play together um also a great thing to include in this is the timer trick i talked about that in my previous videos but this is definitely when you want to incorporate that so i would start off with a minute and do that for a couple of days then um bump it up to two minutes three minutes four minutes and then whatever number design you can get to there have been times and this has been recent where she'll play by herself for 30 minutes and i never thought we'd get here but guys it is wonderful and she loves it so much there are some times where i am done working and i am done with my stuff and i can't wait to play with her and i'm so excited to be with her and stay with her and i'll go and play with her and she goes no my mind go my mind go and she'll literally tell me to go because she wants to play by herself which i mean like i have a love-hate relationship with that which is like it's good that she's independent but it makes me sad because i want to play with her but it's not always that she's like that it just depends on her mood so very happy at that point so quiet time is super important i'll give her books whatever you don't have to confine them to a blanket we have our playroom upstairs and what i'll do is i'll close all the doors to the bedrooms and the only place you'll have access to is her playroom the entire plane room is safe everything is mounted to the wall there are no like nothing could fall or happen that she would injure herself all the toys are safe so i won't be down here worried like oh she's gonna find a knife upstairs like i know there's nothing up there so um quiet time is a great thing as well next thing it would be sensory play so sensory plate can be a little bit messy but it can also be really wonderful if it's an activity that's not too messy so for example i think water is one that isn't too messy and i know you might be like huh but if you just take off their clothes and put on a smock like all that's gonna get wet is like the surrounding areas like i don't feel like that's a big deal painting on the other hand like that's not something i would give to them while i'm doing something else um alecia is also used to doing sensory play so you would think like oh my gosh she's always messy and doing sensory play well actually i feel like it's been the opposite because she does it so much she's so used to it that like it doesn't get super messy when she's doing it because she's so used to it it's not like this new big thing like she knows what to do she knows how to like keep it clean so find the activity that your child really likes that's quote unquote mess free um such as coloring they have these really cool pens i can't remember what they're called magic markers or something where it's like a specific pen and a specific paper when you draw it it only shows up on that paper so you can give your child an activity like that you can give them the pouring activity you could do lentil beans or beans rice any type of those with boring activities rainbow rice anything like that that tends to be more mess-free in my mind mess i think more of like liquids that can really go everywhere like paint and like if she runs off and like gets paint on my walls that is i'm not two about that so and then last thing is tv we love a good tv show don't we um alathia has really gotten into movies lately she loves moana wreck-it ralph tangled um what else does she like i think those are like her first three she was on moana for a good like three months and wouldn't watch anything else and then we started with wreck-it ralph and tangled and she's really enjoyed those so i personally resort tv time and make it something really special i found that the more they watch it the more they get used to it and the less magical it feels and the less like fun it feels so i really tried to limit the tv for these moments that at the end of the day i'm so tired and i really need to get a couple things done or i really want to cook dinner in peace or i can tell she's just kind of tired and wants to do something different i will let her watch tv and since having ari i've let her watch tv obviously a lot more because my hands are so full um so i will let her watch at least 30 minutes of tv and again i'll put the timer with all of these i tend to put a timer even if i am going to do something with work i'll let her know like mommy has to do work for 30 minutes i'm going to set a timer and when those 30 minutes are up i'll come back you know it's not every day where i'm leaving her upstairs for 30 minutes don't get me wrong that's not what i'm doing but i'm saying um i'll let her have that option of playing up there but also set the timer for her to know like mom's not gonna be gone for five hours you know like let her know that this will end and i'll be right back another thing is i think it's really important to get your kids out outside of the house and i know with it getting colder out and with the pandemic it's a little bit harder but even just going on a five-minute walk um i believe it was maria montessori that said this but there's no such thing as inappropriate weather just inappropriate clothing so we have a playhouse for alathia and we wanted to put it in storage but i was like you know what let's keep it out because she has actually really enjoyed going out there and we live in michigan so it will get really cold but if we're wearing hats and gloves and layered and warm shoes and warm things like it you can stay outside for like 10 minutes so she really enjoys doing that i found that when she does get to go outside and explore and play with the sticks and the leaves and the grass and nature like she's just such a happier baby um and i'll also bring baskets with us so i have a little basket and sometimes we'll want to walk and i'll ask her to pick out leaves or pick out branches we call them our nature walks or toddler walks what i feel like i used to do them a lot in the summer before i had ari what was the name of them what did i call them do you guys remember i posted on my stories all the time but basically it's just like a walk where your child indicates and kind of takes control of the walk so they determine the speed that you walk they determine where you walk how long you walk um all sorts of things so basically your intention isn't really to walk a mile it's basically your intention is to let your child lead so i'll normally walk behind her behind her or beside her i'll let her pick where we go where we stop if she sees something or hear something and i'll kind of just let her take it all in sometimes i'll ask her questions or like if i hear a bird i'll be like oh what do you think that noise is or like just kind of like ask her questions to kind of get her thinking and like soaking in what's going on in the environment around us honestly i think that's all i had to mention i was just gonna elaborate a little bit more on her toys um and we do follow montessori i feel like a broken record i say this all the time but one of the things that they do is open shelving that is at a low accessible height for your kids and this is such a game changer because she is able to get to her toys and pick out the toys that she wants to play with she doesn't have to ask me she'll have to grab me and like say i want to play with this she can just get it herself and play with it put it where she wants it do the thing and i'm over here like oh great this is fabulous um so we do have that set up in her play room but in addition down here i do have two little bins one for aria and one for alecia hers are actually only filled with books down here um i used to have toys but i really wanted to keep toys all designated in one spot so i've only put books down here and she will grab them and she'll ask to read them on the couch um and she's just really fallen in love with books and when she was a baby i used to read books to her at least eight books a day and i know that sounds kind of excessive and looking back i'm like how did i have time to do that but i really think it's helped and set a foundation of the way that she is right now because she is a book worm this child loves to read a book like if you never know what to do with her grab a book and start reading it and she'll calm down and sit and enjoy it so i really think like learning getting them into the habit of reading all every day at a really young age really helps um because i'm really seeing a difference with ari poor thing i haven't had that much time to read to him i feel like i just don't think to do that anymore as much as i did with alathia i'm trying to read more to him but i definitely feel like that helped to lazy a lot so those are my hacks for you guys i will have links to our tower and like other assortments um the wedges and all of that that i feel like will be really helpful and resourceful i also have a gift guide up for the age of zero to two years old i basically collected all of my favorite toys that my kids use and adore and put them all in a gift guide and the prices range from five dollars all the way to 160 dollars so there's definitely a price um whatever your budget is there's definitely something in there for you as well so i'll link that down below and my other gentle parenting and intentional parenting videos but i hope you guys enjoy this i love you and i'll see you my next video if i don't get my jesus time and sour patch this yeah i'm like   yeah all right guys let's do this let's do 2021. this video i am going to be highlighting some things that i will be keeping in 2020 we're not gonna dress her we're gonna leave her there we aren't going to miss her what i'm going to be doing different in 2021 this is my first video of the year i haven't filmed a video and what seems like a really long time i kind of slowed down in december if you guys had a good christmas i hope you're excited for the new year i've tried filming this video so many times it's been very frustrating i don't know what the enemy wants for me today but it's like go away i don't need you today i i want to start my year off right you know if this is your first time here hi welcome i'm elena if you've been here before and you're not yet subscribed make sure to subscribe down below before we get started um yeah i'm gonna make this like super low pressure very chill i had filmed this two times already and i was doing it in my office and it was very like lights camera action very like production-ish and then jordan was like people don't like that and i was like i guess you're right so i'm up here in my bedroom that's where i sleep that's where my pjs are so hopefully you feel nice and cozy and in my home i'm gonna kind of break this down into different categories so we can start off with like my goals and then i was going to touch on like goals that i have as being a mother as being a christian a wife my work life i feel like there's like different categories of where i have certain goals or certain things that i'm leaving in 2020 so let's start off with our jesus time so i feel like for a lot of us it was really hard to have our jesus time in 2020 churches shut down um i was pregnant last year for half of the year and then i had like a new baby the other half of the year so it was i was just like not in a routine it was just very difficult for me and i'm all about routines like all about the routines and i love i love starting off my mornings with spending my time with the lord i'm a major morning person and like how i spend my morning it definitely sets the tone for the rest of the day if i get my jesus time in the morning i'm such a nicer person if i don't get my jesus time i'm a sour patch one of the things i'm leaving in 2020 is my lack of time with jesus i will be spending my time with the lord this year you guys are probably like yep on the same boat sis we're in this together now what are we gonna do about it you know what are we gonna do different this time i'm gonna share with you guys what i'm gonna do maybe this will encourage you maybe you think i'm crazy but i am not going to allow myself to touch my phone until i first touch my bible and when i say touch i don't mean touch my bible and then run upstairs and grab my phone and start using it i mean touch my bible and like read my bible spend the time with the lord um this is something that i think will be pretty easy for me to kind of stick to it will be something that um is kind of measurable and will kind of push me i need that push i need that push i feel like we all kind of need that little umph and it might be a little hard at first but after a couple of weeks i think i'll just naturally get used to it so my phone is my alarm clock so naturally first thing that i touch is normally my phone but after i disable my alarm i tend to go on instagram i like to scroll for 15 minutes but like at six in the morning what am i scrolling and looking at like i'm half awake at that time so i don't think that time is necessary on instagram i definitely think that's a time for me to make my coffee and then go and spend time with the lord so that is one thing i'm going to be doing since we're on the topic of faith another thing that i am striving to do is get into a bible study or just more community so jordan i did switch churches last year and i have yet to really connect myself in that church yet it's been really difficult with the kids because when i do go to service they've had a hard time going to child care so most of the time i'm like with the kids and so it's been hard to connect it's been hard to find other people so that is one of my goals is to just connect serve in the church um and just get to know other people and have fellowship that was definitely something that i really needed in 2020 and i know church is just a building but there's just something about fellowship and having community and just like physically seeing people and being with people and worshiping with other people that is just something that i cannot live without like to me that is essential so definitely want to get myself involved a little bit more those are honestly the only two things that i have for faith now let's move on to like work i tend to overwork myself i feel like because of my job it's so easy to just like make it a 24-hour thing um because it's really hard to like unplug and kind of like say like okay what's my personal time or like what's me actually working so i would ideally like to work a nine to five and set those hours and stick within those hours that's something that i tend to struggle with and dave ramsey if you guys are familiar with him he is all about um finances jordan is obsessed with him jordan will drink a cup of coffee and watch dave ramsey every morning it's like the most dad thing that he does but dave always has a little sprinkles of wisdom and sprinkles of goodness here and there and one thing he said was about balance he said you will never have balance because it's just not realistic and that's something i held on to in 2020 and i'm going to continue and carry that into this year but i always was hard on myself previously for like devoting too much time to my kids and not enough to work or too much to work and not with my kids like like this back and forth of like certain things and things won't really ever be balanced and that's okay there's certain seasons where your kids like when ari was a newborn i had to put work on the back burner and devote a lot more time to him or now that certain things are launching or i'm preparing for certain things like work is more of the front load things and other things are not getting as like aren't balanced as much as they could have or once were if that makes sense so to think that everything will perfectly be balanced is unrealistic because certain things call for certain attention during certain seasons so i'm just bringing that along this year as well i also want to get dressed every day now 2020 was definitely the year where loungewear sweatpants every day became like socially acceptable but like honestly very cute and i was obsessed with that but this year i want to make more of an effort to actually get dressed you know kind of wear stuff like this you know because it's so easy to just like be lounging all day and then you just want to cozy up in your bed and then you just want to sleep all day like it's really easy to just like so for me i would just want to make more of an effort to dress up more every day i'd like to leave the house a little bit more i struggle so bad with leaving the house and this was before quarantine before cove it happened because i feel like it's i don't really need to when i work from home i have two young kids for me to get out the door it's such an ordeal and such a process that i'm just like i'm just gonna insta card like why am i gonna do the hassle of doing that and i've definitely found that that has really affected my mental health because i only see my toddler in my dogs all day and i need to see other people i need to see other humans i need to see other faces so i am going to make more of an effort to just go out more like whether it means going on a walk or going to a park or like driving somewhere or just driving and getting a coffee by myself really quickly just like little things to make my days seem a little bit different um and also go outside more so we went on a walk this morning i live in michigan it's like really gray outside today it's snowing it's not like the most ideal weather like if i lived in florida i feel like i would be such a happier person because i love the sun but that's not my deal so i'm gonna pretend the sun is out i'm gonna pretend it's beautiful out but i went on a walk this morning with alathia it was nice it wasn't that cold we were dressed appropriately and it was just nice to get fresh air and just like be in nature hear birds chirping and snow melting i don't really know michigan right now is kind of but but still i'm trying to like see the good side of it continuing kind of the topic of work and more so like my goals for this year i definitely want to continue fearing the lord and that people i feel like i preach that anthem all of 2020 but i just want to continue that because i feel like it some days it's really easy and some days it's really hard so it's just kind of like this constant battle of mine but yeah definitely just fearing the lord over people's opinions people's perspective like i feel like this day and age we put way too much focus on what people think instead of what the lord thinks so my focus is on i'm also going to try and read a book every month jordan actually mentioned this yesterday on our date night and i was like that's a really good idea so i would like to stop spending so much time on my phone and i feel like at the end of the day after putting the kids to bed that is when i'm on my phone the most because i finally get to catch up on everything and while i love that time i want to limit it so i'm going to start setting timers on my phone at the end of the day 30 minutes on the timer where i can just like answer dms answer questions whatever just like get those done and then i want to read a book because i know that being on your phone right before you go to sleep is not the best thing and for me it just makes my mind race and because like let's say i see a really hateful comment like that will just sit on my mind and then it's just like annoying it's like okay i could have totally avoided and not seen that i would have been such on a happier note like overall i feel like it will just help my mental health a lot more i feel like a common thing is like my own mental health and i mentioned it in my pamper video but i have struggled with postpartum depression so that's definitely been something i've been having to navigate through and really a big thing that is kind of like the top of this year and then everything else kind of trickles down and like the reason for all these other things is because of the postpartum depression so that's something i'm navigating towards um i will make a video on this once i'm ready and like once i feel like i'm at a good spot um but yeah i'll elaborate more on that later and then just to kind of finish off i would say is my marriage so last year i was uber pregnant and then postpartum so i wasn't like jordan and i were kind of in this weird spot where our time together and our intimacy and like sex was like kind of like not a priority because of the circumstances so this yeah i'm like yeah that's not going to happen again so definitely want to make that more of a priority but we are going to do an entire podcast on things we are changing in our marriage this year or things that we like are going to be doing different um so i will let you guys know once that is up but i'll link our podcast down below if you want to catch up on older episodes and stuff but yeah i definitely just want to focus on our marriage this year because having two kids back to back obviously our marriage was like not really the biggest priority i feel like last year i was just in survival mode just like so many of us um i was kind of just like autopilot like okay feed the kids make sure the kids shower every day make sure the house doesn't catch on fire make sure like we can all breathe like it was just kind of like a fight mode all the time and i feel like towards the end of the year i was like feeling so exhausted because that's good so exhausting and so mundane so this year i'm just trying to be more intentional um i've been trying to figure out like what my word of the year is this year and at first i was saying energy but not in the way of like vibes i meant like just want to be very selective of what i put my energy into so spending time with my kids or spending time with my husband spending time with jesus like just being very selective of what i give my time and attention to and if i see that something starts to become toxic or just like is not very productive then out goodbye not spending my energy on that um yeah just being very selective of that but those are kind of my goals for this year kind of what i'm striving for what i'm keeping in 2020 what i'm bringing along with me this year and what my goals and plans are let me know down below what you guys are keeping in 2020 anything that's toxic anything that is just not required of your energy this year let me know down below hope you guys enjoyed this video and i will see you in my next one i'm gonna squeeze last month the average amount of sleep we got was two hours and 50 minutes every night and that is not enough sleep at all like i don't care who you are hey guys happy new year first vlog of the year i thought i'd show off what i'm wearing today i actually just got an order from zara i just got two pairs of jeans and then like leather pants because i'm always on the lookout for cute jeans and i actually bought them in store but you can't try mine so i got the wrong size i got a size six is too small these are a size 8 and i feel like it's that perfect fit i wanted it bigger because this material is very like jean like not stretchy at all um and it's like a momfit i'll link them down below there's 35 bucks which is pretty affordable compared to like other things that are out there and i just really like this fit so this is what i'm wearing today and then this top is super old from target i think or something then i just have a little bit of jewelry on but these are the other ones that i got so i got this i've been really into leather pants for some reason because i feel like they're a more dressy but still comfortable version of leggings and then i got these mom jeans in a black so this is the size that i got um and that's what those look like so it's basically the same one as these just in black hairy are you snapping what are you doing are you wearing a diaper nope are you getting potty changed yup no apply it where do you patty know you're gonna go naps jordan is putting elenathia down i'm gonna play with audi he just woke up from his nap so we've gotten him out of schedule guys we have got him on the schedule he loves the camera what is that funny looking thing hi are you playing all by yourself in your room you're so big okay i've been having such a bad hair week because i only wash my hair once a week so like if it doesn't look good when i wash it then i'm basically stuck with it for the rest of the week so i've been like really struggling i need to just put on a beanie but um yeah today is just gonna be kind of a catch-up life update sharing with you guys what's been going on so we ended up hiring a night nurse um i'll talk about her more in a little bit but one of the key things that we needed to do was get him on a schedule and so i shared this on my instagram but i made this cute little graphic on canva and it includes his schedule and then i have his nap routine and his nighttime routine so whoever is here like me or jordan or my mom or jordan's mom whoever is like with the kids we all can look at this and refer back to this to know like exactly what time he's supposed to be doing what because with two kids it's a little bit hard to figure out like okay what's a lacie's schedule what's our schedule like what should they be doing right now and then that way we don't have to keep asking ourselves i don't have to keep getting interrupted when i'm like doing something if they have a question i can remind myself because sometimes i forget to so um a lot of you on instagram were asking if i could send this to you and i'm actually going to make this into a template and send it to you guys so i do have a newsletter that's coming out in the next couple of weeks and this was going to be one of the first things i was going to include in it so it'll just be like a template just like this we'll have this on it and then you can just switch it out for your child's name your child's routine but like the overall cuteness is all there so i'll have that link down below if you guys want to join the newsletter but yeah sticking to a schedule during the day has been super important so right now with his play time and he really did not like this room because it was associated with being alone and not with me so we've been trying to play in here and let him like feel happy in here to make him like this space um and another another big thing that we're doing that just started today is potty training alathia and i started doing this i was actually vlogging the day i started it too but i think she was 15 months old or 16 months old and she pooped in the pantry and peed in the pantry and i was not ready i was like nope we're not doing this i she was probably ready but i just wasn't and that's normally the biggest thing is the parent isn't ready so yesterday she actually pooped in her potty and then i told her night nurse and she also trains toddlers on potty training and she was like if she's showing you signs and she's continuing this then you should start it while it's here okay so i was like okay we'll we'll try it so this morning we're doing the no pants method that's the one that she suggested not for you for yeah and basically you just don't have them wear any pants so if they do start going to the bathroom they'll feel that they'll stop it and then go into the proper space so she's already peed three times in the potty she pooped in it too um she's obviously had a couple of accidents because she it's her first day so like she'll start to pee and then stop herself and say that she's peeing and stop and then she'll go to the potty and continue so that's been really good she peed on ari's play mat downstairs fun and then she peed on her tower but she stopped it was just a little just a little bit we love cleaning i know i'm already we're already cleaning the dogs pee and poop because sometimes we'll have accidents in the house so what's going on i know like what it's fine it's not a big deal so i'm excited to continue this i'll keep you guys updated i'll probably do an entire video on that but that's what's going on today um jordan has a couple of work things to do i was gonna go get my eyelashes done today so this is something i am going to continue i feel like everyone in 2020 is like oh i'm gonna like be low maintenance like i'm gonna minimize i'm over here like let's do it all like i keep adding stuff to my list but um i got my eyelashes permed how long ago was that three months ago it was a while back and i'm gonna get them read done so i'm gonna do that today i'll bring you guys a little youtube definition really where i have yet to work out this week actually and i said i was gonna work out every morning i haven't done that yet i said i was gonna give my body in a week of adjusting to waking up early first so i've been waking up early and doing my jesus time i haven't incorporated the workout yet i'm mentally preparing myself for that so yes we love a good mental preparation yeah i need to mentally prepare myself to work out mentally prepare myself not to eat junk food anymore i don't really eat junk food i just like eat whatever i want you gotta get a plan yeah yeah so i like in the morning instead of having like two pieces of hash brown i've just been having one piece of hash brown or like instead of two pieces of toast just one but like i'm still full i had a whole avocado this morning and that really filled me up hi he's trying so hard to crawl hi show them show them you can do it you can do it head shoulder knees and toes knees and toes head shoulder knees and toes knees nose and eyes easy nose head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes okay i'm actually getting ready to go i literally just plopped ari right there for a second i'm gonna grab a snack i'm grabbing these schoolyard snacks these are some of our favorites especially alecia's i keep them down here so she can reach them um but she'll just like grab one of these and pull it up on her tower um but yeah she was eating them earlier today she didn't quite get to finish yet because she wanted to take her bottle um isn't that what it's like to be a dad it's always just eating and finishing your child's snacks it's dead ticks dead tax yeah dad tax to the max um if we don't pay enough taxes do you like are you just sitting there whoa hi but they are sponsoring today's video so i'm always trying to get alecia healthy snacks but she loves like those more unhealthier things so i always try to find little alternatives they are so crunchy i think that's why elenation likes them the most asmr um but these are keto low calorie they also are gluten and grain free soy nut free gmo free and they don't have anything artificial in it but it still tastes really good like she still really enjoys these um so does jordan so do i they also have tons of different flavors so these specifically are the keto puffs they also have the flaming cheeto one they also have cereal well i actually grabbed that as well here's the cereal one it's peanut butter it's so yummy i really enjoy peanut butter and cereals and stuff but yeah i think they're so cute and like such vintage looking packages but at least you'll just grab one of these you guys know i make her be independent and make her like grab her own snacks and stuff so she always gravitates towards this because it's her favorite and right where she needs to get it in the open just sorry i'm going to be very crunchy because they're very crunchy it's hard to like not be crunchy but they're so cute small cute little portions i like that it's portioned out too because i tend to be the person that will grab multiple handfuls of whatever snack it is that i'm eating so this keeps me limited also keeps a lathe limited because ma'am gets mad at me if i don't give her more than one huge handful so this she knows once this bag is done she's done with her snap um so i'm gonna have a link down below they always sell out so grab that link down below you can get 10 off and free shipping so use my code check it out um and grab them before they sell out okay i have to head out in a second to go to my appointment but i was going to show jordan this picture of a credenza or a sideboard because i chick like the board you got on the side no your main board   okay so right here where we have this mirror i've been thinking about adding a sideboard or a credenza or like um i keep using these terms i'm trying to find something to like put our silver not silver we don't have silver our dishes like our serving dishes on um because they take up a lot of space but they're actually all really pretty so i wanted to have them somewhat displayed and i thought right here would be the perfect spot if it's not too bulky and that's the thing i'll probably have to order one try it out if we don't like it we can give it back but i'm thinking of putting it like right here preferably under the mirror obviously but hopefully it doesn't stick out too much but here's some pictures careful and starvers aries just been now getting used to the dogs and like noticing them you see them ignore these prices because i just went on studio mcgee's website but something like this um i actually really like this one i wouldn't pay this price but i like how it's glass so i feel like it fit right there look something like this yeah it can't be too bulky though because there's already not a lot of room to walk i know i was thinking maybe like a two feet like how that one is but a little bit like 12 inches yeah maybe just just like a little bit and if anything we can push that table more well i feel like it's not going to flip it off over there i thought about that too but above yourself under there functionality but this is functional right are you taught that it is functional but if we already have functions i don't know i think it'd look cute this wall seems very blank to me and chris loves julia has one so i need to have one too okay i just got them done um i did a lamination on my brows which is basically like a product that just holds your brows up so they do look pretty full because they're still like the product on them and then i also did get my eyelashes permed um i really like it and then i feel like i'm not gonna have to fill in my eyebrows anymore and this lasts um six to eight weeks so i just thought on my drive back home i would just update you guys on the night nurse and how that's been why we did it just give you guys all the details on it so i did a little um question box on instagram and i'm just gonna answer some of those questions so biggest question we got is why we decided to do it and not with alecia so the difference with a leafy and ari has been that ari is a very like lovey-dovey baby he's just like such a snuggler such a boy and um he just loves us so in the middle of the night if he starts crying guess what brings some comfort we do and i loved that i was all about it i was so into it we were bed sharing for a while and then the lack of sleep really started to catch up on us and it just got to the point where he wasn't able to self-soothe in any way whatsoever last month the average amount of sleep we got was two hours and 50 minutes every night and that is not enough sleep at all like i don't care who you are but like for me definitely not and the biggest reason why we didn't end up doing any of this with alethia was because she wasn't a lovey-dovey baby she's very independent from the beginning and she was able to like self-soothe on her own she didn't cry for us like we used the taking care baby sleep training program and we never even had to have her cried out because she figured it out right from the start but mr ari we tried it we tried so many other things we tried all these sleep sacks all these different methods we tried the bed sharing we tried so many things and we were still consistently being woken up at night and we just felt like zombies and we were so tired and it was really like messing with our mental health and then because i have olathe too like it's not like i can just sleep during the day so if ari was an only child i definitely don't think i would have gotten a night nurse but because when i wake up during the day like i still have to get up and have a like 16 hour day with my very talkative toddler um it became really challenging so that's why we decided to do it and then another thing that i got was like okay what does she do so she in particular her name is leslie we hired her through the night owl and honestly jordan just googled like the night nurse and whatever came up is what he used so um night owl is actually located in denver and so they're like supposed to hug you with people in denver so it's kind of weird that we ended up finding leslie because we're in michigan so she's also in michigan she's in ann arbor so it worked out perfectly and this is why i think it was such a god thing because joe and i were just so tired i was just praying every night literally every night all i prayed was to be able to sleep and to have my baby be comforted and soothed and leslie was honestly an answered prayer so um what was i saying i lose my train of thought way too frequently um um so what she does okay so when we first decided to do this i had joked around about it quite a few times because i follow a blogger her name is stefan and when she had her daughter capri she hired a night nurse from the age of zero to three months i think or four months and she raved about it she said it was like the best thing she ever did and i was so curious about it because i'm like how does that even work like isn't that strange having a person like sleeping your home but honestly once you reach a point of exhaustion where you're not sleeping more than three hours i feel like you're willing to do anything at least jordan and i were we're like i'm willing to try anything like at this point we're so tired and so when jordan booked it they called my mom and i was like mom we're so excited like we booked a night nurse and she's coming tomorrow and my mom like every mom was like um who is she did you interview her like have you met her yet like what is she gonna do when you're sleeping my mom came up with all these questions and i was like oh my gosh like she's so right i didn't even think about those because i was just so tired so um that's right and i keep saying like it was such a bad thing because leslie is a christian she's amazing she's also a doula she works with child like with children she does children behavior um she does all types of things she's a postpartum doula like she's just all around an incredible woman hope you can still see me i don't know if my camera is like moving around or not but um she's the best like she's really changed our life and had such a great impact on us so i'll leave her stuff down below um but again we found her through night owls so you can hire a night nurse for as long as you want her availability was five or six days and honestly that's all we could afford because it is a little bit pricey i'll get to that in a second but the first day she came for 12 hours and then every other day after that she came for eight hours so the first night she came for 12 hours because we kind of had to establish a nighttime routine for ari and so she was there when we were doing her nighttime routine and she was giving us some tips and pointers so right off the bat what she had us do was conceal or like put tape on any light source in the room like his monitor had a little green light that came out the fire uh the thing on the ceiling that detects fire smoke detector that had a little green light so she had us do all that stuff right off the bat um and then she gave us a schedule to follow for ari and then we put ari to sleep and then if he woke up at any point during the night she was the one that cared for him but she was also sleep training him so she has her techniques and her things that she does i'm not going to share that because that's like her job so um and she was honestly able to do it ari has slept through the night two nights already and he's learned how to self-soothe and how to get himself back to sleep which has been amazing but the biggest thing that she's taught us is a schedule and consistency because what time they wake up in the morning and how their day is and how their naps are will really determine the night time so she helped us get ariana's schedule which has been so nice to be able to know like okay he's gonna sleep from this time to this time i can do work at this time or i can do this at this time or i can be with a lazy at this time and i've been able to spend so much time with ari because he wakes up before lazy does so the mornings are my time with jesus and my time with ari and it's been so sweet um and it's just been really nice to have consistency and have balance and have structure um so yeah that's basically what she does so yesterday was her last night so she was coming from 10 p.m until 6 a.m so any time during that time that ari was crying she would be with him um and when she would come she would help with laundry which is so sweet like that was not she didn't need to do that she would do the dishes and clean bottles and stuff she was so helpful and then she would go to sleep herself she was sleeping in our guest room and um when ari cried she would go and be with him so i one of the questions was if i felt like my privacy was invaded and no not at all um i was able to kind of turn off mom mode because i knew she was there and i knew she was caring for my kids and she was actually the first person that has ever cared for my children that aren't family the only people that have ever taken care of my kids are family and she's the first one and i had such a peace about it and i really feel like the lord she was like such a god set and the lord really brought her to our lives for a reason so i would love to hire her to be my doula for my next baby whenever that kid comes um and i'm really excited so let's see what other questions yeah i definitely didn't feel weird i was able to rest and like sleep the first couple of nights i wasn't able to sleep not because she was there but because i didn't know how to fall asleep and i don't know if this is a thing or not and if any other moms struggle with this but i really associated sleep time with anxiety and stress because any time i went to sleep i would never sleep and i would be with ari and it was a very stressful time so i'm kind of having to like unlearn that nighttime is stressful and kind of rework my brain so i've been kind of tackling through that um but yeah another question was price so each person depends and like where you live varies it ranges anywhere between forty dollars an hour to sixty dollars an hour i think it just again it just depends but we paid hourly so like i said we did eight hours twelve hours the first night just so she could see how things go and she could be there a little bit longer um but yeah it was a little bit pricey but to me it was so worth it like beyond worth it i would yeah that was not a thing so as you guys know jordan i have allowances and um we just used our allowances on that for the next couple of months but it's fine um sleep is priceless but yeah i'm almost home so once i get home i'll check back in with you guys probably gonna stop and get coffee somewhere because i have not had my afternoon coffee yet um but yeah let me know what you guys want to see from me i've been kind of in this weird funk where i really want to separate myself and like be melina again because i felt like so many of you really enjoy mommy content and i love making mommy content too but sometimes i kind of want to be melana you know like i kind of want to do fun girly things i want to do fashion videos i want to do cooking videos um and just like other things so let me know if you guys are on board with that and yeah i'll see you guys once we get home did you just wake up from here now yeah are you eating this now these are good she's having this cereal okay

you where is it can i take a bite can please take one bite just a little bite okay fine i respect it i respect it but i want to yeah hey guys welcome back to my channel never did i ever think i'd make a video like this but i've been so into cooking so into all of this it's been my jam that i thought i would share with you guys my top 10 kitchen gadgets and things that i use every single day that if you're married right now and creating a registry or if you're about to move out or you just like feel like the kitchen stuff that you have is not your vibe is not beneficial to you at all hopefully this video will help you guys i'm gonna have everything linked down below but i hope you can see my passion and my love for cooking through the screen so let's go ahead and get started the things i have in here are essentially things that i use every day like i said um a lot of them is for cooking but also like cleaning so it's all like within the kitchen gadget area so my aunt is the one that got me on this and i've mentioned it on my instagram i've gotten so many of you hooked on it but it is a cloth sponge so this is mine she's crusty and dusty but that's because i use her every day and she's just the best thing in the world one i like it because it's reusable and two because it literally gets everything off your countertops i have quartz white quartz actually so if there's any little dust any little thing you can see it so i feel like i'm constantly having to clean it and all you do is get this bad boy all wet and then yeah and it takes everything off you can also use it on glass so just put some water on it you can put some soap not if you're cleaning glass but like if you're cleaning your countertops it'll get everything right out so this is what it looks like when it's wet like i said i've been using her a lot this is what it looks like when it's dry it kind of like looks like a piece of paper and you just add water and boom it comes in a pack of five and i think it's like three dollars or something super affordable the perfect thing to clean off your countertops your stove taps literally you will catch me all day with this thing everywhere because it gets everything off so definitely one of my favorite things in the kitchen next up is going to be a cast iron now i never even thought i would be one to love cast irons honestly didn't even realize what a cast iron was until i watched tangled and she kept hitting him upside the head with that thing and jordan is the one that got me hooked on these so specifically we use these right here that is from the company called lodge and i found that these are the best ones this is the smallest one i have i actually have one that's a lot larger and i use that one every single day i know cast irons can seem really intimidating because they kind of are it's not traditional it's not like your normal type of pan um because of the cleaning but let me tell you the flavor and just like oh it's so good i like to make my meats on here i like to make my eggs on here my sausage my bacon my steaks literally everything that we make in this thing some veggies oh i make this lemon chicken on this thing and it is so good um and we follow lodge on youtube they have like a youtube channel and they have tons of videos of like how to properly clean it how to cook the best chicken in the world and we made it and they give you like little tips like putting an ice cube once it's cooked and then putting in the oven like they have these little hacks that will be the best like really like a nice crispy chicken but like moist on the inside i love it this is what has made me really enjoy cooking because i used to never cook meats and i'm not sure if you guys eat meat or not but we typically do and i was always afraid of cooking meats because i figured you couldn't do it because it'd be too overcooked or too undercooked like it was really hard to find that medium space um so i just kind of avoided it and i liked a grilled chicken instead or like a grilled steak but after making this cast iron we rarely ever really grill because it just gives you that nice crispiness you know yeah okay along side with the cast iron another thing that i cannot live without is this thermometer if you don't already have one of these stop the video and go to target and grab one real quick because this has changed the game um jordan actually went ahead it actually already wore out but on the back of this thing he had written out the temperatures for medium medium rare well done whatever like the temperature would need to be for the chicken or the meat or whatever you're making um and that made it really easy so i did it like cooking chicken because every time i did it would be so dry or like literally raw and i'm like i don't know what i'm doing i'm not gonna do it but then after this thing you can just stick this periodically in there to make sure it's at the right temperature and then that way it's always cooked never undercooked and it's never too wet so this is a game changer and then like jordan did i definitely recommend labeling the back because different meats different chicken salmon they have different temperatures so you can definitely just make like a little list on the back or like a little print out so you know every time and you're not wasting time and it makes you feel confident in the kitchen you know okay let's kind of shift gears a little bit real quick before we get into more cooking tools and that is going to be for things to preserve your food so i recently found these at ikea they come in a pack of three there's one more that's a little bit larger but basically you put this on the end of your fruits your veggies your avocados any sort of thing and it just saves it it's like a preserver and it's so nice because it's reusable and it's always the perfect shape and it seals it so tight and i also put it over any like small bowls or anything like that i really enjoyed these i don't know how i lived without them and they're like three dollars at tarte at ikea so if you have an ikea in your area definitely place an order i have three of these sets and use them every single day okay last thing and i'm so late to the game but that is reusable zip locks um i love these for storing like onions or like chopped up onions or just like leftover food i've had corn in this that i had already cooked um it just is so nice because it's reusable and it's really easy to wash i got mine off of thrive market but the company is re-zip i see these at target all the time they are a little bit more on the pricier side but long run better for the environment you are going to end up saving money because you don't have to keep rebuying it and you can just reuse it so i recommend okay last last little topic and these i've been looking for something like this for years and i didn't know that it was a thing until um mallory irvin posted about it and i was obsessed so these are little ceramic berry carriers berry holders whatever you want to call them and this is for you to put your fruits and veggies inside of so i store like blackberries blueberries strawberries any of our berries in these i have three of them so i'll wash them let them dry and then put them in here the key is to let them dry if you don't have them fully dried it's a lot easier for the mold to like get up in there and ruin all your fruits and veggies but i like this because then that way i can see my fruit and veggies i can remember i have strawberries and then i eat them olathe eats them it's fabulous so and i like how it's not plastic we can get rid of all that plastic stuff so i like this switching gears back into the actual cooking stuff so i know i mentioned to you guys the cast iron now another thing that kind of goes alongside with the cast iron is this splash guard now this isn't just for the cast iron i mean it's for any time that you cook but i've noticed anytime i particularly use the cast iron with any meats or if i'm ever searing something it can get a little bit messy and i'm not trying to clean my stove every day you know i'm just i'm at that point i'm lazy okay so i like this because it catches all the stuff so you basically here's your this is my workout for the day by the way this thing is heavy this is your cast iron you toss this guy on top honestly i don't know which side is the front or the back probably this one but you just put it on like that and it just stops everything from splashing and it's the best and then once i'm done i just like rinse this off or just throw in the dishwasher and it's all clean and set to go for the next day so they have different sizes honestly i don't know where jordan got this one it's kitchenaid so it's probably at target best buy not best buy bed bath and beyond um yeah but a lot of this stuff i don't think i mentioned in the beginning of the video but most of these things we actually got from when we like first got married from our registry i spent a lot of time on our registry and people were so gracious and gifted us so a lot of stuff is from there let's not get into cutting i would argue now listen i am not this is why i'm saying i was like never did i think i'd make this video because i'm not like the cooking type you know i don't like sit and watch who makes cooking videos i don't even know like cooking videos i don't really do that i just find a recipe on pinterest and i just follow the recipe and i feel like from cooking so much i've learned what i really like and don't like it might not be like exactly what you're supposed to be doing but it's worked for me my food tastes great ask my family and i don't spend that much time so i feel like a lot of this stuff is like hacks simple things to just make your life a little bit easier in the kitchen and make you more comfortable with your cooking so i would argue that knives don't matter i think what matters is how you sharpen your knife because you can make any knife super sharp so we do have the kaflon knives i'll link them down below but they don't work if they're not sharpened pretty simple you know and now this thing i don't even know what this is called babe what is this knife cutting thing called sharpening stone so jordan do you want to explain it honey sure here comes his dad his inner dad is coming out now jordan goes through phrases where he's obsessed with things for a while he was obsessed with sharpening knives so explain yeah so this is a whetstone um basically which juicy soaked this in water fully submerged for like a few hours to overnight and there's different grits on here so you have like a 6000 and a 1000 just like finer grit or kind of how sharp you want to get your knife so what you do is you set this down once it's been submerged and you take the knife at an angle and you start kind of going back and forth and there's different techniques you could do you could do like american version or the japanese version then you flip it over and do the other side and it's kind of like therapeutic it's kind of uh soothing to do so i'll sit there for like 30 40 minutes sharpening a knife really it takes that long i mean it can you could probably do it less but it depends on how dull the knife is and yeah i guess how much you want to do it so yeah i'll usually just do that like once a month and then we get nice sharp knives and there's also i can't remember the name of it honing it it's called oh that's like with that's what my dad used to use it's like that like stick thing that you can use but basically to say that i feel like you could get some knives from ikea that are pretty affordable and sharpen them really well and have them work just as well as like a 300 knife which is insane that that's how much they can cost yeah and i'm not like some knife expert but kind of just like pick up things along the way now so he has to know these things so yeah keep your knife sharp and there's actually less chance of you cutting yourself because you're going to cut what you want to cut yeah exactly i'll link some of the videos that jordan wants to learn how to do this again dad 101 right here um but yeah knife spiel is done um in addition to a knife i love a good cutting board and i have found that i like these plastic ones more these are from ikea i do have my fair share of wooden cutting boards and those are great for um different things but i found like every time i just need to cut an onion or something i just gravitate towards this because it's easier to clean and i like this size but i will just add i love using cutting boards as serving plates or as like an actual plate just to cut on stuff and to serve especially alathia i recently found these at home goods and a lot of these things you guys can't find at home goods it's just like you need to look out for it so i always have to cut stuff for a lathe yeah or she cuts stuff herself so i found these like smaller looking ones it's super cute and what i'll do is she wants strawberries or something i'll just chop it up and hand it right to her on this cutting board because she can just eat right off of it um and yeah i feel like this has helped and i'm not having to like waste dishes or like clean extra because i'm not trying to clean more so this has been really useful and i'm just going to throw this in there in case any of you have toddlers um this this won't really count as a top 10 again unless you have a child that is a toddler but i also have this wedger that i use for alathia so i'll give her this and a banana or something and she'll actually cut her own food it's safe because it's not very sharp and it's really easy for them to do it themselves so if you are independently teaching your child how to cut this is a really good starting tool so i'll also link any of my um independent toddlers or like how to have independent babies videos down below if you guys are curious but yeah definitely recommend this little ledger okay next thing so if you are currently unsatisfied with your pans or pan set that you have if you are to repurchase i just cannot recommend stainless steel this has been a game changer for me so when i first got married i wanted the non-stick i was like mom i'm not dealing with the stainless steel i want to cook my eggs flip my eggs nothing sticks i want it to be easy now non-stick is really easy but if you get a scratch in it um the chemicals and stuff that are in there you just have to toss it and it's bad for you whatever stainless steel though this girl will be with you until you die like this thing will last years and years and years to come it's so easy to clean and i have noticed that with um eggs all you have to do is heat it up first like the pan has to be hot then add whatever thing it is that you need like an oil butter whatever and then do your egg and it won't stick so there definitely is a technique to it um but yeah i can't live without this and this one in particular um these are kaflon this is a 12 inch and this and our 12 inch or 15 inch cast iron are my most used things so normally i'll do like my chicken steak whatever meat i'm making and then any vegetable saute anything like that goes in the sky um and one more bonus i know i'm sorry one more bonus um for cleaning that i recently found this vlogger her name is anne richards and i absolutely love her like she's like my mommy blogger online the stuff that she posts is so useful so she mentioned this product right here it's all like not i don't think it's um it's all natural there's no harsh chemicals in this this has made my stainless steel so shiny um it was never this shiny until i got this product so you just like sprinkle a little bit of water sprinkle this powder on there boom your pans will look so nice same with like anything that you have in the kitchen that's stainless steel okay last thing i know i said this was only top ten i threw a couple in there that were extra it's fine um and that is this right here this i put on top of my baking sheets baking pans anytime i'm sauteing vegetables or doing anything i put this on top of it i do have the off-brand of it um i know there's one that's italian that's all fancy and stuff um but basically this is like a replacement for aluminum so i stopped cooking with aluminum a long time ago because that ends up in your food so this is a great alternative it makes it so much easier to clean so much easier to get your veggies off and like just add olive oil whatever you end up doing but i definitely recommend this i think i got this one off of amazon they do have the original one on uh bed bath and beyond website and i do really like it but i also like this one um i was a dum-dum and i was using the broiler which you're not supposed to use when you have this and i didn't realize what a broiler does i didn't realize how hot that thing actually gets like you literally have to watch it on the minute and i left it in there for too long and it like completely burned this thing to a crisp so i've been using this one for about two months now i think it's pretty much the same the other one is a lot pricier so i'll link both of them down below though if you want or if you have like a coupon for bed bath and beyond use your coupon a lot of these i feel like you can find at the beth and beyond or amazon whatever i'll have everything linked down below but hope you guys enjoyed this video i will be doing more cooking videos some of you suggested doing a cooking asmr video which i would love to do i did my like tanning routine asmr video so i'll link that up here for you guys but yeah i hope you enjoyed this and i'll see you my next video   bye hey guys welcome back to my channel i'm standing up while i film this video yes i have sweat marks on my pets like i don't even know i'm not even sweating that's just like life pregnancy it made me really sweaty after having kids it made me really sweaty so um sarah terese always stands up in her videos and i was like i want to stand up in my videos i feel like i spend so much time sitting on my butt that i wanted to do something setting up so i did get a new camera did you guys notice the quality i'm going to show you guys today what my body looks like after having two kids back to back i did a video like this right after i had my daughter um i think i was like four or five months postpartum maybe six months postpartum i can't remember i'll link that video down below but i'm going to do that same thing again my son turned seven months yesterday so it's been seven months since i had him and him and my daughter are 16 months apart when aletheia was seven months old that's when i got pregnant with him so to put things into perspective like how long i waited my daughter was seven months old when i got pregnant again my body didn't have much of a break and i definitely noticed a lot of differences between this pregnancy and the last pregnancy how my body's adjusted and how things have been since having the two kids so i thought that's what this video would be it is kind of a vulnerable video but who cares we all have pudgy tummies like honestly that's normal let's normalize that okay if you haven't already subscribed make sure to do so down below give this video a thumbs up if you want more mommy videos like this or more like vulnerable ish type videos this time around i already had the extra weight i already had the extra skin i already had the stretch marks i already had all of these things so honestly getting pregnant the second time around was not as hard as the first time with the first time i had a hard time adjusting to the weight gain i had a hard time adjusting to all of those things pregnancy is beautiful and this is something i touch on in that video but the whole process of being pregnant is seen as a very beautiful stage but the second women are done and not pregnant anymore and birth that kid everyone's like all right mama let's see what you can do make it go back to how it used to be and you're like what and suddenly this body that was so beautiful and so elegant suddenly turns into this saggy mushy bag and it's like it's still beautiful so i definitely noticed that this time around i knew what was gonna happen i knew things were gonna get saggy i knew things were gonna stretch and i was okay with that so this time around i did not have an issue with all of that but um i started showing a lot sooner so i started showing honestly at like 10 weeks i'll try to insert a picture if i can find one but most of my bump photos i actually end up doing naked because i feel like you can see the bump a little bit better and it's more so for me like i'll never post that on social media but i'll try to find one that i'm not naked in but i started showing a lot sooner my uterus was like oh we're doing this again let's do this stretch they like my uterus knew exactly what to do most of the time when you're pregnant the first time around your body is doing everything for the first time stretching for the first time so it takes the body your body a little bit of time to figure out what to do so i started showing a lot sooner my bump got quite a lot bigger i surprisingly carried the exact same a lot of people asked because i had a girl and a boy like did the pregnancies feel different and honestly no they felt the exact same to me my body really responds the same way regardless of gender um i don't know how much of an importance that would have on your pregnancy but to me my body was like the exact same so i was super nauseous in the beginning um i started showing really early i carry the same way i carry very very low which is something i'll talk in a little bit about because it kind of affects my stretch marks um but my breast grew a lot and just everything was basically the exact same yeah it's actually side tangent i had a dream last night it wasn't so much of a dream it's actually more so of a nightmare but i had a dream that i was pregnant again it was my third pregnancy and i had a midwife and a doula this time around and i kid you not i had to i labored and had my baby right here on the floor i don't know why that happened my dream but my midwife my doula no one made it in time i literally burned my baby was holding my baby i couldn't birth my placenta and then they came it was like the strangest dream ever i don't know why i just mentioned that but yeah it was weird because i like birthed my baby right here which is like where i'm standing right now but yeah it was just quite the strange dream but um it's been kind of weird because now that already is seven months old like i've been thinking and having to fight the idea of being pregnant right now because i was pregnant this time around last time with alathia and so i've been kind of like oh i don't want to be pregnant right now but then reality kicks and i'm like nope we're not doing three under three that does not sound like a good time um that's just not my cup of tea i definitely want to wait until ari is at least two years old um and then once that kid is born then we want to have those two 16 months apart as well or like closer in age so it's like two and two if that makes sense again i say this as if i have any control lord willing for all of these things but yeah okay let's just jump back into it i know i get on tangents i guess i'll just go into the obvious so i feel like stretch marks is something that a lot of women fear i don't really know why i think it plays a lot of things play into this and genetics is definitely one of them lotions and creams and i'll just be honest i was really bad with these i already had stretch marks so i was like i don't really care if i get any more and honestly that was okay with me and i did end up getting quite a lot of stretch marks with ari um but really in that lower region so because my tummy was so low it was all this pressure like right at the bottom half so when you looked at me from the front you couldn't necessarily see it because my tummy was so low it was like kind of underneath and in that area um i also got a lot of stretch marks on the side of my breast and then the side of my legs and the inside of my legs this was a new one i have very like purpley um stretch marks on the inside of my legs now so i never went back to my original weight before i got pregnant like ever um before i got pregnant i think i was extremely underweight i think i was too skinny and if you've ever seen my videos from back then um i definitely do think i could have like gained a pound or two so i never ever went back to like my original weight i guess i don't even know i think i did but my body was different that it i was carrying weight differently i think i was the same weight but i didn't look the exact same so i'm not one to measure myself on the scale i don't really care what the scale says i follow whitney simmons and this is something she always preaches about and i 100 agree with her i think it's really easy to get obsessed with the weight and obsessed with what the scale says that we don't really focus and look at how we feel and for me the biggest thing is like how do i feel right now how do i look do i like how i look great if i don't i can do something about it if i love it then great we're going to continue what we're doing i don't think the scale is a very consistent weight like sometimes you can literally just go and poop and you'll lose 10 pounds it's like okay maybe not 10 pounds maybe like one or two pounds but it's like it just fluctuates too much for your like mental health to be consistent and for your mental health to like depend on that so overall i just kind of avoid the scale i did actually gain less weight with ari than i did with lathia i think mainly because i had a baby to carry and a baby to take care of and then a toddler so alathia was like a baby in the first half of my pregnancy and then like a full-blown toddler like acting like a teenager towards the end so she definitely kept me busy i wasn't able to like really nap during the day i wasn't able to just like kind of relax so i was always like on the go and i feel like that contributed to me not gaining as much weight as before um but then when it came to after my body honestly like went back and like felt more normal than it did than with my first pregnancy so for my first pregnancy i looked about four to five months pregnant for a good like two months like i still had quite the tummy but with ari my son the second one i felt like my stomach went down pretty like liquid within like two to three weeks i feel like i was already like back to normal and you couldn't really tell that i i looked kind of like two to three months ish pregnant like it wasn't as gradual now this is something that blew my mind when i was in the hospital so after i had shortly given birth to ari and i was breastfeeding him the pains from breastfeeding and your uterus shrinking and contracting and going back to normal was so bad that i felt like i was in labor again i kept telling them like can i have an epidural for this because it was so bad i would cry i was like shaking and shivering and it's so hard because you can't really move because you're breastfeeding your baby and it happens when your baby breastfeeds like it's literally connected like as soon as you'd start breastfeeding the pains would come back on and you could feel it shrinking and it was horrible so much worse and i hear that with each baby those after labor cramps get even worse so um that's gonna be an issue i hope they start giving out an epidural for that because it was really really painful i was on like high medication because i was like yo i'm not doing this i'm not giving birth and then doing the bursting again like i was so over it it was exhausting so i dreaded breastfeeding the first couple of days and it continued like that i'd say for about five to six days but i think that's what what contributed and what helped me look not as pregnant shortly after so that was like a big change that i noticed um other than that i feel like my breasts were the same when my milk came in everything like i feel like my boobs are probably even smaller this time around my supply felt the same everything else pretty much felt the same the biggest change was like the pre after post post term cramps i don't even know what the technical term is you mambas can let me know down below but it's crazy it is crazy how god designed our bodies like as soon as we start breastfeeding you feel those cramps it's like what it's crazy so yeah that has been the biggest difference so now let me show you why you're here for the video i know y'all want to see what my tummy looks like and i actually wanted to film this video now because one of my new year's resolutions was to start working out every day i have yet to do that i've worked out like every other day i'm still not sleeping all that well i am struggling with falling asleep because ari wasn't sleeping through the night for so long and now when i go to sleep i associate that with stress and anxiety so it's been really hard for me to like calm my brain down at night i don't know if any of you can relate to that some of you said that you did in my last video but yeah so let me just show you so um i just wanted to add that i've even though my stomach felt flatter this time i noticed i have like i don't even know what they're called they like look like fat packets or like my stomach is like lumpy and i don't know what that's from it's probably just like extra fat um i don't know you'll see when i go to show you i just want to make a quick little disclaimer i realized my body could look a lot worse i realized it could look a lot better i think the whole point of this video is to normalize how you look and how you feel and make that about you and not making it about comparing yourself to other women's bodies um i actually saw this reel yesterday and it was this mom like sighing at the fact that some moms and women go back to their original weight and she's like ugh like that's so annoying and i was like well i don't know that didn't like sit well with me because i feel like the whole point is to just empower women like okay so what she went back to her original rate that's great okay she didn't go back to her original weight but she didn't want to that's great too like i feel like we really need to stop making women put other women down like why can't we all lift each other up why can't we all do good at the same time like after becoming a mom i realized that moms are really catty and just like worse than teenagers like just like mean moms are really mean and the last thing you need to be doing is comparing yourself to someone else's body so i just wanted to make this video and show you guys what my body looks like because i feel like people are like oh my gosh influencers like they bounce back so fast and i'm over here like not this one but just to normalize and make you feel like your body is welcome also i don't even know if i shaved my happy trail yes i have a happy chill but i don't think i shaved it so if you see a hair or two ignore that okay so i'm gonna put these back on so you can actually see what i look like with my pants on so um this has been probably the most um annoying thing is just that there is just a lot of extraness i do have quite a few rolls and i feel like that happens all the time one thing i'm working on is my pasture because i still walk like i'm pregnant which is kind of like when you when you kind of like do this you know i still walk and like feel like my body is pregnant so i'm constantly like slouching down um and because of breastfeeding and like you're always like this so i need to correct my posture and i feel like if i do that and get better with that my core will kind of back but side note so um this is kind of what it looks like with my pants on i'm not gonna flex anything these are not my abs i promise i don't know why it looks like it but okay okay and now this is what things are looking like so as you can see things are quite jiggly not nearly as tight my belly button looks completely different i had one of those cute like more pushed up belly buttons it's more like saggy now and i have quite a lot of extra skin right here from the side now this is the part to me that is the most annoying is that it's just right here and i know that with like exercising and eating healthy and stuff that will probably and most likely go away um but as you can see can you see that from the side you see that right there that's my mom pouch um and then my mom rolls back here let's see i'm gonna i'm gonna put you guys down just a little bit so you can probably see my stretch marks a little bit better okay so like i said ignore okay okay this is what i wanted to show you can you see this i feel like there's just like extra like little pockets and just like extra mist that like wasn't once there before um and then for my stretch marks they are honestly pretty faded it did not look like this i'll insert a picture of what it looked like a couple of days after labor um but i did do micro needling at home just a couple of um i did like two sessions but then i've stopped doing it but um i think that helped i also always put breast milk on there too but i feel like with time they probably will fade away and with a tan or something but um yeah that is just like what it looks like from the side again i do think i have ab separation they haven't come back yet um i know some moms whose bodies look perfect and absolutely the exact same they once did before they were pregnant that just hasn't been the case for me um this is what it looks like if i like flex so honestly not that much better it just feels like things aren't as much and then same with the boobs the boobs used to be so perky not perky anymore um but yeah this is what it looks like but yeah i wanted to make this video now because ideally i would like to lose this baby fat i'm okay with it i'm proud of it i'm not ashamed of it but i would like to see what my body can do like i feel like that's normal too like it's normal to be okay with your body but it's also normal to want to lose it or be okay with losing the weight like why is it that anytime anyone says anything to like oh i thought you loved your body why would you want to change it well it's like okay well i want to work out you know like i want to feel good too not that i don't feel good now but i want to see what i can do i want to see if i can lose this way i want to see and work out like i once used to work out like when i work out now oh it's so hard so i'm definitely wanting to get back into a physical health for my physical health but also my mental health because when i work out my mental health is so much better so i feel like it's kind of a full course meal here it all goes together and works together so let me fix this because it might be bothering you like it's bothering me um but yeah that is what my body looks like again don't go off comparing yourself to my body um i'm just here to show you that stretch marks are normal extra fat is normal and if you want to get rid of it that's normal too if you don't that's normal too you do you okay your body is beautiful and created a literal human being like a literal human came out of you i think you win you win life right any time jordan get jordan and i get into arguments about stuff i'm like i created a human don't try okay all right hope you guys enjoyed this i love you and i will see you in my next video hey surgery yesterday       um he won't stop pressing his face against your mind in the basket in the basket we're trying to put our binkies in the basket where are you yes always yeah you're coming out you see some on the floor time to put the bean keys in my mind and the

can't see your face you have to go down a little bit more wait till he's there almost there there's alesia hi today's vlog joke and my name is here sit here so they can see your face say for today's vlog i feel for this yoga we are redecorating what they all can do our playroom i play yay     you are so silly how did you pay the ladies yeah i bring some bubba okay come here so we are re-doing the kids actively   okay so like i was saying we are going to run into their playroom today   show them how you do your pouring activity 15 minutes later and i am here oh no   every time i go to talk she wants to talk too do you want to be a youtuber yeah okay i can tell um so because alexia is getting older i'm so i'm so mom i'm so here now that she's getting older and ari is getting a little bit older the way that we currently have the play room set up i feel like isn't functional for two kids um and i feel like the activities she's gonna start doing is gonna be a little bit more advanced so i kind of wanted to re-do it and revamp it so i thought i would show you guys today and just kind of vlog today so it's not our morning routine um i am about to put a bookshelf together because i don't have a bookshelf and i'm going to put it in the spare closet where they're actually toys for you thank you baby so so figure this out i guess thank you for them you giving it to our friends um so i got a bookshelf i also got some command hooks because i love me some command hooks and i also got this at target it's a like little safety thing i've never used and done any type of baby proofing or safety things in our house i've always set up the boundary and expected her to respect it and she has for the most part but now she can open the front door in the back door and although we have an alarm system that notifies us and everything it's just i just don't want to risk it so we're going to put one at the front door one at the garage door excuse me and then the other one i'm going to put in the playground closet i'm spending a lot of time redoing that closet and getting it organized and i don't want her going in there um i used to let her go in there and play with whatever she wanted but now that i'm spending i've literally this is like day three yeah this is day three of me organizing it i was doing it on stories a couple of days ago ma'am i'm trying to talk ow and so it's taken me a couple of days first day i took everything out and hurry and put piles of donations piles so okay anyway let's get to some buildings   took a little break because ari just woke up the schedule we have the kids on right now has been so nice because they by the time are we wakes up from his first nap she has 30 minutes until she goes down for her nap and so they can eat lunch together so we've been eating lunch so yeah we've all been eating lunch together and it's been so nice and um yesterday on instagram i actually posted about our meal scheduling and how we only spend anywhere between 100 to 150 um every week on groceries and so many of you were like what how is it that so little and i really didn't actually think it was that little i mean we used to spend like 300 before we even had kids so yeah i've definitely gotten a hang of that so i'm gonna do a video on that um within the next couple of weeks i have other videos that i've already filmed that i'll be uploading before that one but be on the lookout for that um but are you guys hungry yeah yeah i'm gonna go eat something we're gonna leave it in here okay because it's for when we nap hmm well i would did you sleep so well       gentle gentle you're safe she just really loves you okay okay i'm currently warming up our lunch so yesterday i made dinner i made rice and then i sauteed some onions zucchini and mushrooms together and then i did some ground turkey too so that's what we're gonna have right now ferrari i will give them some of like the rice and if there's like bigger pieces of the veggies yes maybe i'm getting your dinner lunch right now if there's like larger pieces of the veggies and stuff i'll give that to ari as well but alefia will eat all of this she loves rice it's one of her favorites um so i'm gonna scoop this out but the schedule has worked so well because they are able to like spend a little bit of time together before they uh alicia goes down for her nap   and i apologize if you hear some noise we're having some shelves but oh no no samson my mother has just arrived yeah did you see this scarf like this   huh 40 grams     all right my mama just went and put uh sorry i thought i saw you outside my mom i just got here she comes on tuesdays and thursdays um and because she lives about an hour away she'll normally stay from like noon until like night time so she doesn't you know like to like make it worth her while um and she just put lithia down for her nap and then ari is going down for his nap too so alexia normally goes down around like 12-ish and then ari's nap is at one and then there's ahri's second nap overlaps with alathia snap so now is like the quiet time so now is going to be the time that i can actually go upstairs and finish up the playroom it's been so crazy and chaotic not having that playroom because alexia doesn't have much to play with so she's like getting into things and it's just been quite the mess but i'm going to take my care of vitamins and they are sponsoring today's video if you've been here before you know that i absolutely love them i started taking them when i was pregnant with alathia um and they are a customized vitamin so you take a five minute quiz online it's like working with a nutritionist you fill out questions and let them know more about you so i frequently retake the test just to like adjust my body um i'm not taking a prenatal anymore because i'm not breastfeeding so i've adjusted that and just like i'm always changing out if i'm taking iron or vitamin d vitamin c those are like my key ones but it comes in a really cute little dispenser like this you pull it out and then it has what you need to take for that day right here so let's see what focus so those are all the vitamins i need to take today and then it has your name on it it's all customized which i think is really cute and i've just really enjoyed taking these i feel like everyone's a new year's resolution is to take better care of themselves i don't know who wouldn't want to do that so if you're not already stepping up your vitamin game this is your q i will leave my link down below in my code if you guys want to get 50 off um i've never heard someone regret taking their vitamins like that's not a thing i feel like everyone notices a huge difference once they start taking their vitamins and start like fueling their body the way that they need to so i'll leave my link down below um if you hear noise downstairs that is because we're having some shelves installed in our basement we have like this random storage room um and we added like shelves to it so it could be a little bit more functional and not just like everything shoved in there so that's why you might like hear some noise but anyone else take forever to take vitamins i do i have to take i can't like shove them all in my mouth jordan can i can't do that i have to do one by one and it takes me a second to follow show you guys samson because he just had surgery yesterday so he had a torn muscle in his knee um and we had tried water therapy physical therapy we tried many things um and used surgery as a last resort because the recovery is really hard um so we tried that for like three months i think it was a long time and it wasn't really working he was still in a lot of pain still limping like if you've seen any of our other vlogs like he always had his leg up so he did just have his surgery and he can't walk at all because he's healing so he has to stay inside this cage um it's already started to bleed just a little bit because we didn't have him in the cage originally but then um he would just like randomly he would just randomly get up and like pretend like he could walk which is why i feel like he got really hurt in the first place i don't know if other people who have pitbulls but i feel like they do not care about pain at all like that's just one thing i've noticed with these dogs they literally you could shoot them in the head and they would like not care and just keep doing what they're doing so samson like doesn't know how to stop which is why i think it got so bad so we need him to stay caged up so he doesn't put any strain and can heal properly um and then he's gonna have to go back to therapy to like learn how to like re-walk and all of that so prayers for samson would be appreciated we've heard it's pretty common for dogs to have that specific injury especially bigger dogs so we're not too worried but yeah prayers would be appreciated   okay all right hey guys it has been about an hour we just went to swimming class with alecia and ari um my mom is downstairs with the kids she is making cupcakes with alathia and ari's drinking a bottle um hello daniel i'm gonna finish up this room because it's been three days of this already um i got these glasses on from amazon i thought they'd be cute to like accessorize an outfit but i think they might be a little bit too big for my face but they give me like end of vibes i'm here for it and i'm eating popcorn my favorite little snack ever okay this wall right here is where the white thing used to be um i have these baskets and i'm gonna hang them back up on this side i found these all at the thrift store they weren't total i probably spent less than five dollars but um these are so cute and i feel like a wall basket is so cute and will match that guy over there so i'm just gonna put this up real quick i'm trying to remember how it looked like before     he what time you can build with um no i was right i just needed like 10 minutes this is my toy under one of them hmm okay yay i know this video is getting long so i wanted to show you guys an overview of what it looks like i still have to hang a couple of decor pieces but overall i'm really happy with this layout and i feel like it'll be very functional for the kids and now for this space i was very particular about how i did it because other times that i've done it i wasn't able to keep it because it wasn't functional or practical so i made it as practical and functional for my brain and how my brain works so i can easily just like rotate her toys do activities sensory whatever so over here i have any like boxes um or stacking things that like fit well in here i have extra toys up there um puzzles right here all through here and then all the way at the top are like those bigger bulkier type items so ones that are kind of like awkward and then any pieces that go along with them i put it underneath because i can't tell you how many times i was grabbing something down and all these like blocks and pieces hit me in the head it was just very frustrating and then here are where all the toys basically are so i did it by age so like zero to six this was like when ari was a baby uh three to six and so on and i tried to like group them so like all music all kitchen all stacking all you know all sorts of things now over here is where i do all the sensory so i made a whole thing just of fillers and fillers are basically what you put the sensory inside of so just like random little things um blacks shaving cream rice whatever and then down here i actually put like whatever animal it is that i would select for that and then over here are whatever tools she would use to rescue or to scoop or to pick up or whatever so it makes it very easy for me to just grab grab grab this whole area is basically just for me so i put her trays here so anytime she does an activity it's like displayed on this so i made sure to get some larger ones so for puzzles and stuff i could put the pieces on there so she constructs it herself and then under there are extra like little bags and stuff that are reusable all along the top here and again i reuse stuff i did have to buy these bins but this i had already this we had already i just i barely i think i spent less than thirty dollars maybe a little more but um here i put anything for like slime jello just like random stuff for me to like diy here are some paper things some cards um tape scissors other things painting supplies more painting supplies and just like little things that she would use and then down here more stuff for me to create so these are water beads balloons um just like random little things more paint little things to paint um this little guy too with some markers and more paint and then back on this wall i hung up some command hooks to hang up this little guy um this is like that tunnel this is for ari this is also for ari and then this is the bookshelf and how that turned out and then over here i just have like construction paper um some like reusable mess free ones and just like other things so oh wait last thing is over here these are like extra rules for her other thing um so far very flowy and like easy to find things and i'm very excited and excited to see what she plays with you want to say bye to youtube without touching say bye youtube mom yeah goodbye to her song no say bye to youtube song so i'm next thing show them what's in your hair a kimono you put cream on your hair diaper cream in your hair   so i paint my frog in bio and through playing everyday do you want to put these on yeah come back here um i'll have my link take care of it down below and i'll try to find links to all the stuff in the playroom i did do a tour on itunes tv so i'll link that down below because i know that for sure has links but i've been wanting to do a video on like diy toys or if you want to do montessori stuff like what you think   if you've ever wondered what my day is like this is a perfect representation hey okay we're going to say bye now say bye everyone says no no mom don't call me are you looking up your nose okay bye guys what is up you guys welcome back to my channel i am going to be doing a decorate with me video i don't think i've done one of these on my channel if i haven't be it's probably been a long minute since i've done it it's been about a little over a year since we've moved into this house and i feel like i'm frequently still trying to get little pieces to make this house feel cozy and then warm and inviting and i really want this to feel like a home not so much like a house i did end up getting that sideboard i did a vlog a couple weeks ago where i mentioned it and showed you guys and i ended up finding a really good one at a local shop here in birmingham so i will have that place linked down below um it was super affordable and i was able to like pick it up and take it home right then that day the most frustrating thing about furniture is that most of the time like if you see something online on like west elm's website or like cb2 or something you like order it and then it takes over six months especially since covid i've not gotten furniture quicker than six months i decorated ari's entire room trying to get stuff like online and it was such a hassle so i was very impatient and i was like i do not want to order something and wait six months so i was so happy i was able to like go pick it up and actually fit in my mom car so i was able to bring it home i didn't have to run a truck or anything i have a couple of pieces in front of me of what i'm going to be using to decorate it so i got a black sideboard credenza buffet call it which you will um i don't even know what the official name of this thing is i intend to use it to store our dishes and like larger serving plates and while we have our island that like fits stuff on the back side um we have bar stools right in front of it and literally every time we have someone over i always have to make someone get up and move so i can get a dish from underneath and i feel bad and i feel like it's not as accessible as it should be like what we store in there should be things that we don't need and frequently use so a sideboard or what what is it called i don't know which one what is the difference between all of them i don't know every time i look it up it's like something different so let's just call it a buffet because i feel like it makes more sense so i wanted something to store our dishes but i also wanted something to style underneath my mirror so we have this giant mirror and it honestly doesn't look that giant but this thing is enormous i think it's 60 inches it is huge i will link it down below as well as everything else that i mentioned um but we needed something to put here i originally had a plant but it kind of like blocked the view from the rest of the living room so i opted for this and you would think that it would like kind of get in the way of like the hallway but honestly no it's still pretty thin and like i feel like it kind of defines the space a little bit so it ends up looking really well so i went with black our dining table slash eating table slash kitchen table like all in one table is all black our chairs are all black so i wanted to kind of stick within the all black theme i originally didn't think i want to but now that it is black i feel like it works and flows really well with each other in addition to styling the top of that guy i also did get a couple of pillows which is this giant mount that you see right here so i thought it'd be fun to bring you guys kind of along the process of how i style what goes through my mind um and i wanted to show you guys different options too so if you guys would like to help me decorate comment below which style you like i'm probably gonna style it four or five different ways um and then you guys let me know which one you like best so i do try to go to more affordable places this is my technique okay when it comes to big pieces like a couch and table and sideboard i'm okay with spending more money but when it comes to the actual decorative pieces that's where i like to save my money by going to home goods at home ikea thrift stores other places as such so most of these things i will be showing you are either from at home home goods or the thrift store so i will try to link similar pieces down below um if i can't find it but yeah i did get pillows as well to style my couches so i'll get into this probably more towards the end of the video but i have these couches we've had them since we moved in and i absolutely love them but they came with these pillows which is the same color as like the cushions um so i never actually added pillows to it i don't know why i guess i kind of wanted more of like a minimal look to them but now that we're here i feel like this room will look so much cozier and so much more inviting with some really nice pillows so i'll include these pillows in the hall too but before we get started make sure to give this video a thumbs up if you guys want more decorating videos um and if you're not already subscribed and make sure to do so down below okay okay i guess i'll start with pillows okay since they're right here um i got a blanket to either put on the sofa like draping over the edge or like layering it in the middle i don't know i feel like you can never go wrong with a um cute little blanket you know i also got two of these i liked them because they were darker and they have this really pretty texture to them so all of these are in a neutral category because i don't want anything bright and colorful i do have a very vibrant rug which i actually am switching out i wanted to wait until the rug came in to do this video but i couldn't wait i just wanted to style the sideboard with you guys and i just couldn't wait so um and by the time i'm done editing this video if my rug does come in i will make sure to include a picture at the end if not follow me on instagram because i will definitely be posting it on there but i wanted something more neutral because my new rug that's coming in does have a little bit of color to it so um i got two of these which is like a small size um i tried to get variation and again like when i'm shopping for these things something i keep in mind is like i can always return it so i would rather get more than have to not get enough and i have to go back and then it not possibly be there so great thing is that you can go home try it style if you don't like it return it if you like it then great you have it and you don't have to go back to the store i don't know if that's just how my mom brain works because for me to get out of the store with two kids it's like if i'm gonna be here i'm gonna snag what i need because i am not coming back um and then i also got one like this long ways that was cute i like this little detail in the middle and then i got two larger ones now the color is pretty similar to my actual sofa and then it has these little fringes on the side um but i thought it was cute and interesting so i got two of those and then this one i just randomly saw it at home goods that i thought was really pretty so those are the pillows that i got we'll style those in a minute coffee break i've been doing my coffee a little bit different i add a splash of honey and then a pumpkin spice on top which has nutmeg cinnamon cloves and something else but it makes it taste so yummy here are the things that oh wait one more thing i also found i found this guy at uh at home and i thought it was perfect so it's like a magazine rack but i actually have been using it and i've been putting our bibles inside of it i'm used to put our bibles on top of the coffee table but my daughter loves our bibles and loves to like try to color in them and stuff so i was like let's not do that so putting it inside of here it's a little bit more hidden she doesn't really notice that it's in there so um that's just a little random thing now all the rest of the pieces i'm going to show you is what i plan on putting on top of the sideboard so i found this really pretty glass candle holder and then it has this really pretty gold accent so the hardware on the buffet sideboard whatever is gold so i wanted one gold piece to kind of tie it in and then at home these are all that was from at home this is from at home i like name things as they come but i found this at home i don't even know what it's called um it's just like a little side piece and it has some textures to it there's like little bubbles and just like it looks plain on camera but it does have little textures to it so i thought this would look pretty right in the middle okay moving on next things that i found were at home goods so i know this is from hobby lobby sometimes it's really hard to keep track so i will link things down below because i get a little confused at where i got things because i got them at different times this i got a couple weeks ago so this was from hobby lobby but i liked it because it was stone i'm trying to use different textures different layers it actually had like a little thing in here for you to put a candle but i don't want to put a candle i just kind of like the shape of it um and then i found this and alysia was like looking at it all funny but it's this little guy with a face on it but i liked it because it was black and like very sleek kind of modern so i snagged him and then this thing i've been looking for something like this for months and then i saw it at home goods and i snagged it because i know how popular this is right now um my dad made fun of me when i came home he was like what what is that i was like it's a knot for decor um duh dad don't you know but um i love this color i thought it would look really pretty as like an accent piece on top of the black and i feel like these are really interesting i don't know just like it's a different texture it's wooden adds a little spice or something and then last thing is from the thrift store but my friend esther actually had it at her house and she gifted it to me every time i go to that girl's house she gives me something um the week before i had gone there i fell in love with this and i was like oh my gosh that was like such a good find like good for you girl and then the next week i come over she goes oh here this is free you can have it she's like such a giver so i really appreciate her heart but she gifted me this but she found out the thrift store so it does have little pinks and beds in it but i really like that it gives it some type of texture and then i found these dried up little flowers at at home and i wanted to put them in here because i wanted some type of color some type of neutralness so those are the things i snagged now let's get on to decorating i'm going to show you guys different options and then just comment down below and let me know which one you guys feel like flows and look best and then after i style the sky board then i'll come over to the couches and decorate them as well alrighty let's do this all right i brought all my pieces over here one thing i want to acknowledge or point out is that this mirror is not perfectly centered with the sideboard reason being is this mirror is super duper heavy like i mentioned before she had to go on the stud she had to go on the stretch because if she did not go on the stud my whole wall would fall down like there's no way that the drywall would have been able to hold her so for that reason as you can see there is more space on this side and then this side which is okay we can work with that we can manipulate the eye to make it seem like it's a little bit more balanced so first thing i know that will probably go in the middle is this so i'm just gonna place her here okay i'm gonna work my magic and i'll show you guys what option one ends up   me i thought i had everything all the things life could bring but now i do anything just to be together now yes it's a new situation triggered by physical vibrations so many fields in circulation and the past is history now and i believe i was made for you you were meant for me okay those were the three options comment down below and let me know which one you like best or if you have a different suggestion um i also thought about putting a lamp in here like a really pretty lamp that has like a vase as a bottom like those really big ones that are like stone looking i've yet to find one though that is in store or is like less than 300 because those tend to be really pricey so i don't want to spend that but for now i feel like this is a good option so let me know which one you like down below i also liked the idea of possibly putting coffee table books underneath this little section right here i'm not sure if you can tell but there is a pretty like six inch opening right there that i could possibly put some books inside of or some cups or anything like that so i'm afraid it might look a little too busy so i might stay away from that idea but um it is a cute idea all right now let's head over into the living room so i wanted to give you guys more information about our couches so we have two of the harmony collection couches by west elm they took about four to five months to come in but we actually ordered them when we were still living at our old house and had the delivery day scheduled for our move-in day for this house so we have the 96 inch for the length and then for the depth we went for the extra deep which is 46 inches i believe so they are very spacious very comfy couches when i sit and then my legs are completely up like nowhere near touching the ground so i really like that they're very comfortable couches the color i will have to look up um but i'll write it down and have it linked down below but i know it may seem like okay you have two kids and two dogs why on earth would you ever get that color but it has held up pretty well we've had them professionally cleaned only once and i feel like that's not that bad and we didn't really need it to get it done we just wanted to like maintain it so the material is like super super duper durable it's like a soft linen color um and i don't regret cutting this color at all i think it's very beautiful it keeps the space very light and airy now with the pillows that i want to add i really hope that it makes the space a little bit even more inviting because i think with like the way that the couch just came it looks a little modern so i definitely want to cozy it down a little bit make it more inviting and homey so let's head over there and see what we can do okay honestly i'm gonna wait for my mom to come over because my mom is really good with pillows and i'm kind of struggling with this so i think either i have too many pillows or not enough so this side i ended up doing this so like two on each side which i think looks okay and then this side looks nice and fluffy and comfy but that's because there's like a lot more pillows so i think what i'm gonna having to do is get a couple more to kind of mimic what is on this side which is fine and then i ended up taking this really pretty um blanket and just throwing it over the edge like that i don't know if it looks weird with just one if i should get another one or a different color a different pattern to put on the other side um not entirely sure and then on the floor over there is where i put the magazine rack so obviously the space is going to look entirely different once i even switch out this rug so i feel like that will be a nice little refresher and freshen up on here but um yeah that is what i am going to do for today again i'm going to try and link as much as i can down below but i do want to encourage you to go to the thrift store use anything you have around your house you'd be surprised at how different your space can look when you take something from the master bedroom or the bathroom and put in the living room or something from the kitchen and put it in your room like switching things up you're still using the same decor but just moving it from different rooms so that's a really easy way to like style and save money as well so hope you guys enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up if you want more decor videos and videos like this i love you guys and i will see my next video hey guys welcome back to my channel a couple weeks ago i shared with you guys that we spend anywhere between a hundred dollars to 150 every week for our groceries and i couldn't believe how many of you were shocked by that but so many of you said that you easily spent over 300 every week and you're a family of two or a family of three i thought i would make this video sharing with you guys my tips on how we are able to not waste food not waste money plan our meals ahead of time and make grocery shopping and meal planning a very stress-free experience so when we first got married feeding my family was like the most stressful thing for me because i didn't know what i was doing every time i went to the grocery store it was very overwhelming i didn't know what to make sometimes i make food i'd make way too much food way too little food so much food would go to waste sometimes i wouldn't get enough food like it was just like such a hassle so it has definitely been a learning curve for me and i feel like i have perfected the formula because i feel like we spent a good amount of money we always have full bellies nothing goes to waste we have our things planned out and it hasn't been stressful it's actually become very therapeutic for me and has become a huge thing that i love to do for my family and to serve my family is to feed my family so of course it's a huge blessing that i am able to buy food every week for my family um i definitely don't want to make this like i know it's a struggle for some people so it is definitely a huge blessing that i'm even able to do this keeping all of that in mind i have a list of things that i do that i think has really helped me so i'm going to list them out and then i'm going to time stamp this so this is what has worked for my family and i want to keep emphasizing that because i think it will take a little bit of time for people to figure out what works for them how many things of each thing they need to get or how many times a week they need to go or how many times a month they need to go it's definitely a learning process first thing is well let me list these out first and then we can timestamp and you guys can follow through so first is instacart i do not grocery shop in stores anymore we also always keep our fridge very clean and well organized so things are easy to see we meal plan every single week not necessarily like let me preface this the type of me and pillaging we do it's not like every sunday we sit down and cook five meals in one sitting and have everything in the fridge i more so mean that we plan what we are going to eat every single day so when i go to place my order on instacart i know exactly what to get we also buy what we like and what we need and then i know exactly how much of each size that we need to do let's start with the beginning with instacart so no way is any of this sponsored um everything has just been what i use what we like so we use instacart if you're not familiar with instagram it's a like grocery uh grocery delivery service and i do have the membership to instacart too so i'm not sure how much it is i don't know if it's 99 a year with like free deliveries or something i just it's like automatically renewed so i will say even though i do pay months i do pay yearly for this thing with me using it i have saved so much money and i'll explain why once a week normally every sunday i place an order and it can range anywhere between 15 items to 30 to 35 items so i think the amount of items that i get isn't a very large amount because i get just what i need so the reason why i think having instacart has saved me money even though i have to pay for it every year is that i don't go to the grocery store and let me tell you the way they have the grocery store laid out at least in america is they do it in a way that makes you buy more than what you need and that is so true guys because we used to spend over three hundred dollars when it was just jordan and i now we have two kids even though one's a baby like he eats just as much as alithea does so um we used to spend 300 and it was just jordan and i and like no we did not need to spend that money but we would go to the grocery store sometimes we would go when we were hungry we would grab this new thing that looked nice this looked nice this snack oh this drink oh this and we would just end up with so much more than what we needed we would spend so much more money end up eating junk food that we didn't necessarily want to be eating and then things would go bad and it would be super wasteful so because i do instacart i get and look up exactly what i need i'm not walking through an aisle i'm not browsing all these new things and good fun and fresh things so there definitely is a plus side to that i get exactly what i need and i'm not really tempted to get anything else the downside of that and to me this obviously outweighs it because i haven't gone to a grocery store um i think the last time i grocery shopped in store was when i was pregnant with a latho so it's been over two years since i've gone into a grocery store to buy groceries like it's been a minute um so the cons there's obviously a lot of pros now the cons that some people might completely turn away from this is that you're not able to get your own fresh produce now for a while this did bother me but you kind of get used to it and the convenience just it just makes it so much easier i don't have to leave my house i can order it and it's in my house in two hours like it's just it's just very convenient now if you don't have kids if you're able to go out um and it doesn't take you more than an hour to grocery shop then you might not necessarily need it but then you're gonna need the discipline not to get those yummy snacks that look really good in the corner you know so you don't get to get your own produce sometimes they won't deliver to the right address this has happened a couple of times because we are in a new build i ordered a cart one time at night and it was supposed to be delivered in the morning and it was gonna be our breakfast food for that day and then i go downstairs and there's nothing at the front door and i was like uh where's my groceries like i don't even have eggs to cook breakfast right now and someone accidentally delivered it to another house so there's little hiccups that can happen but again their customer service has been great they refunded me and sent me a new thing and i was able to get new deliveries in like two hours so there's definitely hit or misses for me obviously it works and i have a lot of more pros than i do cons so you definitely want to figure out what works best for you i just had our groceries delivered actually i'm just eating one of these muffins that i got and they were so good but i want to show you what we got i'm not going to go in depth into it because each week it depends on what we're making for dinner and all that good stuff but i wanted to show you guys how much we spent this time so um let's see okay so for this week we got 17 items and we spent 130 last week we got 38 items and we spent a lot last week um because we got diapers we got creams we got all this extra stuff the week before that we got 31 items and spent 150 the week before that we spent 46 dollars a week after that we spent 160 and then another week we spent 60 dollars and then 75 um 86 160 118 120 so they each just range it depends on what we're getting it depends if we need more things depends if we get diapers but overall i feel like it ends up being an average of 100 to 150 each week so this is the goodness we got next thing we plan our meals every single sunday um i wanted to do salmon bowls i know we just had salmon but it looks really good and i wanted to have that and beef and broccoli okay what was the thing you said you wanted um i'm gonna be making sweet and sour turkey meatballs in the crockpot okay so you want to do that tomorrow then on tuesday yes okay now i could just start in the morning let it go eight hours and then it'll be ready by dinner okay so what do you need what is that turkey you need turkey ground turkey chili sauce and jelly grape jelly that's it do you want to have that with rice so ground turkey which one do you like this one yeah it's cheaper two two pounds jelly what kind of jelly just regular concord grape jelly so we started doing date nights every sunday and one thing that i was always hesitant on doing was uh i guess like doing work stuff or like busy stuff that like i didn't find enjoyable to be doing with my husband but we recently started dreaming together and what i mean by dream is like find out goals that we have and like how we can achieve those goals and then we also started doing practical things like planning out our entire week like what is he doing for work what am i doing for work what are we doing for meals and it doesn't take long it takes anywhere between five to ten minutes for us to do this we kind of sit down plan out what we need and figure out like okay what do we want what do we need i'm at the point where we've been doing this for a while so i know exactly what we need every single week so the reason i grocery shop once a week is because i buy a lot of fresh fruit i buy a lot of fresh meat i like my things fresh i've noticed if we go bi-weekly we end up with a lot of stuff we don't have the space for a lot of stuff a lot of things go bad it doesn't get eaten up i'm really bad with freezing things i forget to freeze it it goes bad it gets wood like it's just a lot more wasteful and we end up spending more at a big chunk so i'd rather do little shops once a week stay consistent always have fresh stuff and not have to worry about it so on sundays when we plan our meals um i have a list of things that i get every single week no matter what i always get these things so eggs oat milk um berries bananas spinach like random things so one thing that i have done that has really helped is create a template so if you guys want this template i will include it in my newsletter that i just launched it's called me time it goes out every single monday so if you guys would like to receive this make sure to go to the link down below i'll include it for you guys and just subscribe to the newsletter once you subscribe make sure to go to your email and confirm your subscription and then i will include it in the following mondays newsletter so um it's just a template that has everything that we use every week so in my mind i don't forget and then it also includes things that we normally get every other trip to the grocery store or monthly um the reason why i say that it ranges between 100 to 150 is because of diapers or wipes or creams or toilet paper it's not something that we get every single week but when we do it does add a larger amount because i think a thing of diapers is like 30 so if i get stuff for the kids like that drastically increases how much we spend on our groceries so i do have our wipes delivered every single uh every other month from amazon which has saved us a lot of money and has made it less hassly i don't have to worry about wipes i haven't done that for diapers yet because i feel like it's inconsistent still and we're potty training so it's like it's kind of a little place i haven't figured it out yet but um if you have noticed by now we don't do costco and when i do instacart i get it through kroger so the reason we don't do costco or any of those bulkier things is because i don't feel like we're large enough to be doing that we have done a couple of grocery stops and that and stuff and it's nice for like toilet paper paper towel like those a lot larger things um detergents and whatnot but for food for us it doesn't make sense it's a waste of money we waste food we don't eat all of it so it just makes more sense and it's a lot cheaper for us to just stick to kroger admire whatever we end up doing so um we don't shop at whole paycheck aka whole foods their stuff is so expensive and kroger has really good stuff they have all the organic things too so i do buy organic basically everything when we plan out our meals we pick three meals so i will cook three times a week sometimes four the reason we make three meals is because i would rather cook more things and have leftovers to make lunch the next day than to cook every single day and then it's just it's a lot more hassle-y so for us we have found that three meals has worked great so i get to cook three times but then i get a lot of meals out of that so normally we'll do monday wednesday tuesday okay it kind of ranges so normally we'll do like monday tuesday monday tuesday wednesday cooking or sometimes monday wednesday thursday cooking it just kind of depends on what we have the most leftovers for so we'll make enough leftovers to have lunch the next day and then possibly have dinner again so i like to make sure that one of those meals is a crock pot meal so crock pot meals are the best because you do it in the morning you put it there and you forget about it until it's time to eat dinner and you barely did anything so i would suggest making a crock-pot meal on whatever day is the busiest for you guys so for us tuesday tends to be a busy day because the kids have swim class and we have other things going on like bible study and whatnot so it's easier for us to do a crock pot meal on that day because then we are guaranteed to have a nice yummy meal but then i don't have to spend extra time because i won't be home or whatever if you need to do crock pot meals every day then do it like they're so good in so many good recipes so normally one is a crock pot the other two are things that i make normally the meals that i make are very simple i'm not doing a souffle i'm not doing a five course meal like i uh no i tried to do like something simple like a rice lentils or potatoes something and then a vegetable and then a meat so i have really gotten the hang of making these more simple meals that take anywhere routine 15 to 30 minutes so i'm not spending hours in the kitchen like i enjoy the kitchen but again i'm not going to be there for an hour i don't have that time i'd rather be with my kids so i kind of just pick and choose the stuff that i do you know i make it therapeutic enough where i'm like oh this is fun but then i'm over it and i'm like ready to eat it and i'm not going to be there for an hour so being very selective of your meals so during the night we will plan those meals so like you guys saw in that video we planned to do beef and broccoli um sweet and sour meatballs and salmon bowls so most of my recipes i get from pinterest pinterest is a free place where you can find literally everything that you would ever need i love pinterest so much guys it is a great resource i normally will look up let's say i want to have salmon i'll literally just look up salmon recipes and i'll just scroll for a little bit and find it then i will save it i have a yummy highlight you guys can follow me on pinterest and you can shop and see what my yummy um category has but it's basically where i just save all my favorite recipes i do frequently like to remake things i'd say i have a good 10 to 15 recipes that we frequently switch out and like try or do that are different i'm not trying extravagant things for example the salmon bowl that we're making it's just salmon rice and edaname jordan always makes fun of me because i always say wrong but those like little green little ball things that look like peas so easy to make so delicious both the kids love it and it's just a fan favorite in the household always go on pinterest um sometimes just by head i'll just think of something at brazilian so rice and beans and literally anything else is always a go-to any type of veggies i'll just put them all together like just i feel like the more you get comfortable in the kitchen the more hungry you get and the more like taste for food you get and you just get more comfortable with that is great as well we also have used home chef for two-ish years now and i have tons of recipe cards and home chef is very easy and convenient so i will take some of my recipe cards and remake those meals and just portion out and buy what i need to buy according to what it instructs so i've had it before i've made it before it's easy and simple to follow um jordan did buy us a cookbook it's called cook once eat all week i haven't actually tried it out yet but i know there are tons of recipe books tons of resources out there so definitely do your digging in your research and see what it is that you like what your family likes um and stick with that before moving on to my next point i want to mention that my kids eat what we make for dinner i don't make separate meals for my kids and i think this is a huge reason why i save a lot of money is because i just buy so much less and i'm not buying to like two separate meals if that makes sense so um the biggest way we've gotten our kids to eat what we eat is from the very start we gave them whatever we were eating kids babies especially want to eat and will eat to survive they are not picky there's no way they can be picky because they haven't tried everything that there is to eat yet so exposing them and having them try all these new things developing that palette at an early age i think is so key and we did baby lead meeting and i think that's a huge reason why they were able to try so many things because they were feeding themselves and whatever that saves us a lot of money because i don't have to cook two separate meals i don't have to buy two separate things we don't do the chicken nuggets french fries that just doesn't work for our family if it works for us that's great but i think for us that's how we've stayed a lot on cost once my groceries get delivered i like to do a whole whole system here so one thing is cleaning out the fridge and keeping it organized i think for me at least as a visual person this really helps me not waste food see everything that i have not buy extra of things um and it makes sure that we eat everything that we have before even placing any orders so um i like to go through the fridge and keep it organized keep my meats in all one section keep my eggs and the kids things all in certain areas so for snacks at least and this kind of keeping on topic with the kids um we used to buy apple juice and juices a lot and those can add up and get pricier i mean i think it's like three three or four dollars five dollars whatever for a juice apple juice orange juice whatever and i found that we were spending a lot of money buying those and my daughter stopped drinking water and only wanted apple juice which you know i don't really think is great for her so i stopped buying juices and we just buy well we don't buy water we have water so that's what she gets um we save money on doing that and she's healthier she's drinking a lot more water she loves water and doesn't really ask for apple juice anymore same with snacks so snacks she loves her snacks but i tried to really limit that and keep it to healthier options every once in a while we'll get like a thing of goldfish or cheez-its or whatever but for the most part we stick to like little um fruits cheeses um she loves rice cakes she loves like little peanut butter jelly sandwiches um carrots like little carrots we tried to like give her different alternatives because i don't watch her just munching on goldfish all day now yes we will get it like once a month like jordan just bought a big thing so however long that lasts us we'll keep it for but then we probably won't buy that for another month or two so that's another way that we save on costs too so buying berries and blueberries and bananas like we make her eat those because that's what we already have um and then we save on cost for little snacks and stuff like that so with keeping everything clean i do a huge clean out and throw sweeping of what's in there um i try not to let a week go by before i like i try not to let we go by without cleaning it so that way i know exactly what leftovers are left that we need to eat up i know what has gone bad or i know what sauces i need to get next week or just like just keep a good inventory so again that template that i made will have like kind of an inventory section um i catered it to how we do it so it will be a template where you can like customize and add to your own things but to me it makes more the most sense to like list out everything that i need in one week and then what i need for the pantry that every so often um sauces that we need every so often so that's just how my brain works so you can customize the template to how you want but it's going to initially have what we do so try it out and see if it works for you guys too okay and now last thing is sizing and portions so this i think will be crucial to each person that is doing this it took us a while to figure out like if i'm making a recipe with ground beef how much ground beef do i need to buy to last us that dinner and lunch the next day and possibly the next day this i think will depend on how much each person eats how many people you have in your family how many meals you want it to last so i have found that for us one pack of ground beef will last us for that dinner and then also two servings of leftover the next day sometimes if i do two we'll have enough for dinner leftovers and another dinner it just depends on how much each person eats but like if it's a really good recipe and we love it and everyone gets second servings like olathe gets two servings i get sushi majority like we won't have leftovers and we won't have dinner so and that i know which recipes they like more so i will get more of something or if i know it's going to be nice to have broccoli like ari loves broccoli so anytime i do make broccoli i make sure to add a couple more so i can have them on hand for ari when he's hungry or whatever so it's definitely a learning curve and i hope that this video just kind of helps you figure out what to look for and like how to plan for things so i think it's better to have too much than too little because then you can have leftovers some people don't even like leftovers but for me in the middle of the day i am not gonna get my pots and pans out and start cooking a meal in the middle of the day to clean up like because every time you cook you have to clean and then you have to like use this it's just like a whole ordeal so for me it just makes more sense to do it three times a week cleaning is less the mess is less the time is less and with crock pots too i make it first thing in the morning when we are making our breakfast so we normally do have a warm breakfast every day um we're not too big on cereals after we switch to oat milk oat milk does not taste good with cereal it just doesn't normal milk is just so much better with it so i'd rather just not eat it because it doesn't taste as good so i will make sure to do my crock pot meal when i'm making breakfast so like if i need to cut out

on your plate   ready one two three oh clean you are just pretty good hey guys welcome back to my channel i am going to bring you guys along my kids day showing you guys their schedule and their routine and they are both under the age of two so lazy is actually going to turn to this month in a couple of weeks and ari is seven and a half months old almost eight months old or maybe he's eight months old i can't remember they're 16 months apart and the first couple of months of our life after having art were very hectic because they were on such different schedules and the second one would wake up the other one would go to sleep and then like it was always like i never had a moment or a break and it was really hard to figure out how to like live life and i was like dude i can't do this if this is what it's going to be like for the rest of my time hello he's right there um but after i returned about six months he started to get more routine more scheduled started sleeping through the night i'm gonna share exact details of like what time they go to sleep in case you guys have babies that are two and under the age of two um and it's worked really well i love the schedule that they're on right now it's been great with their food their naps that one of their naps actually overlay and it's just been fabulous so i'm going to walk you guys through that all today we're upstairs now both the kids just ate i just changed both of them or jordan's changing all right later i just changed ari um i keep them in their pjs i don't change them first thing in the morning into like regular clothes because they get so messy at breakfast that in my mind it doesn't make sense to dirty two things it just makes more sense to just leave them in their pjs get that dirty and then change them on their clothes for the day   see animals wait what do you see he wasn't going to see the emerald glass okay come here this baby all right it's 9 28 ari has to go down for his nap in two minutes i'm gonna let him play just a little bit stretch his little body um alicia's gonna play for a little bit normally in the morning i'll set up like a sensory activity read some books or go on a walk or something try to keep her occupied before she goes down for her now   what is that   into he wants to vlog again my mind what a five six seven goldberg bagel home and ollie first payroll play room yeah jordan went to grab ari his bottle he prepped his room for his nap so it's completely dark in there blender clothes lights are off sound machine is on um jordan is going to give him a bottle in that room with it all dark and everything and then we put on this like sleep sack it's more so like just like a blanket because babies can't sleep with blankets so this goes like over their shoulders like did you see the lady just having it um but it just goes over their shoulders and just likes keeps him like nice and warm and snug so his diapers gonna get changed um he's gonna get burped and then jordan is gonna lay him belly down in the crib with binkies around him so ari is a trooper and he's been napping so well it wasn't like that for a while until he like got him on a schedule but now he does great so he'll be out for about two hours yes um yeah tell me i'm looking at you what do you see ammo animals look at humbles awesome uh   and some wine thing oh   where's your tray we're gonna get some snacks oops i'm gonna get it right now we're gonna play with droppers can you say droppers oh this is my sweet not to eat it i know it looks like food but it's not for eating okay here's what we're gonna do we're gonna use the dropper to pick up this water from the red watch let me show you we're gonna put it in here so it goes like this excuse me i'm going to show you how to do it the dropper goes like this look you're going to put it in you're going to squeeze it and let go and the water comes up look i'm going to put it in there okay so put put it in the water put in the water and squeeze it yep yeah now put it in here squeeze it good there you did it now put it in here just squeeze wow oh my gosh i can't believe we can do that whoa red let me get a blue one i'm gonna do a blue one too let's do it leave it what color is that pink blue make your red a little more red oh all right so now we go like this and we're gonna mix the blue and the pink and the red no nope nope the point of the activity is to use the dropper there let's make more that's we got our blue and red dropper we're using our dropper ma'am ma'am ma'am we're using our dropper yeah i i see you're frustrated if you would like to doing a pouring activity we can do one you want to do a pouring activity instead yeah okay i'll get your pouring and scoops now you try pouring that one in there see what happens what color does it turn whoa whoa what color is that purple oh look at that     it is 11 30. it's been two hours since ari went down for his nap so we're gonna go wake him up do you want to wake him up no no okay hello good morning it's ari hi my best friend joey is here she's gonna hang out with the kiddos before she goes to work let's smell your poopy diaper if you have one thank you but oh it's all sinking you're still thinking i'm eating his fruit hey i'm gonna give you your own don't take aries   watermelon   yeah they are private and name is very much though hi say goodbye i love you physical touch i love you yeah thank you for having us all right it is a little bit after 12. miss elite goes down at 12 but because we had our friends over for lunch she's going down a little bit later she does still drink a bottle of oat milk and she still uses her binkies during her nap time so oh i'm tired from going up the stairs i already changed her diaper so i'm just going to put her in here just like ari we have blackout curtains so these are actually roman shades but on the back they have like this really dark film i don't know if you'll be able to see it um right here there's like this film i don't know if you can see it it's like this thick material that helps keep them black even though they're white and then we'll turn on your sound machine we have it the hatch baby sound machine and then this is the sound that we use so i just turn it up and turn down the brightness so there's no light shining i love you what i love you bye baby   it's time for um's nap i'm gonna change his clothes because he has avocado all over i'll never hear you and you're ready he's gonna have his back     how old are you one you're gonna be two is   it's too much i cannot handle it i can't it's too much i can't there we go i'm going to tie it but try again again try it again all right mr ari is supposed to nap for two hours but it's actually been two hours and 45 minutes so we're gonna wake him up chunky boy are you good baby   yes i know for the bible these are statues he's not even listening   so good i've noticed with ari the more he sleeps at night the more he sleeps during the day so um i don't know i feel like recently i don't know if it's because he's teething or what but probably but he has been napping a lot longer um and if we let him sleep he'll sleep for a while so i only woke him up because if it gets too close to his bedtime he won't wake up so right now it's four o'clock and their bedtime is normally around 7 30 8 o'clock they're basically on an eight to eight schedule um i'd rather them stay up a little bit later and wake up a little bit later then go to bed early and wake up early if that makes sense so um yeah are you hungry you want some pears so he's just gonna eat a little snack right now alysia when she woke up from her nap had her snack because they both had lunch at like 11 30. so snack for the both of them and then we won't eat dinner until about six sometimes 5 30 it depends um and i would say that this part of the day is probably the hardest because they're starting to get tired they're starting to get hungry we've had the whole day already i'm starting to get tired like i find that this part of the day i have to get a little creative that's normally when they'll watch some shows or tv while i'm making dinner and yada yada yeah we'll try to go out run some errands with them and stuff so he's gonna chow on this and then we'll check back in with you guys   jordan made dinner he made some meatballs in the crock pot and some rice it's sweet and sour meatballs rice what do you have foods lollipop lollipop someone looks like they're pooping over there oh no oh that's so ollie you want to show our your lollipops oh your coat wasn't hung up listen oh yeah lollipop don't want to try it you can't have it bye-bye   fresh flavor it's a good point personally honey no thank you uh mine would you like something   okay right now you put them on mine okay it is the end of the day it's almost eight o'clock it's 7 53 kids are showered had their bath they're playing a little bit they have their bottles and they're gonna go down to bed aries same thing as earlier goes in the sleep sack has this bottle burps has these binkies same with alathia um and they'll sleep through the night and we'll see them tomorrow anywhere between seven to eight eight thirty it depends i feel like they range pretty drastically it basically just depends on what time they go to bed so she's starting to get a little loopy are you loopy tooky yeah you are but i hope you guys enjoyed this video i'm really tired right now and my hair is so greasy i'm going to go wash my hair do some oplex in it because it is looking rough but i hope you guys enjoyed and i'll see you guys in my next video look you did look at it   exciting day because i launched my presets can anyone else's husband not walk past them without smacking their butts i think this is cute   the second drawer um the closet hey guys good afternoon welcome back to my channel this is actually my second time recording this and i'm a little sour about it because i spent all day yesterday vlogging i was so excited about the footage i got like the sweetest moments with the kids and then i went to edit it today and the audio was so foggy and like there was no way i would be able to fix it normally you can go in adobe and like fix a couple of things you can like de-noise and de-hum and like they have sorts of things but no it was like static like straight like so so that was kind of a bummer but i'm gonna be vlogging it today um yesterday was a super exciting day because i launched my presets and you guys have already had a chance to try them out and you guys have been using them and tagging me in your photos and it's been so exciting so if you follow me on instagram you know i kind of have like a rustic more like moody warm tone feed i always promised to you guys i wouldn't like pose my instagram and i would say that to a certain extent like i think a lot of people do really go out of their way to take pictures um and i always want to capture real in the moment things so the best way to make my photos look really nice and flow together is to use a preset so i'm gonna have my link down below so um both the kids are napping today my mom is here it seems like every time i vlog my mom is here but because she comes on tuesdays and i tend to always vlog on tuesdays but i'm still in my pjs um i actually got this from target and it's honestly very cute but i wanted to do a little try on haul because i got a couple of things from thredup um and they are sponsoring this portion of today's video i actually got quite a lot of stuff me just casually seeing if i have armpit here or not um but i order stuff from there pretty frequently before i do any type of shopping i always like to see if threadup has anything on their website so if you guys aren't familiar they are an online thrift store the largest and it's so easy and so convenient because you type in what you want find a brand like if you want something from madewell just type in madewell and all the options come up and you don't have to move from your couch like it is fabulous because when i go to the thrift store i just spend so much time just like sifting through the aisles and i'll be there for like 45 minutes to an hour and it's just like it's a little tiring so i'm gonna show you guys a couple of things that i got before i get dressed for the day all right first thing i got was this windbreaker it's by a company called ashley it was originally 25. and i got it for 12.99 and i think it's so cute it has a pop of color not normally what i do but i think this would be so cute with like leggings let me take a step back so cute wait i really love how that looks with leggings i feel like this would be so cute with like some dad sneakers you know i'm here for it all right next thing is a graphic tee i actually found so many cute graphic tees you guys know i'm obsessed with these i feel like they're so easy to style with anything jeans leather pants leggings like anything so this one let me find my phone this one is from a company called show me your mom and it was originally 70 bucks and i got it for 24. cute next one is this shirt i wore it in my last vlog i think um i've worn it at least five times in the past two weeks like ever since i got it i've been wearing it all the time and i always get questions about it um but isn't this just like such a like it just gives me my mom vibes when she was my age is by h m is originally twenty four dollars and i got it for twelve dollars um oh and i also got a really cute hat too i think this is cute i don't know if i'd wear it with this outfit but i love their accessories i always get shoes and hats and stuff from thredup as well last thing is what i'm actually going to wear for today so i have this really cute oversized like pullover it's from madewell it's originally 150 bucks and i got it for 50. so basically a hundred dollars off but i love that you can shop through different brands because madewell is one of my favorites because they're clearly made very well so i'm going to leave my link down below if you guys want to try thredup you can get 30 off the code molena um yeah i feel like this is this is this is a cute little look all right i'm gonna put some socks on the kids have swim class today so normally other days they have swim class i don't really do my makeup all that much and i don't really like get too dressed up because i'm gonna have to get undressed and put on a swimsuit and then once i get out like i don't want to be cold so i always wear like sweatpants or something but it's been freezing in michigan like absolutely freezing it's like negative in the negatives it's gonna be like negative seven and then it's just like not been good weather it's so cold yeah it's gonna be like negative four on sunday so um the only thing about try ons is that i normally end up with a little pile here of clothing so i'm just going to put this away real quick but this was the set i was wearing earlier that was super cute i don't know if they're pjs or not they were like in that in between section of target where they have their pjs but they also have their activewear so it doesn't have padding or anything it is very comfortable like a cottony type of material so i don't think it's athletic and miss miss alifia is chatting up a storm over there i am ready for my afternoon coffee i already had my lunch um so that means i can have my coffee now wow very nice outfit thanks very sassy can anyone else's husband not walk past them without smacking their butts nope bloody all right i'm gonna make um a coffee for my mother and i mother oh i met a girl at church this past week and she said that she calls her mom mom i know oh that's so sweet um okay so i'm gonna make a longo so i'm gonna do it in an espresso now i bought these pods they're like off brand of nespresso i got them at kroger so i honestly didn't even know you could buy like off-brand espresso pads because nespresso pads are pretty expensive so i was happy when i saw these but there's not like no label on them at all so i'm gonna make this i do a longa which is a little bit more than an espresso shot and then to sweeten it i use honey which honestly tastes really good and then i add this pumpkin pie spice and then mix it with oat milk why isn't it going   what you want a little bit of honey yes   like this like yeah you can always add more okay all right i warmed up oat milk in the microwave because even though this comes with a frother it actually doesn't froth oat milk for some reason it always comes out like watery and like lumpy and it doesn't taste very good so i just warm up some oatmeal on my own is that good darker lighter and then i splash this on up we can hear lathey and she's always thinking i had a dream from rapunzel and earlier she was going eugene my mother sometimes she'll come up to me and she'll go i'm the lost yeah she will say that and she'll go i gotta tell mother because that's what she says in the movie dude is this video why isn't this working anymore just looking at your friends his leg is doing it so much better i'll show you guys now because like last time it was a little graphic now it's not graphic it like looks totally fine are you doing good bob he's out of the cage he can walk like normal same little derp derpy dirt he's like the sweetest little ears what do you see wait a lot of people already got it i know i know it's crazy i asked people to let me edit their photos in two minutes i had literally over a thousand pictures wow oh so the people sing to you yeah i asked people to send it so i could edit so people can see what it looks like on different skins before they buy yeah how it like i like their hair so that's why we were posting in your story yesterday yeah did you see like other people yeah i thought people was already no no i there no there were some that i posted but then i took down the slide because it was my phone was like getting hot it was like so many pictures wow yeah but it's a lot overload yeah um so this is the nutella preset it's like super warm i feel like the name nutella is like the perfect way to describe it it is um i think nutella and ari are the ones i use the most you like ari art is my favorite because it's really like bright i was actually gonna edit a picture but it is a cute bright i love the picture all right i'm gonna finish up a couple of things that i have to edit um and do for work stuff and then we're gonna take the kids to swimming classes   no more candy the pig on the bed and all my marks slapping on a bed one fell off mom i added close to her thing i kind of want to spray paint these you do i feel like there's nothing purple in her room wait for me i think it's more like a neutral okay i think it would look cute to do like a wicker hi baby good morning good morning good morning   oh   um yes hold on all right we're getting the kids ready for swim class i think yeah see if that still fits him the blue one right so blue blue no the other one too yeah all right you want to pick your swimsuit i don't think this fits her anymore oh he's blowing that this is my swimsuit it's a blue one this one i found at target for her she hasn't been able to wear it but i i don't know what it is about swimsuits i don't know if they shrink really fast but this one like got so small so now i think she'll be able to fit in this ones and we have these reusable swim diapers that we use and then ari has a speedo where is your speedo   look at that look at it oh here she goes i'll say it here she goes say i'm vlogging my mind excuse me excuse me as soon as my friend and mother sway me and then me what day is today i'm i'm

dada will ask for you when it's time okay the dogs already ate today they're going to eat in the evening   dudes i appreciate your help it's not time for them to eat yet sorry lyla lilah false alarm sorry sorry false alarm here call me sorry false alarm false alarm she's no time space concept of timing   shoes oh i need to get my clothes do you have your clothes what do you mean i need this top all right ladies   i need to go grab them okay yeah she just needs chips yeah all right alecia had a snack ari's having a bottle right now i wanted to show you guys what we bring to slim class so we go in our swimsuit so when we get there we can just take it off and we don't have to deal with like getting changed as soon as we get there so we bring four towels one for the each of us and then the diapers i also bring a cream because our skin gets so dehydrated we don't rinse off i think they rinse off because they have like a little section but because of covid i think they closed it um so normally we would rinse off and then put on some lotion and stuff but i can't do that anymore and then i have our masks we don't wear masks inside of the pool though um because we're socially distanced and you're not supposed to wear a mask inside of a pool because if you get like super wet it's like a huge choking hazard to like get the water stuck in your face and stuff it's the cdc's website so um that's what we have already has his bottle i want to show you guys his teeth because he just got two teeth on the bottom um alicia didn't get her teeth until she was one we were actually on our way back from florida from celebrating her birthday and she got teeth pretty late normally kids get teeth in between like six months to a year so ari is going to be eight months old in a couple of weeks and he got his two bottom teeth so i'll show you guys that once he's done finishing his bottle but um yeah i kind of want to stop and get food on our way back because i kind of want to snack i had an early lunch and i'm kind of let me hungry the car on because it is really cold and i don't want to dust off my car because there's snow all up on it so i hope it melts um yeah and i'm still using my fawn bag it's just my favorite diaper bag ever and i actually i have the brown and the black i actually really really really love the black i don't know if it's because of my style change or what but the black just looks good with so many outfits um i feel like it just kind of blends in more so i don't think my code works with them anymore because that contract expired but um hopefully i'll be working with them pretty soon and i can get another code for you guys but let's go to swimming class all right we are back from swing class i'm gonna get started on dinner it's almost five o'clock um mr ari is making his belly he loves swimming class so much i didn't start lazy in swimming class until she was almost one or maybe she had just turned one somewhere around that time um but we started ari when he was six months old and he loves it he kicks around and the timing works out perfectly because it's like during their wait times um but he's getting nice and beefy and strong um he got a new tooth i was trying to i was talking about it earlier but i didn't get a chance to show you so let's see you know how hard it is to get a baby to show their teeth because they stick their tongue out when you try to do it so let's see ah okay i don't think i'm gonna get it but i'll post a picture um so you guys can see but i'm gonna get started on dinner we're gonna do a home shop today it is a get creamy truffle steak penne and it sounds so good and it only takes 15 minutes to make i'm assuming the pasta is already cooked so they're not sponsoring today's video but we do eat them pretty frequently so it's bound that their stuff is incorporated in my videos so you want to feed yourself this we'll finish um my mom and alexia are in the garage he is playing with like the workout stuff um jordan is about to work out with his friends they always work out at like 5 5 15 every day and that's normally when i'm with the kids and making sure so um let me get started on that i actually have some meat that i'm gonna just throw into this even though it's not supposed to be in it just so i can use up some of my meat before it goes bad um and yeah i'm like starting dinner early but that's because i'm hungry oh he's so yummy all right my hack for cooking before you start cooking is to clean up your kitchen so when you start cooking you don't have the mess of like the food you're about to make the mess of food from earlier today so for example like we clean our dishes as the day goes by but normally the dish rack gets pretty tall so i'm gonna put this stuff away so that after dinner all i have to do is clean what i already made that makes sense at the end of the day two is normally when alicia gets to watch a show so she'll normally just pick a movie to watch um and then ari normally will either hang out with her watch the show hang out with me i did make jello i don't know i didn't really talk about it but i made some jello for ari to play with for sensory um the only thing though is that jello is really messy so i might just do it in the bath before they take a bath um but we'll see right now he's just crawling around on the ground he just loves to explore i really love the apes that already that right now for that reason you're able to just kind of let them chill and let them do their own thing they're not like super needy um which is nice because it's good it's good for sorry i don't need to keep going out of the screen i should probably back this up but it's good for them developmentally to be able to explore and do all that on their own and it's good for me because then i get a little break is this movie you want to watch   can ari watch it with you yeah yeah you want to go watch it on the couch or you want to sit here and watch what is that what's the evil guy's name jafar no that's a lion that's aladdin what's his uncle's name the mean one oh no not jakarta looks like king what's the bad guy's name that guy bad guy yeah what's his name do you remember no we're not gonna eat the remote we're gonna get the camera mom i think i may have too much like water in my with my hand on it yeah so should i take it out you can take it out or um   you're watching watching something this looks so so good okay it's 5 30 and dinner is ready to be served alithea is finishing up with her movie lion king ari's been all around my mom's snuggling with dukes too but that is going to be all for today's video i hope you guys enjoyed um i will leave my thread up link down below in my code is melania if you guys want to get 30 off um i'll also link like any other random stuff that i showed um throughout the day as well but i love you guys and i'll see you next week sundays are get ish done days at our house   i love to prep on the weekends i love to get things in order during the weekend so that during the week i can just focus on being with my kids and doing my work and not really have to worry about too many like household chores and things so um this is kind of like the routine that we do normally on saturdays and sundays sometimes on one day sometimes we split them in between so i thought it'd be a fun little idea to show you guys exactly what i do to kind of help prepare myself for the week so today's actually sunday yesterday i did do like more of like a deep clean around the house put things back in order but it's the next day and things are already messed up and all nasty normally i like to put away any laundry get all that settled i like to take care of anything in the kitchen that is out of place needs to be put back into place um i reorganize all the kids toys so they have a bin down here and they have their playroom so down here i'll reorganize their toys upstairs i like to rotate their toys is that four or five i can't remember i like to rotate the kids toys um i like to just put random stuff that like throughout the week has been out of place so like overall i feel like our house stays pretty well organized because everything has its own place but i find that during the week we get impatient out of like we're just lazy and just kind of like put it wherever we can find space for it so during the weekend i like to go and like actually put things where they belong so like right now i feel like our pantry is a hot mess um there's like some random stuff over there that's out of place the kids toys are out of place so yeah today today is just gonna be a nice little cleaning video um i did severely sunburn my lips which yes you can sunburn your lips um i've done it so many times and i have not yet learned my lesson i always forget to put sunscreen on my lips um they severely blistered and they're just now starting to look okay and honestly i did not want to film those like people are gonna think this is gross i mean it is kind of gross but whatever this is real life i have blisters on my lips get over it um so i'm drinking my coffee jordan actually got this from yesterday but i didn't drink it because you know you're not a mom if you finish your coffee i'm gonna start upstairs so this is my biggest tip start by level so if you have multiple levels start at one level before you head down to the other one and as you're on one of those levels if there's something from the top level that needs to go down create a little pile by the stairs of what needs to go down so you're not having to like do too much traveling so um both my kids are napping ari actually did wake up and i heard him fussing around a little bit but something we do is we actually leave him in there until he's not fussing anymore so he gets used to just having quiet time and like being alone i think that's why alethia is so good at being independent is that she um she just knows that we like won't go in there instantly so he's just playing in there so i'm gonna leave him in there for a little bit longer at least until i can do this area alecia's napping and jordan is also napping so jordan does help me a lot jordan actually did all the dishes this morning and stuff so he's resting he didn't sleep that well last night so i'm in the kids playroom this is where i'm gonna start their playroom is actually pretty clean right now um i just need to rotate their toys i found that the easiest way to keep my kids entertained is to have activities planned and i know it sounds like such a daunting task and it can be if it's unplanned if you plan it ahead of time if you spend like 5-10 minutes on sunday kind of just do a little rough rough rough lincoln of activities you want to do come the week you have them planning you just throw them out and do it and your kid is fine so um i'm going to rotate their toys i haven't rotated their toys in two weeks or three weeks it's been a minute so i'm going to rotate those out and plan some sensor activities so i will normally just spend a minute on instagram or pinterest whatever and find some things i've recently really struggled with activities for alathia because i feel like she's such an age right now where like i am planning things that are not enough there are i feel like i'm planning things for her that aren't advanced enough um so i've been having to look at montessori things for a three-year-old instead of a two-year-old because i was doing all the two-year-old stuff and she would get so bored and sew over it and finish in three seconds and then move on so i've been having to challenge her so i'm gonna look up just on pinterest i literally just look up three-year-old montessori rotation find stuff on there um i followed tons of different accounts on instagram too so i'm just gonna hop on there and see any activities um and then let's uh rotate these toys out i'm gonna put on my chill christian playlist my friend esther made this playlist has some really good worship music so i'm gonna play this and i'm gonna start cleaning   do   so   okay rotation is done it didn't take me that long ari has just been straight up chilling but basically i just take everything out first then i go in the playroom closet and configure a couple of things once you guys are done watching this video you should definitely watch my other video that i did on how i organized her playroom and how i configured my extra space where i keep all of her extra toys because i only keep out probably 10 of the toys that she owns out for her to play with so um in that video i talk about why i do that how i do that all that stuff so once you're done watching this video definitely go check that one out but um i'll show you a quick little rotation of the things that i did her kitchen is over there i kept that out um in here she normally has any of her little dolls and then over here i did this color sorting thing so there's three different colors and plates for her to sort these into this is a little b activity that she has to pick them up like this this is a little dot activity so she has to put these little dots into these holes this is a little activity where she is to do the dots   this is stacking this i need to get the droppers but this is a sponge and it turns into a huge giant sponge once you add water so i'm gonna have a little squeezy drop so she'll drop drops of water on top of it and watch it grow another color sorting but with this again and then this is an animal sorting with cards so that is all of her toys ari actually is able to access anything that's low so he's heading to that basket totally fine this has his stuff um i don't know if you saw the beginning of the clip but i took this basket down this is all oh great and then down here are ours so normally i just take this put this down and he explores and plays so there's just plenty of those little random things in here that he likes to play with and then anything that alexia plays with he'll also play with so he keeps himself pretty busy i don't really need to entertain him he's at that exploring age right now so i don't worry too much about it okay now that the playroom is done next thing are our rooms so ari's room right now looks pretty good um i'm just going to put a couple of things in place so gather up those binkies here's some laundry never put away i'm gonna put that away um other than that i'm just gonna make the bed and then he just has like a couple of random things that are out of place so i'm gonna put that stuff away situate that a little bit and then we'll be done with scissors   so       is there any under the bed   okay   all right little recap of what i just did everything upstairs is clean and done um for my bed you guys saw i don't make my bed on the weekends i actually leave it open so it can breathe um i learned this from sarah therese she says that at night you sweat and like you know gross things come out so it's nice to let your bed breathe every once in a while so weekends i just fold it over let it breathe we do our sheets every tuesday so i actually do laundry during the week um i don't do it on the weekends because it's just i don't know for me it's so much easier to do it during the week so as soon as i wake up i put a load in not every day but normally i'll put it loaded oh no as you see actually woke up but um i put a load in first thing in the morning and then throughout the day with me and crying for me mm-hmm during the day i will switch it out and then at the end of the day once you and me once the kids go to bed or whatever just click i'll just put the laundry um away all right so um i picked up the kids room or my bathroom really quick and up here is done so let me show you the pile of things that i have that need to go downstairs so we can get started down there like i was saying ari was playing in here while i was cleaning i'm going to leave this just like this because they're going to play in here in a little bit too she hasn't noticed that the toys are rotated just yet but this is my pile and this is my makeshift um baby gate because right now we don't have one ours broke with a lathe yes so i have just like some water bottles a box and these shoes i like to keep downstairs because i use them a lot and then those balloons were in lathey's room um i actually threw the other balloons down this way so those are all things that need to go downstairs i'm going to rattle up the kids and head downstairs i'll probably put a show on for them to watch while i finish cleaning up um on the weekends i don't care if they watch tv so ari is really determined to climb that poof we're taking a quick little lunch break i just warmed up and there we had it last night um and then i'll put the kids to watch a show and then i will situate and clean up this mess we got going out over here   so   all right we took a quick little break we had lunch and just been chilling for a second to recoup and re-energize because i really don't want to be cleaning anymore but um i just watered my plants all down in this area and then just a little strategy so first music but i won't be able to listen to music because lately is going to watch a movie so i can put headphones in or something but excuse me   do you want a snack okay come over here then baby sure you want to eat on your tower baby sure um and then after that yes baby you want me to take your baby   okay um and then after that my strategy is to group things first so for example i'm just going to pick up around so any dishes i'm going to put over by the sink anything that needs to go upstairs i'm going to put by the stairs any kid toys i will group and put together um i like to just i don't know i feel like it's more effective to do it that way and then i'll tackle all the sink stuff then i'll tackle like vacuuming and picking things up putting things in place um because i don't want to keep going here going there going baby um i'd rather just save my energy and make as little trips as possible so um just makes life a little bit easier that way           okay the kitchen is nice and clean this whole downstairs part for the most part is done i just have a couple of things to do over here in the laundry room or in the mud room and mudroom closet i just gotta put a couple of things away um and then i did just vacuum my office area put everything away here jordan just has to put his backpack away but for the most part down here is all done um i just wanted to show you over here so these are things that i found downstairs that need to go upstairs so not that much stuff once i go upstairs later today i'll take that up and the stuff that's there i will bring down you can probably hear ari but jordan is up there with him um so all that's left to do now is groceries for the week so it was kind of an off week because we came back from vacation so we did do our groceries yesterday normally we do them on sundays so i have an entire video showing you guys my process for this but on date night which is sundays for us um we spend like 15 minutes prepping our work week and our grocery i will have my video linked down below on how we spend anywhere between 100 to 150 each week on groceries how i have made it very cost effective how i spend very little time how we are not wasteful use everything that we have and how i plan out my meals for the week so i'll leave that video down below but that is all that we are going to do so um yeah i feel like that's it one last tip that i forgot to give is i always like to set up like a goal or like something for me to do after i'm done cleaning because sometimes it can get a little daunting it feels like it takes forever um this whole thing probably took me about four hours but i do have two kids i did take a break in between we did have lunch so like it wasn't that long um but setting up something fun to do afterwards is a great thing whether it's like getting a coffee we're gonna go sledding because it's like so cold and snowy outside so that was like our little goal so i hope you guys enjoyed this video and that it's helpful i'm gonna do tons of more cooking videos more just like practical videos of how to make life easier as a mom or just as a person in general so hope you guys are excited for those i love you make sure to subscribe if you haven't already and i'll see my next video but stop faking i feel like there's no way you can have too much sex boy do i wish he could read my mind and you will really thank me in a couple of weeks okay listen everyone is out here having sex doing the doing but nobody ever really talks about it so today's video is going to be a continuation of my girl talk series and we are going to be talking about sex baby let's talk about you and me this is going to be my third episode so i have two other ones that i have out one about being a christian wife and then another one about menstrual cups so i'm going to leave those linked down below i'll make a little playlist if you guys want to check those out after today i'm going to be sharing with you guys a couple of tips on how to improve your sex life i'm going to be cautious in this video to preserve my privacy and like not spill all the deets but in for me just enough to help i it's videos like this i really enjoy watching myself i think there's like such stigma around talking about sex especially in the christian community and i think it's such a toxic thing i will give you a quick little background on me so my husband and i waited until marriage to have sex we were i was 20 he was 22 when we got married i'm now 24 so i've been having sex for four years um well almost four years and two of those years i was pregnant so we got married we were married for a year and then i got pregnant and then after that six months later i got pregnant again yes i know how to use birth control i just choose not to okay all jokes aside i did need to have my kids close together so that's kind of like a little background on me i love to talk about sex not because i love sex because i do but because i am trying to break that stigma i'm trying to make people comfortable talking about a very natural and normal thing like i don't understand why people get so uncomfortable talking about it like literally everyone does it how do you think we have so many people in this world like hello there's god created sex we should not be ashamed of sex god loves when we have sex that is his thing he made sex for us to have so i will be specifically talking in the context of mine in my husband's marriage i cannot speak for anyone else's marriage obviously i have six maybe seven things that i have written down that have worked for us and i hope you guys enjoy this video because from the from the questions i asked you guys this seems like a very hot topic a big thing that i noticed so on instagram i just vaguely asked you guys what's something that you guys really struggle with and everyone basically had the same like three to four answers that was no sex drive embarrassment or ashamed impatient too tired um and the list goes on and on but all within very like everyone seems to struggle with the same thing so with you guys knowing that my husband and i were virgins the first year of our marriage i would say we were kind of figuring out how to even do it what to do kind of exploring our bodies exploring each other and seeing what it is that we like i'd say right now we got a pretty bomb sex life even after having two kids and i think it's very intentional and so i'm of course i'm not no expert and i'm not here to like have you compare yourself to my sex life because that's not what this video is about it's more so about empowering you and your husband or wife um to get you guys to reconnect and love on each other because the enemy does everything in his power to get you guys to want to have sex as much as you can before you're married and then after you're married he tries everything possible to not have you guys to have sex and connect is not not the like the truest statement ever so um let me take a sip and let's get into the first one i'm gonna start kind of boring and then we'll get more juicy so first thing is date night this has been probably the biggest thing that has changed our marriage this year is date night like i said we had two kids back to back we were married for that long before although we did date for five years before that again we weren't having sex we weren't married like it's just different once you get married so um date night has been crucial we get to connect we get to talk we get to communicate we get to just be with each other without having your kids because there's nothing more frustrating than wanting to like spend time with your spouse or have a serious conversation and you can't because you have a toddler every five seconds going i want snacks i want popcorn i want chips you know it can get a little frustrating so date night has been great because we're able to connect and i mean like not having date night so we can have sex but literally just so we can talk because sex starts outside of the bedroom and that is a hundred percent true for most women like most women you need to have that connection we are not an on and off switch like some guys are so we really need that connection before getting into the bedroom so having date night having that communication having that time together has been a huge game changer next one has been a sex schedule so like i said with our kids it's really hard you cannot have spontaneous sex i mean you can but you're gonna have a toddler looking at you like what are you guys doing it's not fun we recently had alephia actually walk in on us um because she learned how to climb out her crib so that was a first but it was on our schedule she just so happened to come out of the crib but having a sex schedule allows you to carve out the time and make the time because before that we weren't really ever doing it because we were just too tired we didn't have the time sometimes like it was just we were just not on the same level we weren't communicating with each other so however much you want to have sex i mean i feel like there's no way you can have too much sex you can definitely have too little find out what it is three times a week four times a week every day whatever figure out what works for you guys and then figure out a time for us night time is basically the only time that works we work during the day our kids are here our family is here you know we're not really about to be doing that during the middle of the day like that so spontaneous sex doesn't work for us scheduling does now i will say after doing the whole scheduling thing for a couple of months we have now graduated and i feel like we've reached a point where we don't even need to schedule any more because we already know and we already like in this rhythm that we don't let more than a day go by anymore so that's been fun next one is to communicate and this was something that so many people mentioned when i asked you guys your struggle i think there's a lot of shame and embarrassment within communicating what you like and what you don't like and there's no way you are going to let your partner know that what they're doing you don't like if you don't tell them i know i wish men could read minds i wish boy do i wish he could read my mind but he can't so i need to communicate that and i need to communicate it well if there's something that they're doing that you want them to stop let them know if there's something they're not doing that you would like for them to do it let them know what that is this definitely comes with becoming one you shouldn't be ashamed or embarrassed of talking to your spouse about your sexual wants and sexual needs obviously that comes with comfortability like being comfortable around each other that comes with a lot of vulnerability too i remember when jordan i first started having these conversations because i mean we had them pretty early once we got married it did feel kind of weird but then after that i feel like you just kind of get over it you kind of get used to it and you're constantly changing and evolving i feel like we frequently ask each other like did you like this did you like that like are you into this do you want like you know just ask just communicate to each other and this is not one of the things but stop faking girls why do girls fake the o's stop faking them you are never gonna experience a real one if you keep faking stop faking it i know so many people that do this don't you got you can't you can't because then you're never gonna experience a real thing but again that comes with the communication letting them know what's working what's not working what you do like what you don't like and that just comes with practice and that's the fun thing a lot of people made fun of me when i was in high school for not having sex before marriage because they were like oh what if you guys stuck in bed or oh what if this sucks or what if they're like the worst person ever it's like that would not be possible because we are going to try everything that we can to make it the best that it can be and that's between us we will work that out with each other like if you work at it you will figure it out there's like no way to not so just put in that extra time i know that conversation will be uncomfortable but push through and you will really thank me in a couple of weeks okay you don't have to vividly tell me why you're thanking me but just you'll thank me soon next up now we're getting a little bit more juicy here okay and that is to set the mood all day long so let's say you are following the schedule okay that day especially girls what is it that you like that your husband does that makes you feel loved that makes you feel happy that gives you butterflies let him know let him know so he can do that during the day so for example i love when jordan is like physical to me or like hugs me kisses me compliments me whatever that's like my love thing so when he does that i feel loved and i love that and i'm like oh you're cute you know and then it just makes you happy and then you know other things lead on so the day whatever it is set that mood during the day so you get excited so you know it's coming because i used to get really frustrated because i would feel like jordan would ignore me not on purpose but just like wouldn't really pay much attention to me during the day because he was working or i was working we were both busy whatever and then come night time he's like oh lovey-dovey i'm like dude you just want to have sex all the time but like you ignore me during the day and i would get frustrated and that wasn't the case at all it was just i never communicated to him that i liked that attention beforehand and that i needed a little a little juicing up beforehand you know because again we're not on enough switches we need that time so set the mood all day but then also beforehand like you can't just like jump into it and again i'm speaking from a perspective of mostly women not being as ready as men they're it's sometimes switched again it just depends but most of the time i'd say that most women take a minute or two maybe 15 minutes or two you know i'm saying it takes a little bit longer so do what you need to do beforehand and don't just rush into it it is a marathon it ain't no sprint okay it's not a sprint now let's talk into boundaries more specifically pornography now i cannot say enough bad things about pornography and you probably thought i was going to say all these good things about it and how that's improved our sex life absolutely not if anything if there is something lacking or wrong in your sex life it probably has to do with pornography if that is involved in any way pornography does nothing more than completely squash your creativity squash your self-esteem squash your connection it does everything wrong and everything to mess up your relationship because it's taking away from you and your spouse and it's putting this fantasy and this fake reality that is not real at all and just absolutely fake if you and your spouse watch pornography together i would definitely cut that out if your spouse watches pornography by himself cut that out there's just so many things wrong with pornography nowadays and i know so many people that struggle with addictions it's just overall the most toxic thing in our society in so many ways i could literally make an entire video about this we've actually wanted to do a podcast on it but we didn't know if that many people would be interested so i'll link our podcast down below and if you would like an entire episode on this definitely let us know down below in our marriage and our relationship we have not struggled with this thank the lord because i jordan no siree so if you are struggling with that there are so many websites and different accounts that you can get apps that you can get to block any of those from your phone so you can't access it because i would say that's the biggest struggle with our like generation is the accessibility you can literally at the click of a button you can find it even just going on instagram you can literally find it anywhere so i think the accessibility and how easy it is to get to like that has made it drastically increase so it just squashes so many things um jesus said on the sermon on the mount that if you if you even lust or have these thoughts you've already committed adultery so it's not even that you're acting on it if you even had those thoughts you've already committed adultery and i would 100 say that watching pornography is the same as cheating on your spouse because you are fantasizing and you are lusting over this person instead of your spouse and that is that not what cheating is you know you may not physically be touching that person but you're thinking about it and wanting that and scripture says if you even think those thoughts then you've already committed adultery cut that out get creative within your marriage again back to the communication thing if you want to explore some things okay set some boundaries what are your boundaries let those boundaries be known what are you okay with doing within those boundaries for example our boundaries are like sex is limited to just jordan and i we're not bringing in an outside person we're not we're not doing any of that we're not watching any other people we're not getting ideas from anything else we're not doing all of that it stays within us too so set your boundary set up what it is that you guys are both comfortable with and then again this is like in a biblical base i'm not going to tell you what's wrong and what's right because i know it can get very specific that's something i definitely talk to your pastor or someone that you're involved in your church with you can like have this conversation with because i'm not going to have a conversation about this like over a youtube channel comment section you know i feel like it's a little personal to have that conversation there definitely just talk to someone again i'm trying to break that stigma so we can openly talk about it because everyone has these questions so now moving on to my last one um this one can be a little bit different so i know a lot of people struggle with body image this was something that i really struggle with after having my daughter i'm gonna link an episode down below from our podcast that i describe our first time having sex after having a baby and i just kind of walk you guys through how that was so i will link that down below if you guys are curious but that was something that i struggled with a lot was just like my body image because it was just so different from before so for me i loved wearing lingerie and i'm not going to tell you that you need to or not but it helps me because it helped cover my mom pouch it helped make me feel like a little bit more sexy and i feel like lingerie is definitely like either people hate it or they love it i just feel like you need to find what you like or what your spouse likes so again communicate with them but for me i liked it because it just helped me hide a couple of things that made me look really cute and i liked it and whatever so maybe i'll link some of my favorite ones down below i love victoria's secret but yeah that definitely helped me a lot another thing that i really liked was that i started sleeping without underwear on and i actually started doing this when i was pregnant because underwear was super uncomfortable but then also like when we'd snuggle at night you know just makes life a little bit easier so find little things like that that really help with you guys when we first got married we used to shower with each other every single night um after we had our daughter it became a little bit more difficult we still tried um showering together it's something that we love to do because it's just a really intimate time and he can wash your hair you can wash his back like get explore okay have fun with it just get creative again that's why i don't like pornography because it takes the creativity away from you because then you're comparing yourself then you're seeing like oh this person can do this or i can't do that oh this wow oh you know your mind just like goes to all these different places so to just eliminate that and not have that at all you're not going to have these thoughts you're not going to have these comparisons because comparison would be like the biggest issue and again i can't speak for anyone because jordan and i have only ever slept with each other and thank the lord because i know if that wasn't the case i would constantly compare myself or just have those issues on the back of my mind so for us that's not something that we struggle with if that is something you do struggle with let us know in the comments below maybe someone else you guys can private message and talk about how you've over conquered that or worked through it um but those are my tips for you guys i know it wasn't as specific because you know not gonna be that specific i had a couple and i ran them by jordan he goes yeah you're not gonna share that online and i was like okay fine but i hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know what you would like for me to do for my next girl talk series if you're not already subscribed make sure to do so down below so you don't miss out on my other videos i love you guys and i'll see you next week bye
