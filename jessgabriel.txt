said this is it are you nervous yes here we go another day I'm extremely excited for this vlog by the way any reason I am NOT but I mean it will be a good one I just learned nothing I'm not in on it well that's why Seb is gonna get here in a little bit you guys know Sebastian the guy with the moustache he's gonna get here soon and we're going to explain everything to him give him the lowdown we'll explain a little more in a second quick disclaimer I know a lot of people I have different views on tattoos and stuff like that especially in a Christian community and a way of a big Christian audience and religious audience in general so if you like tattoos great if you don't it we're not trying to be divisive here we're gonna link an interesting video in the description that kind of talks about it from a biblical perspective everyone's opinion is valid yes and your great friend said lots of like tattoos he has a few and so that is kind of why they doing this video yeah and you're entitled to your opinion and that's that we're getting into it but first coffee got the seat drink it just so you know guys guys guys guys the reason just drink it is because an espresso just thinking espresso he gifted me a bunch of Nespresso pods cuz I get in this president it was very exciting even for me cause being young but one of the things was low as a flavor almond cake yes almond cake and I was like that sounds amazing it's gonna be amazing yeah so I've been making that one since just loved it so much wasn't try it and I was like babe like you don't like coffee so you're not going to oh you got some oh it's just like it's coffee yes but then after like five seconds then it's like that taste and I'm like it's not bad all right everybody this is um Jess this is Gabriel this is Jess and this is Gabriel welcome to our Channel okay guys so jess and i went through this whole okay there was this big like fiasco in our relationship remember when Sebastian and Bobby with who are both coming over like in less than an hour by the way Sebastian and Bobby both came over and gave us a presentation of why we should get tattoos and it was hilarious the battery was I was just gonna say that it's one of my favorite flawlessly stay it's hilarious manager you're just here tattooed but then the the the dilemma was was that just kind of didn't want me to get a tattoo she didn't want to touch me but I kind of learned the tattoo and we were like flirting this line I should I got one should I not what's the deal and then just was like okay I want you to think about it first because he's pretty you're pretty like extreme with you not in that way but I wanted him to have time to think because it's a live long on your buddy type of thing yes you might change your mind yes you did change your mind not about the tattoo I still love it no but sir I was saying have some time to think about it I don't have my residency you is that we are dancing yes just didn't have her residence yet and she's like hey look I'm waiting for this thing at this point in time she has it now obviously if you haven't seen the dawn com-series that's something you're gonna want to watch off at a card right there I was like why don't you sit on it till I get my residency because Australia and the Optimates you can be still wanted yes the time came and I was like you know a babe I think you're right I'm not ready for that kind of commitment the issue no no this like the issue was was that love just said I'm an all-in kind of guy if I got one I don't know if that would sit with me well I probably won't let it you would want like I want a few more in the region you know but I'm like inside the small tattoos and I'm like if you have like one here and then you have like you know just another one kind of like there that maybe somebody's on your bicep but Bobby's kind of all over but it's still small they're small but they're like small polka dotted all not polka dot but anyway that's what you would end up like it same you know not over time I would have gotten like a few maybe like three to five small ones around just to I complete like oh that's my look with that though I was like I don't know if I want that to be my look so I don't know if I don't want to get the first initial tattoo I - glad I gave yes fast forward about six months at this point now Sebastian walks in and this is basically what happened guys I have an amazing idea can we please all get matching tattoos nah I have a better idea yeah what'd you get a tattoo that I get to pick out we vlog it and then we get some amazing content that you're expensive yeah perfect I'm so excited to blog this you guys okay jess is an actress sorry mine Gabriel come back yeah sorry sorry I'm a Viner don't judge me I'm Annie boy now guys but uh the boys are coming over do you even say you something over Bobby and so Bobby of ours coming everybody you have two minutes yeah 20 minutes I haven't told yes what my tattoo idea was now sorry I kept off see to me and he was like no I have to ask me on camera like wait I wanted your reaction so it's it bad no no I had my tattoo idea for so long and I knew what it was what I wanted to be and since that's not a thing I'm gonna put up my head but but I'm gonna ask him when it's favored by the nurses and then take the same concept he's telling us his favorite BioMed's I know you're a good friends we would know it my original tattoo design was - do you guys know our favorite bible verse which is first Corinthians 10:31 whether you eat or drink or whatever you do to do it all for the glory of God no I didn't want like the typical Christian tattoo of like just putting like the full address it's like first Corinthians 10:31 he had to do something Amy I just have this I have so I came up with this whole design it's something like this is a very rough version but like it looked like this and it's like just a simple small tattoo obviously it looked better because you know you picked the right font and everything but it'd be like that with a like a - a long - in the middle well this is the thing I do want his input a little bit because I so I'm not gonna put 10:31 we'll ask him his did I just write on my face they had the pen open and I went like this I wanted to for his Bible verse so we put whatever the you know chapter and verse number is and then put it like this but then also he has depending on where he wants it it could match some other part of his body so let you know like he has one on his right thigh maybe on his left body he can get like a small version but it's in the same font as the one on his right there there's something like that show you need to discuss with him I'm gonna tell him like you have some say in this one wait wasn't the second video gonna be super interesting because he hasn't seen it so we realized that our conversation was said ended somewhere with he's not gonna actually know like seed the tattoo until it's out actually on him I think yeah I'm pretty sure he was okay with like not knowing what it was having it tattooed and then see him I think he what he had a few conditions up he wanted to pick the placement and he didn't want samples yeah and then I would just ask for the favorite bible verses and based off that yeah but that is mine so still wouldn't know what it's going to look like yeah but then a part of me will always be with him so this was like the original thing that I wanted it's like 10:31 that's bad you know what I mean like just like right here something you're like I'm right there something like there but said going on you see you soon big boy oh gosh my I got her I got her did you not even see me walk in my lair I know that was crazy we're still waiting on the boys right now cuz they're decided to take their sweet ol time last week when we plan this we were like we'll meet at 12:00 then that got changed too oh yeah you guys have getting here at 1:00 that's fine Bobby we know every single time we're like yeah one is fine since Bobby likes to sleep in til super late I'm calling you out Bobby on the blog I'm just calling you out it's tree today oh it's so true but then now they're

clearly very excited for this guy's welcome for what why you guys are so freaking late it's my fault oh yeah new puzzle dude I finished it except I already finished his puzzle what would you do I hope

to show you   they fit all their bones may be scroll social media yours made a whole movie yeah that's good you're the star in Europe so game-playing tattoo you're not seeing it until it gets on your body oh okay I just wanna make sure he's been telling me things what am i said he's like Bob make sure it's something up no circles nice our goals I think I'm not really into circles right now you remember my tattoo yeah Pat my idea yeah   you guys saw right then listen what that's kind of cute right it's yeah just that okay well I'm sold but obviously like a cooler phone if he's getting longer than 412 so before just to 10 to 40 probably okay I just super small and simple like somewhere any thoughts like that what I should do why should she notice are this line into a circle I know I'm very nervous you know I don't know yeah what what's the best Luke chapter 2 verse 10 I was right was thinking I already got that tattooed so I wouldn't want to repeat a tattoo Isaiah 40:31 pretty much attached it says oh my god see the lover of evil bro back to me people be like what's like your favorite bible verse recently and I'm like dude I just came across a proverbs 16:3 the other day and it really loved it like I would say I don't know I don't remember at the moment I know three verses were pretty nice they sounded nice those who trusted in the Lord will find new strength it will sort of Highland wings like eagles they will run in that grow weary they will walk and not faint 40:31 boy very much yeah that's a good one what if I didn't get random numbers add to that maybe this is more like picture based okay how big is it it's pretty big I'm gonna need like a full biceps I'm like what I know about timing no tattoos it's gonna be bad like two two and a half hours but what are you talking about - with it two hours details like a big oh yeah you didn't say no little small pieces let's say you roll back do you guys make circles like curly I love circles I think can I get a big

could be totally cool right there now we have to go to your visible we have to go to your sever you freaking out alright guys we are on our way to the concentration I'm feeling pretty good okay yeah I

look another day another surprising my husband if you're new to this channel you will soon land I love surprising gave like nothing makes my heart more happy than surprising him and just seeing his face he's very happy it just fills me with like the most joy Abbasi today is Thursday March 5th and tomorrow on Friday Gabe and I are flying to Nashville I didn't even know where to begin so we have a producer his name is Danny he is also one of Gabe's really close friends like they're really close now it's really sweet so Jenny introduced Gabe to this band that he kind of discovered inside of listening to it's called um the band Kamino indicate got obsessed with this band like it's all he listens to in the car it's like all these things around the house like he loves this band they have really cool music and like a really cool vibe and he was just seeing and so much in listening to them so much that I was like oh my gosh he would love seeing them live thank your goal just to see I was like I wonder if they have any like current live shows later they are actually supporting dan + Shay who you probably already gnar and the next char is it so I texted my manager this time last week and I was like tell me if this is crazy but I'm gonna surprise Gabe and fly him to Nashville take him to the show and he was like oh my gosh I love it so my manager helped me figure it all out yeah we're leaving tomorrow he has no idea I dunno if I've mentioned it on YouTube but we've mentioned it like on Instagram one of our goals for this year was to be more intentional with dating and so we taken turns picking a date and taking the other one on a date and so he thinks this weekend I'm taking him on a date which I am I'm just taking him on like a very big day we share a Google Calendar for a business and just to schedule out life basically I blocked out the Saturday and Sunday I said no rescheduling date day he tried to schedule something on Sunday and I was like no oh you come I don't think he's suspicious but I leave Friday afternoon and we get back Monday it's hot to me to block out that amount of time without him realizing that it's a trick I do need to tell him some how to pack a bag anyway so I actually need to get booked a hotel that's the last thing that I haven't done I'm gonna keep filming when I decide like how I tell him and stuff I found one and it's right across that's perfect it's like literally right across the room you anything is with booking surprises me share bank account I don't want him to see that like usually if I have a surprise I'm just like hey just like drink okay look it sucked OOP that's the notification I don't think there's any way of him seeing this unless he like prison chow mein which I told him not to Hey fine clink let's have a drink drink another day another vlog this is our vlog so this is your phone sorry I wanna film a date this weekend okay myself it's gonna be fun I know it's gonna be fun you've been like

well my only suspicion is that it's overnight somewhere and we're staying somewhere else because you said that Sunday I need to keep free and open as well so I'm guessing like okay if sunday is part of our Saturday date we'll probably end up somewhere Saturday that will continue on a Sunday correct okay cool with that said you do need a pack a bag before like tomorrow at 3:00 with the Kevin you

can we get job and Danny's like just acting super surprised and super shocked say that's really funny that he just like fully doesn't suspect anything right now but what's really funny is it out retail aisle view from our window has a big date in shade there's like big dan + Shay trucks outside so I'm like oh my gosh he must think that I'm taking him to add an inch a shower which I am but he he'd be confused at like why I would be doing that I need to go pick out the tickets from lil Cole so I think I'm gonna tell him now but I don't fully know how I'm going to tell him I'm gonna tell him that I need to pick up the tickets but I'm not gonna tell him those four tickets I'm not gonna tell him Jenny's coming cuz I still want that to be a surprise cuz he's just going to freak out when he sees Danny anyway that's my little update I mean I let him come back to the con now but yes the surprise is happening like right now all right so I think we should head back to the hotel yeah we're gonna tell me now or when we get to that when we get to that why are we going back to hotel though cuz I need to get something what do you mean get something I need it don't ask questions boy want to know then you'll tell me you'll get some answers did you like sneakily bring something like what no I think tickets to a show yeah no no I'm gonna win that no I'm gonna tell you everything when we get to the hotel but I didn't really bring you anything what would I I thought you liked maybe left something at the hotel that you're like oh I need to now show you this thing and that's like gives away what the surprises no and what was that a whole long conversation about a little update but no you'll find out at the hotel but why did you say to that you'll find out when you watch it oh brother you guys stop keeping secrets from me alright come in here why the heck did we fight in Asheville I have no idea why did we fly to Nashville babe what do you think do you have any yes you're a % close isn't me looking across at that building look at that is that a clue at the building there's an arena next door there is an arena next door is there a show that's happening that is therefore well what what is happening do you know he's playing today damn sure you know okay you know having wild guessing is fine today Wow nice thing cleanest actually there no way no way yeah wait we're going to see the band Kamino yeah they're opening up for Danica no way what you got grand Jan a little bit yeah for sure are you kidding me guys my new favorite band at the moment is the bane Kamino you're obsessed yeah literally on the flight here I was listening to them I took the video of his fine no way listen you tell me no oh my gosh babe that is so funny what was it like a four-issue hour flight for three hours I was editing for the other hour I was just listening to the band committee you have been listening to them like four months four months yes you were singing them so much in the house and I was like oh he needs to him I was like I wonder if they're playing any live shows and I googled it and they just happened to be supporting and like Shannon Shea we love some of their songs yeah yeah great guys the view is literally the arena with Dan and shade trucks outside look this is our view and I was like he's really thinking that I'm taking him to at the end and shaky but that doesn't make sense because they're not like hardcore Janet shaken yeah I need to go get our tickets I then when I was to like grab a bite to eat this is a wild but we don't agree to that many concerts but I feel like this is like an exception like you love this yeah I actually like whenever I listen to their music I'm like man this must be such a fun like show to listen to live yeah they're probably gonna be so good live that's Riley here it is that thank you happy yes no dislike dating intentional thing this weird everything count is like a date this was like an extra this is insane what do I do now No I don't want you to think of it like that oh boy I wanted to surprise okay thank you I do good yeah you're wild thank you that's my new favorite word Wow when something's wild dude it's a while I think he's a little thrown off right now I'm a little I'm a little yeah does it all make sense I'm staying right here yeah it makes sense yeah the concert that we aren't gonna be able to show anything of unless we put some royalty-free music behind it yeah I think we should it's time it's time for the concert oh I'm so pumped so we can take the camera that we've log on because the lens can

give me a meter all right   hey guys another day another vlog it's kind of eating a crazy a few days I'm sure you guys know it with the social distancing and stuff I actually haven't seen Gabe in three days he's made the other end of the house but we really wanted to vlog today so I'm just gonna go check in on him see what he's up to see what he's been doing so let's go another day another vlog Hey what are you wearing alright guys at this point it is towards the end of our vlogging day that we have been having here on this channel at this up for this video I wanted to come on here and say that I found out something new that I want to run by you guys clearly we want you to subscribe from the Bell on all that stuff but what I found out is that there's like options under the Bell so if you turn on the Bell you can turn on all notifications or like personalized notifications or something like that so it's like get notified or get sometimes notified and then you can end up just not getting notifications for anything even if you have a bell on so I'm letting you guys know that right now that's the thing that YouTube now has that turn the bell on if you want to be notified especially during this time of social distancing we all are watching YouTube and we all want to be notified when our favorite youtubers post a video right baby what was it a little lame all right that's all I wanted to say guys also make sure your smartphone like in the settings you've enabled the notifications for the YouTube app itself it's a whole thing I know I get it let's get to the video I'm done talking sorry I'm sorry that yeah joke's on you because now I have my pants on good guys don't worry my pants are back on the promise and don't worry that was just a joke we haven't had three days but you can tell that we have been social distancing yes to have enough time to come up with a stupid idea like that actually babe what's been going on let's talk to them about it well do you take dr. now yeah well we heard that you guys have been staying safe taking the right precautions social distancing like we have right mm-hmm we will try to stay safe we've been trying to do all the right things feel our good measures to take a lot of places in LA clothes right now so we're just hanging in yep yes and we thought that we would vlog just what we do people might want to get our opinions on them the whole thing I don't think we should talk about it because we're not like doctors or experts so anything we say doesn't really hold it anyway but if you do want people to listen to like obviously go out the CDC and look at what they're saying on their website but then also someone who we've been listening to to get like proper updates and stuff is dr. Mike on YouTube through the link his channel below he's covering everything really well keeps us I guess thinking properly about the whole situation so with that said another day another vlog no look another day another say hi to Milo you missed yeah Maya you missed him you missed them all you have your wedding rings on what Sam you know isn't it yeah social distancing 101 mm-hmm things we can do

yes yes we have door a a a meter Hey it's difficult guys and worse you know we're still working from home clearly we're filming this video which is part of work but like two of my projects I've been

us I'm working on my phone to a meter babe give me a meter all right we are just hasn't been outside in four days yeah yeah and we're not too worried for ourselves we just don't want to get around other people and like get around all their people as well so like we're gonna go for a drive yeah get in the car go for a drive maybe crack the window down a little bit get some of that breeze on our face you know it's in that good fresh air and watch a little sunset and hopefully keep that meter distance you know you ever seen keep that thumbs up thumbs up this video I was flipping born ready for this babe are you kidding me why would you ask me such a question like that just asked me she said hey are you ready then hit record yeah and then that was my response but we are a hole in Drive what

vlog probably that dude like and subscribe turn you turn the belly    because of the thing but it actually feels really nice to just be outside even though I'm in the car boy doesn't but the streets uh I mean people is still driving around but there's not a lot of people like walking the street so in the stores things are clearly closed yeah which is good that's like really safe but it's just we've never seen lla like this it's just wild like our generation hasn't experienced something like a crisis like this but this is like a two on one with the pandemic but then that has caused such a financial I just I mean it's where I think we're in a recession and technically okay yeah are not I saying it's like very gloomy yeah well the times are like this is happening people could get sick because of all that people can now not afford yeah to pay rent and that all that stuff and then if they do get sick that's even worse you know what I mean there's just like a lot but it's it's crazy but it is interesting for people like us like I mentioned earlier you know some of you know our projects and stuff on hold so like we're not working in that regard we're very fortunate as youtubers to be able to keep working like this just keep posting videos because we work from home they do this from home so we can continue doing you know these videos and Jess has been able to do some of the brand deals that she's had this week as well and we're very very fortunate to have that so calling our thoughts and prayers are very much situation who are either and lost their jobs or just don't have as many hours and struggling to pay rent and bills it's like sending love your way guys this whole conversation might be really anxious for a lot of people Mike yes anxiety guys I read it a tweet today not the best place to get information from but I read a tweet about a lot of positives yeah I said I've happened ooh    yeah it was like they're working on a vaccine that they're testing now that might work and China's already in the recovery stages so like there's a light at the end of the tunnel at the end of the tunnel and I think that's a positive to look forward to as we're like in the valley of it all right now hope you guys are just staying that's my rant and cautious yeah and safe yeah try to make the most out of this situation enjoy your family enjoy your friends on FaceTime yeah what games yeah speaking of the board game that we mentioned earlier it was in a time like over Christmas break where I had a lot of time you know with your dad and we just created up making a

thousand views with a whopping seventy four point six thousand likes the runner-up - that was surprising the dance with Jacko's song just shy of 300 thousand with two hundred ninety 7.4 thousand views and forty six point three thousand which is great because that was like not a dance it was already on tick tock yeah that wasn't already a tip top tick tock but we made it a tip tock tick tock so that one to be the second-highest is like really yeah I think pretty good what's the third highest one here yeah I think good that guy should dances to the top three we'll all dancing this one clocked in at two hundred twenty eight point two thousand views and twenty nine point six thousand likes and the singing one did well one hundred seventy three point one thousand views with thirty six thousand likes and I think that had more likes then it did have more likes than the dancing one but not as many views that's interesting then people I guess don't like dogs anymore yeah because both of Milo's performed away the worst but not terribly it's so good the worst one was the one with both my like ninety-nine point seven thousand views I said 100 K yes but it has fifteen point one thousand likes

snack which is gonna be giving you some live updates a little chat we're just gonna sit here chat about what's going on hey mr. grumpy pants yeah stuff that's been going on yeah stuff that's being affected it might be a little shorter than usual but we just wanted to get one of those just like that chill chat I was talking to you guys chill chat with the Conte's chill chat with the gentillesse sorry for my head you know everyone's saying that they want to see a video of Jessica in my hair but I'm trying to grow it out is the issue I'm I don't know no are you kidding me it just cuts my hair in butchers it I well thank you guys for staying safe mm-hmm good yeah I don't even know which one to start with I guess we did start with like how travel yeah so a few vlogs ago in the middle of the vlog we had got the news that Australia had it shut down almost specifically the airline that we use shut down on travel to like middle of June that's kind of like the case across most of Australia like most flights internationally are just like that kind of ruin our plans for next month Australia at the end of April and obviously we're not doing that anymore which is for the best like that's what this thing that was at first like bit of travel for 20 of 20 basically the whole summer who are going to be traveling then we had planned in June June issue was what we were aiming for we were gonna travel to Europe and we wanted to do UK and Italy like I was texting my friend evany about like plans and I didn't hurry to fly with and stuff and we were so excited and obviously sort of like what if things are going on right now and the fact that we can't travel yeah but we wanted to share our plans that was a plan sorry and we had like a bland tentative dates you know calendar yeah like we had it blocked out we were like these dates in June alone we're gonna go we'll buy a flight soon then everything - everything went down yeah yeah you know we don't know how long this period is going to loss and how long travel is going to be like suspended and stuff but um I think as soon as it's safe to do so yeah we would still love to plan to travel to these places but the reason that we had no specific dates planned out was because as you know if you had seen one of our other videos that we posted to wish don't think that maybe we had mentioned that we are planning this year at some point we're planning to move out of LA the reason why we had these dates plan is because we wanted to move it we wanted to like do some traveling so in Australia obviously and then do some other traveling to places we wanted to go to UK Europe and do that before we had to then fully move yeah you know what I mean so our tentative date for moving and it still is that is August but things are very unclear right now yeah we're getting quite a few questions about like if it's being affected and people were asking you guys are asking about it yeah it could be way like still not exactly sure I think right now it doesn't seem like it is but like you we don't we don't know you don't know anything right now I'm not gonna happen with anything really sure we're definitely like stuck in LA not stuck in Le Beau is stay staying in LA now until we know more yeah you know wait and see but August is au tented a tentative month you know there's three we have a few months left here which is basically yeah basically you should post us on April 1st and be like guys we're not moving we're not leaving la anyone April Fool's too late now that's why it's so weird Jess and I have been just like like as we especially over the past few weeks of just like spending so much time in years it's wild like we're walking around and just like I don't know thinking of like all the memories that we have in this place and it's like really this was the first place that we bought together you know I don't even it's gonna be sorry I'm gonna cry it's gonna be like kind of emotional like I remember I remember setting the camera up in that corner right there sitting on the floor and talking about like moving into this place and this was all amazing and I remember like taking that thumbnail and everything and like getting the photo of us like kissing in this completely empty house and everything and it's like been two and a half years here it's gonna be so weird when it's empty again again I'm just gonna the waterworks you know but we're excited it's like we're really excited for the next the thing that's coming next but um you know change it can be like really emotional sometimes mm-hmm I don't know memories are just so good memories are so good to have and I feel like we have created some really cool I was just gonna jump off that and say like leaving LA like not just leaving this harm but leaving LA it's like we're excited to leave LA but we're also I'm think I'm gonna get really sentimental about it like our first apartment like this we met here we're gonna be back here like so much it'll be fine it's not I'm not crying you're right talking about that made that really real I know it's really April we're fine we're still here for a while I know and we were it's so funny like we were talking about this year to like we wanted to have so many more like all just all of our friends here having them over and spending more time here just like making like the last memories here and it's weird that like now it's we're in a situation where we can't do that hopefully over the next few months like towards the end of it before we actually move we'll be able to do those things that we want to do and do those Disney trips again go to Disneyland and hang out not just like being able to go to Disneyland but yeah we had I some people in my family that we're going to come out and then we had friends that were going to come out and we don't know your life if we'll even be in LA next time they're able to like travel here yeah everything else is going good you know we just like we're going it's very um like I don't want to I don't want to sound like I'm complaining I don't because I know there's so many other people and like worse situations than us but the quarantine thing is like kind of weird and strange clearly humans are social creatures because it's lightly very weird being contained it's like in two weeks and I'm already like yeah tweet us if you have any thoughts on anything we talked about we'd love to talk to you guys on Twitter pretty frequently and just a lot of people see what you're saying there's anything else travel kids'll moving probably I mean those are the too many things we just wanted to kind of talk about was like plans that we had I mean okay there are other plans that we have business-wise with projects and stuff that have been postponed to wait there was so going to happen a girl was going to be April and May we're going to be like messy and you know in my suit Dave took quite a big break from like working on stuff like making all of these cool things and over to like coming out literally guys there was one more thing one last thing for this specific project there was one last thing I needed to do over the course of two days we have a crew assembled and complete this thing to then prepare for the launch of the full project we couldn't do that because la I have what like went into lockdown three days before that was on the calendar scheduled we were gonna do that like three days before that we had to cancel because of the whole situation and just that has now delayed it probably three months until we can so it's just like it's just like Oh at the point where is like we're doing this it's been so even over a year working on this thing and like things being ready it's been you know when you're doing a big thing it takes a lot of different teams and alone it for people that like bring it to life yes sir anyway it'll happen it'll be bed of it yeah it's everything happens for a reason yeah I don't want to sound like I'm complaining but I'm just so excited so it's like but you know God's plan B yeah it's God's plan for us to be you know to be tick tock tick tock so that's whatever right that's what I haven't like to do this every day number one read the Bible number two is you know do my emails work out those kind of things by the end of the day that last bullet there is just blah that's how I think we've done that updates we love you guys yeah subscribe if you're ready for the journey of next few months with the projects and traveling and it's gonna be in the move and things

do you react to the booty you can tell that I was buying it I was putting in all the songs that were viral on vine and like that whole question was justified yeah have you ever been attracted to a fruit um no you can clearly tell I had no plan going into this video like you know how long we do q and A's now we have the tweets ready beforehand at least one of us to know what the questions are we're ready to go into it we keep the video moving forward and it's like not that you can tell I was just scrolling I find one and be like oh you're attracted to a fruit and if you're all wondering no I'm not attracted to it's pretty still if I was but if I want that could be a joke on what's a fruit that can be like reference that's what I see you I'm bad yes to those of you wondering if I'm attracted to a fruit still and now I am this apple of my eye yeah how tall are you 6 feet tall just go with that I didn't know like how to properly like clearly I still don't know how to make a joke so I might was like acting weird oh yeah I think I watched this before we and you know I remember hearing that question he wasn't very confident with your hand inside it so I was like is he 6-foot is he well I thought but I really am though that's probably when I was editing I was like yeah like that answer like that and then put I really am MT ggz asks that was funny that was a fun still like

rest of my life dude no well you still probably could it just like makes you feel good now yeah that's true I think the copies of everything Starbucks you just dirty that one out oh my gosh you want fight you want to fight Milo you want to fight that's the most controversial thing I've ever said on the Internet now every white girl in the world hates me yes yes he's like I didn't know how to make a joke I'm sweat and I'm like purse parading right now it's a good fee yeah but then if you think about it like what was I just doing school that's just the answer to all of our all the problems I know you want like a bit we had it yeah that's the impression of a dinosaur that sucked if I was a t-rex I'm a t-rex that's amazing this is horrifying this is a horror movie that was like the what's it called a theme I'm trained to think the dam of organ mandalorian how do you think of a good vine idea stuff just like happens in life that I'm like oh that's funny that could be a vine how did this kid make good content like I think the question I don't know I think she thinks I'm attractive and doesn't think I have any Talent what school did say one of mine yeah but like she goes how do you think a goodbye night in my reaction right now was he didn't one quality that you like in a girl if she loves Jesus because I want to end up with a girl who loves Jesus more than she loves me it has nothing to do with me and of all these questions I got one of them right would you rather see ariana grande in concert or Sam Smith you always make fun of me if I like have mentioned I saw what I saw

like oh this fine thing and I was like oh that's pretty cool I guess I'll just I'm making videos something happened along the way there you know what we would birthday I hate myself you all obviously a bit more put together because you already had a presence on like vine you already knew kind of how social media work but we're both still saying stuff that we like oh why did I say it like that I think that's just the nature of like teenage years like I don't think there's one person who looks back at their teenage years and thinks that they weren't cringy yeah Navan are you teenagers now that's how a color just gonna say like teenagers now they're like 13 and look like they're 30 teenagers that have like growing up with social media because we did it yeah I think you're just more

might we're going to wait together oh yeah that way I make some Taco Bell's statement saying that we love you can put in like lettuce to modern Pato cheese the like beef with we make herring seasoning it's really it's a good time it's really on and sit out the foot set up the fort we're gonna wait you know we're gonna make dinner if you didn't know that's what we're doing right now talkable let's

make itself is it or building here we come     I'm trying he has an idea I have an idea I know and we had a really high point a little corner ladder Hey just gotta find the right tools you know every man is only as good as his tools right yes we need to find a way to get this to stand straight for about ten hours we've gotten somewhere yeah like that looks great we are just figuring out how to hold it up on this side yes a lot of the perfect height but we need to find a way to like stand it up so this is a really heavy stump so like you know thank you right he got his belt   dang it's alive everyone I'd say we did it but he did it it was definitely his life science you know science yeah your mathematics mm-hmm I had it down I weighed everything measure everything out nothing was unaccounted for and this is the result it obviously looks really cute it does it's funny because like yeah there's like the wood the ladder you know the metal like the pieces are nice you know the aesthetic if you will and then all of a sudden we have like some plants up there you know holding it up from the inside you know completely covered it's good it's a good time do you think so and chill hang out switch Milo you enjoying it buddy come here come here do you like the tent you like the tent but I would say it's a success I think it's really really it looks real and then like from this angle of like where you're approaching and looking at it the ladder there kind of made you know it's not like a broomstick or something like that it's legit like a wooden ladder it's like Peter Pan you know and like they're you know have ladders and ropes are connected and it's like a hammock and all that kind of stuff I think any of you guys would be marching since 2016 when we in 2016 before we were married I would this is an improvement this is better than like we decorated the other one with like mice and stuff I don't think we have but this is an improvement as far as like how structurally sound it is and the overall shape aesthetically like stay and we can still watch TV he's obviously enjoying it okay dear okay so yeah I get it next yeah that brings me back to life yeah yes oh okay it is that time we have bad dessert some tea we have our switches yeah I think we're just gonna hang maybe what your maybe something but I think it was a very successful Dana it was a very successful statement I'm very happy with our performance in it good job it was it good I would do it again hi Milo are you happy with the fort yeah he's excited for sleep I love hope you guys are doing well staying sane and staying sane that's an important one yeah it's getting to people man it's getting to people we're all in this together mm-hmm to get but yeah I think here you guys hope you

and Milo Conti  what someone that's bothering you the most we're going to test some boundaries cashing ourselves we're testing our marriage is what's really going sorry how are we testing the boundaries here list they were doing the rounds on YouTube and we were like you know like a little late to the game but like why not we did watch a few videos that we found we're really entertaining and then I've just seen these I guess on Twitter and stuff I'm just seeing them kind of going around it was Carly curry and his girlfriend who we find hilarious they were reviewing different snacks and ranking them and as we were watching we thought it was so funny because we were like oh my gosh we would disagree on all of basically it was like you yeah yeah so we were kind of getting into little arguments you know while watching that video and then we realized you know what we should save this for a video and record the arguments that we have we've found like a candy snack tea list online we're going have to compromise somehow because I know we're going to disagree yeah well what we'll have to do is if we disagree they go into like a neutral space between the two you know unless you decide to do like a and hi do PL ok we'll figure it out it'll be through the old tactic of conversation and communication communication and talking each other intentionality okay first one miss you're good boy I have no idea what that is good Bart yeah I think I feel like I've had that like once or twice mr. Goodbar as a candy bar containing peanuts in chocolate I didn't like chocolate and peanuts I'm not a fan I was already gonna rank it low because like if it's not popular enough for us to know like oh that's a good yeah well it could be like popular in another I'm sure I like peanuts up so we'll put any Pocky have you ever had this no you sure it's Japanese sticks with chocolate on the end I feel like I've had them at once yeah I have ones as well happy wait I good I can't remember it was he years ago yeah I was home-schooled and Jess is Australian so a lot of the candies that many people have probably had we probably happen this is really popular there I know people love Pocky yeah I hope I'm pronouncing it right I would probably give it we can throw it's a deer eating people some people might get really offended though I would see Oh desi okay well do you see because I know it's a good snack but it's not it's not the top it can be in the middle 100 grand I've no idea what this is as well hold on you're breaking this by yourself Thanks well babe I'm just saying it's kind of like a chocolate bar that people don't really care about you know chocolate caramel and Chris dress oh that sounds good that looks like a really good time actually I want snack okay judging by the picture I'm going to do in - we'll need to see yeah Laffy Taffy what you haven't had Laffy Taffy when did you grow up on the southern hemisphere so it's like an airhead but like way harder and not as good yeah I weren't like that I'm gonna be candy person do like chocolate but not like yeah did you hear my joke earlier nice you were like Laffy Taffy what's Laffy Taffy I was like laughing happy what did you grow up in the southern hemisphere or something no Hershey's Kisses hey good those those are gonna

Thomas and cheese and sour butter is cold blah blah acid so there's an ingredient in the chocolate that's also found in violent and commerce and cheese an accident yes I mean google says sorry I'm in love has he crashes chocolate is that why because of a conspiracy theory no because I never really likes the taste it's a little different to like chocolate yeah Sharleen chocolate is on another level like Tim Tams but these are still RK you know I would probably ring this see Oh sno-caps come on babe no idea it was like a movie theater staple and you go into the movie because you get these things and it's just a little you know little chocolate like button is basically with like white sprinkles over top is not a bad it's a good time I'm telling you probably like Searby see see I mean I've never tried it butterfingers yeah are we gonna happen I would argue it is that the peanut butter one yeah and it just has a horrible texture yeah yeah like this next one did you clap yourself in the high something very milk chocolate yeah kaveri it's good it's going straight to end no yes dude that just plain chocolate does yes no no no no no no no hey Henri is the best Australian Calgary is the best it's not it's not s a KitKat is it s depends from which country but that's right we can revisit we'll revisit baby we'll revisit but I just I'm saying I don't know what I drink I get a mother say okay Reese's Pieces surgeries you know but I was looking at that hey hey ready compromise okay no no at least beer see I'll compromise for see I don't like peanut butter and chocolate yeah but this is like a tearless for all of America all of the world this is the official global 2020 official childhood candy tearless I know they are sorry popula like people would probably rank them some people would do it the haters are gonna come out I'm sorry it's in the top half for sure CID all right we'll see that's the same - all right we'll see yes well I mean same as Dairy Milk I'd do an a X trust your judgement Milky Way mmm that's like a between up being a D depending on your yeah I mean the Milky Way over here is different ten million Australia Milky Way Australia I drink and hey Milky Way here I don't I haven't had it enough I'd probably do like it see it's good I just don't see myself like sno-caps and racy species are under Milky Way like this tearless is arty jacked you know what I mean especially the Reese's Pieces two Milky Way okay why don't we do Milky Way on see we have Timoney season right now I know okay fun dip you know fun dip is an S for sure are you kidding me fun dip I got it all fun dip guys oh my word find it find it find it hot on what is fundus find it Jessica wait Jessica Jessica so you get a packet and whatever flavor you plus a little stick it's made a complete sugar which is perfect for for a kid okay and then you have the other packet which is also full of complete sugar but it's powder and then you lick the stick dip it in the powder oh that's an X I think never first that see I don't think we had this no not an s babe we can't be SM all right when we revisit at the end that may be my compromise me no Abby absolutely not there's no way arrow is above fun dip to never tried it it's gotta be a my it's gotta be an enemy of me next up jelly ranch huh um this is upsetting me it's like a like a dee dee we got our first date we got our first date okay what is this one runs runs runs was a good time grunts was it through we had something similar to this freaking good time dude but I wouldn't have them now is the thing I wouldn't have any of these now I don't need D or C that's equal to D okay what is it around everything Reese's Reese's Cups for me that's an ass what but you don't like peanut butter is the thing will see it will see it even though it's for sure an A or an S I want compromise for you babe okay sweet fish I'm gonna do like an e I know it I don't like bullies Oh selling chocolates God so how I used to like these what I don't like lilies but I did you know full Alizee so like them D probably Dean I used to like them bad all right Pez Pez pays to be her first s no but I do like this has was a culture though Pez next to fund it see I'm compromising different than you're compromising I'm compromising and letting you put them in the egg you're compromising and making me put them and be accountable what are you doing about Twizzlers f Twizzlers e e I would happen I would have them but not my favorite Jelly Belly yeah jelly beans those aren't know I never really liked jelly beans actually yeah yeah sweet Thomas sweet sweet tarts no stop stop mm-hmm only the pink ones am i right pink ones oh they look good be next stuff stepmoms okay next a fun dip though you know skittles I was never into skittles sour skittles that's what was that this seems accurate okay yeah again Oh gummy bears jacobean has not if the chocolate in that a is not the thing is if funded isn't an astronaut honest babe we would still eat gummy bears now I think it's just seven cents per different yeah how many fund up to now if I gave sugar okay weapons I'm gonna have to put in D you know why because we love Maltesers are better than love is spit up you just move the camera frame is off now stop moving it with your foot can you imagine if that break that would have been funny well yeah that would have been fine Maltesers I agree if we we can just knock both of these out right now I'll put whoppers see then Maltesers be but if you put Maltesers a most users are kind of an s Maltesers are in s they are you're right no doubt about it malteses aren't X Walker is a good to see this is the texture and the taste it's a little dimensional tease Maltesers it's an abyss do we have our first ranking well unless they all disagree with us and they're like H&E me stop X isn't it yeah I'm really curious to know like how how much hate we're gonna go this means let us know you're out of all of this which one you would do it ring pops no idea is that just a lollipop did you have a childhood Jessica an Australian on your finger and you lick the ring pump no I never had one of those and I put Ring Pop Sarah bees are solid for now for now look at be fun dip Pez and ring pops have like another element other than just eating all these don't tell me tell me uh I'm get we did have this actually you better have oh so like Aoki okay hey hey airheads that's a little bit in the like culture category as well I've had a lot of that they're not like the best honey yeah they're not but they're like this strip of just like taffy I guess you could say there was a good version of Laffy Taffy like they were deep alright whatever candy corn and be cool sorry where would you pick any con not this good and I sure since a hundred without a lobbers for my candy yeah that's the issue we're having three make gosh they're popular here yeah they're gonna probably be oh I didn't have them a lot jealousy all right well a couple nice again this is chocolate this a Tootsie Pop is an S you cannot fight it it's a lollipop with a touchy woman touchy rules could be considered ex as well they're here so that's gonna be another fight we're happy I just wouldn't put a lollipop in this did you ever have a Tootsie Pop no but I've had Lily pups well the howl of America hate me if I don't put it in at least b.o.b is offensive what B is doing Tootsie Pops a disservice what flavor is it there's different flavors but you have a tootsie roll in the center which is a chocolate core in the middle I know it I know it's so good why do you want to yes but Reese's PCs are better so it's gonna be like a baby for now all right nosh and then the tootsie roll where are you gonna put that candy as well no no well now that it's next to whoppers like yeah I guess so I'm getting so messy this is what I would do right here I go Reese's whoppers tootsie rolls now you can keep them in cann right for now like that doesn't look terrible yeah okay that's fine because I still get my f sanae's this is stressing me up it brunch is fantastic I probably do BOC by tear or two below pickup but it is this to me it's the second best chocolate oh that's pretty high alright double bubble I just never liked that a lot flavor within like three minutes no no it's a good time well yeah but hubba bubba over here oh hold on you're getting ahead of yourself here tweaks is pretty good Twix I think about Twix Twix is like I don't wait next to crunch I was just gonna we finally arrived we finally agreed on one thing yeah sour patch I do like how that they're up here with with trolley in the gummy bears all I am I would am okay if it was sour patch of watermelon mmm that would be an ass sure and you tried to argue with me on that one I would have I don't know that one more than the sourest they're the sourest oh no I'm getting a feeling right now - sighs - like evilly when it gets just like below see I'm just like me this one of the greatest guns any kid you had that was like the cool kid for the day you know I do what was it dots F yeah I don't know that isn't it it's an S I will put it in the end it's an S hold on okay captain Australia tastes different than Troy Bahia either way both are essence it doesn't matter it's a KitKat and Australia I definitely do it yes so you can't hear I'd probably do an A so I'm I'm having a compromised furnace lemonhead never liked those keep a surprise so good especially when you're a kid because you get a little toy - like a symbol inside the chocolate I mean I wouldn't die for one now but I probably put it in a B that's right I get it like on a cultural level it like it's not near the near the Pez because pads are like you know toy as well old oh it would be in a packet and then you like open the end you'd like pool lunch lot of time for your friends and stuff like that those were so good these are like equivalent with petroleum I don't know if I would put it in Sage being beaten will happen I think okay okay wait is there anything that you would like to change Oh 100% of a look what's the one that's bothering you the most thanks so much for watching guys we should come on that was a funny joke that was about I got a good one in there oh that's so rude you know what fund it's going to D now hmm right now if I were to go for a movie snack that I wanted to move up if he reaches PCs and trough in the trolley gummy worms I would move both of those attacks I love that that's not part of my house a category is really weak when the beat category seems really strong and why don't you move Reese's to a there we go if that moves a the 20 cops gotta move up and the fun day okay this is getting to Gabriel now no it has to be like pretty no this is getting to be what the people want please let us know guys what your s tier would be I'm really curious obviously if Renzi France so you don't come at me please whatever whatever I'm having the best here but everything after that is a little long a little bit a little blur I agree it is really messy but it's there any because my two different people with two different case you know what you guys deserve for making it through just my bickering for like 20 minutes rate some multis is gonna kick it out of you let us know if you want us to do more fearless and stuff yeah we found another one but we really be doing this for too long yes we were thinking of doing another one cuz we thought this would be quick clearly clearly we have we have issues to sort out yeah all right we love you guys see you next video peace out is it like a trimmer slice yes ash Rimmer   hello and welcome back to JT News I'm Jess and I am the another day another law and I'd like to come in here and just tell you a little story about what's going on today in the world so another day another vlog or horribly awful horrifying but you know what's not is my coffee but first coffee and if you couldn't tell it has a G on it which stands for gorgeous gorgeous Gabriel is what I call him that's what I was going for he's trying to get the compliments anyway you want to get into the video say actually on a pause real quick guys I wasn't gonna wear a hoodie today but I threw it on the reason why I bring that up is because if you watch the video with the hoodie on leave a comment down below if you're part of the hood squad I just mean that up now I don't know I'm saying that but it's part of the video now so it's quads a thing in our videos that's like when people comment like he's watching this without socks on yeah that's the thing you can only watch our videos with any time if you're not watching our video without a hoodie on then you're not that's what that's just what guys you have to be if you want to be head squad you have to do it I'm tee squad geez oh that's what hey squad yeah echinacea that's why all right so this video I'm excited for it I am too although I'm not like I don't know I don't know we should just jump into it as you just Philip DeFranco this thing to jump right into the so today I'm going to be quizzing Gabe on some female girly things so apparently there's two sections to this jess has three questions for me at the beginning then we'll go into looking at what's actually on the screen and my reactions to whatever she shows me so sorry I have I think it's about nineteen pictures of things dude you see my hair my head my head yeah he's not letting me cut it guys there's people with this thing I saw a video similar to this icon grammar he did it but I just wanted to say that but I saw someone else do it like I didn't make this up I am signing the three questions all right give me the cues this is like a little warm-up to all of the pictures that I'm going to show okay so this is like a mental warm-up to prepare my brain for what my eyes are about to see kind of so this is questions that you have to answer like what is this bah bah bah but then the picture is gonna be like you have to tell me what the use of that thing okay question 1 question 1 what is the difference between a pad and a lineup a liner a liner I've never heard of a pad it looks like an eye mask a sleeping mask but you put it in the nether regions it's kind of like a diaper of sorts so what do you think a liner is a liner is probably something that you put in your underwear that isn't like a pad that sticks but it is like lined in your panties can I say that yes that's my guess very clerks actually sorry Allina is knowledge and it's like four lives a day so if you don't need a full pad on your period gotcha okay one question and I'm crushing it what is the difference between wings fastener wings wings versus no wings okay I think that would be also a pad thing and I think it would be like parts on the side that would like stick to your leg or something like that legs are you not like the edges next to the not like your leg leg I've been doing it wrong listen I'm here - I'm here to teach you something there's some new techniques in you got it right though I feel like I've had one conversation about it and it was restored wings other like extra bits around the side yeah like stick it in place mm-hm no wing is just yeah good job - I'm surprising myself right now this is the last of the questions before I get into the pictures all right what is it pops me it's from the office yeah I remember because it perhaps me as Michael Scott asks about it oh it's when the the gynecologist has to like take a sample kind of like what a doctor does like a swab in your mouth they're like swabbing in your you know would you go check and what is that for to test for what it's testing for STDs right it's testing to see if you have like something STDs it tests for cervical cancer gotcha I mean you got it right technically saying that it was like they took a swab I knew what it was I didn't know what it was for yeah all right are you ready for the pictures yes I need a furniture something really good what sorry really quick Photoshop yeah yeah it'll literally take me to things all right well my wife is photoshopping I thought I would just talk to hood squat real quick and just let you know what's a good in the hood now it's pretty good sorry guys I'm really impressed with myself today I was home-schooled so it doesn't take a lot to impress me so you have to tell me like what it's cold or what it is it is okay yes mmm that looks like it would be if girls want a pee standing up they could pee out of that Wow is that right that's right oh dude knowledge it's fishy weak or I think it's called gargle /av good job I didn't think you'd know what that was all right oh boy hmm that's scary that looks like something that maybe a gynecologists would use to open the vajay to like a look inside or something yes good job I'm just guessing this is hilarious you get that right I'm just trying to think of what it's for great job honestly look it's critical thinking skills knowledge next one oh nice hmm ah I totally know what that is really yeah that catches your period if you don't want to wear a tampon or a pad there's like a cup that you can go in yeah big bring you've told me that there's a such thing as a cup before and I'm like I figure that's like the size that I just didn't think you'd remember that listen guys really well away better than I expected like wait for them way better yeah oh those are beautiful covers I use this I know what those are I use those yeah I'd like mess with them before because I'm like babies are so weird yeah I think about most people call them is pasties pasties ya know just never come in several colors okay oh my gosh this is annoying you're doing to that listen we out here we out here hey don't rest gotta close my eyes cuz part of the hood game I think this is a good game close my eyes cuz I'm part of the hood game like this video which is part of the hood game Oh what doc I think this might be your downfall it looks like it'd be a symbol you know like the Star Wars symbol how they have like they have like the rebellion and then they have you know the empire that looks like a symbol that would be for that getting in their starship I put my helmet on you put the helmet on and that symbols like on the side of your head vii andreza no I'm just saying alternate uses of what that could be form it could be perfect it has a handle on each time you throw it it's small yeah take a wild wild guess in the wild loveless what if I told you it was for a bro oh I take a little connector in the back the bras already have things that connect hmm yeah this one's tough this is a bra strap clip sorry if I have to know it doesn't know what I said it's a connector it's you have to bra straps you like wearing a tank top of something and you don't want the bra straps to be showing you have that basically in the middle of your back and sew the straps end up going in like that in the back oh so the straps that go this way yeah as I meant the strap that goes across the back gosh yeah that she knows before heavy oh here okay you'd like put your ponytail through it and then you wrap your hair around and it gives you like the shape of a bonnet you are too good we out here you're so good I think brands baby I'm so surprised honestly I'm surprised that was a guest - I just kind of put two and two together I just think like if I was a girl what would that be used for you know what I mean oh that's uh you have one of those a little shaver it's like a guy's um razor that like flips open then they do that but it's like for girls so they can do like the sides of their face or their yeah I've never used it but I know what it's for Oh what is that if you're back on all the times you connect the chain to it and then you put one over your what is that is that also a nipple cover yeah I have no clue what that is you tell you is a silicon Beautyblender like a beauty sponge I know I don't know how it works so you take it and you use it to apply makeup yeah what oh brother kind of torture devices that this part right here this one looks like it would be like what guys sometimes used to like clear out their nose nose hairs and stuff I feel like I've seen it before and now I'm struggling mm-hmm is it for like cleaning out things is it for cleaning something I don't know is it is it is it you have to tell me cleaning it away qvj yeah I was like that seems like a long long do you do that oh he's beautiful I don't know if there's like you want me to tell you yeah there's a really different one see this is when you're going to get your nails done oh I knew yeah ah yes I really thought this would be so easy to me I knew what that was - I think it you know when you like study for a test for a long time and you had the answer in your head and I never even questioned you know I know this answer I know and then you Mark something and then it's like later on you like see what that answer was again you're just like oh I got a real test just a relatable am i yeah - yeah say I was home-schooled select whatever also all right that's good close your eyes oh that's easy you know hey still don't have a blow-dryer and then you like curling good job that's great but as someone who you like doesn't hasn't seen that before I was like that's so weird to look at all right that was easy it's easy what you have when you have knowledge this is an excellent oh that looks horrific these are little razor blades right yeah something like that yeah or something like that well yeah I get I

wife for preparing it for us and I just pray that we have a good rest of the day to day a productive day even though distancing I pray that the world would be healed soon there's pray you have your hand over everything and ultimately that your will be done in your name we pray   I think if she's been jumping around a lot I know what you're talking about we'll see you on the other side back with breakfast yeah yeah yeah yeah God what do you think no are you an animal crossing I don't want to show you the blog because it's sorry bad because I'm so far behind so we'll wait for an update once you've figured out how to animal cross properly yes yeah I see people online and they have like these amazing islands with like streets and like so many things and I'm like jealous cuz I literally just have trees but I'm gonna show you my toy that's just a story I'm going to show you my toy I do want to I do want to see your Island but I'm trying it's off because I'm gonna see your Island say Cape is being very excited about this it's his like new little project for being in isolation look at him he's like so excited tada got a film camera so I'm gonna learn how do I shoot proper film which I don't think we'll be able to get developed I think we'll be able to if we like send it off yeah I'll do a mailing I'm pretty sure there's some places online where you can get it develop oh that's good but look this is our first time with like a real film camera your friends yes whole team stuff we shot a lot of what we didn't you know in film but someone shot say that's why he's in this fit because he like once David cool film for yeah that's the price I've learned how to use this but I haven't like done anything with it yet we haven't taken any pictures at my show yeah so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go on a walk because we're trying to go on a walk pretty frequently just to like get out we just a social distancing don't worry and I figured this time let me bring my camera and just learn how to do some film photography while we're out which is why I have like I should hop on and stuff because every day I've just been in like sweats mm-hmm but I mean jeans today this is from my collection with lenses so we're gonna take some some piece what are you doing putting the film in yeah I hope I do this right the suspense Wow oh you ready I think I did that too much for this one I'm ready are you ready is the thing yeah guys you're gonna witness our first film pic I really hope I get all this uh this right cause like I don't know until after we get the photos back it can all just be like completely under overexposed and stuff look how cute he looks with this little film camera right no one's around us they're being safe yes and I think I want to take my first photo of Jess here see this would be the time I would be like oh and then we'll put the photos on the screen after it's film day we're back inside we didn't vlog anymore of the walk we just took a few photos it's funny doing film photos I felt like I couldn't well had to concentrate so hard especially since it was my first time and oh hi my love you good bro I'm taking the pictures oh yeah because you're like okay is it properly exposed I don't know it's a framing good is it in focus wow that is that is way to zoom dude but like the time we spent we got I think I loved in photos because it's just like it's that one take you know and you got to get it right but oh god bless you mine I think we're gonna chill for a bit and then oh my gosh what should we do I don't know I think we should go someday I want to yes I think you know I think I want to go for a drive just to drive around get out a little bit still gonna stay away from people yes I think it would be interesting to if you guys have any recommendations of things that you'd like to see from us because it's a bit more difficult being in isolation and filming for you guys yeah we're doing it we're doing an extra on a week which is great because we want to get more content out because we're kind of like in a position right now where we can film more that's why we keep filming in this corner so much kind of reactions talking things cuz it's like we'll come up with an idea for that we're like okay that's great for a video but then it's like how much can we vlog I don't know sure you guys the same things every single time because we're just inside yeah so we feel like doing the response and being a little it's been fun you guys have been lighting them to let us know if there's anything like in particular love wise that you'd like to see here you're enjoying the ones who is sitting down and doing something every time I say let us know I always think of lettuce snow between two that to me once he is a guy now knows about it what does it sounds like I'm saying let us know why are you good actually gonna film photo of you buddy yeah you're the star hey Larry can you stay and be really cute you say awkward sometimes like look how he's sitting looking at little model Sun or see how Gabe says it in an Australian accent   oh gosh that took like 20 hours to make sure it's a few hours later so things are going great as you can see like golden hour it's kind of happening right now through the windows we have these streaks that happen in the house that we think look really nice I used some of the roll we took some photos we want to go watch the sunset no we're gonna hop in the car drive watch drive back it's safe I need to worry so we're gonna make some drinks that's what's happening now if you can hear it so I'm going to make my attempt at a Starbucks drink you're going to make coffee do you like to spend dinner if you like it's actually just as they do yeah it's cold up it's like I don't know I just wrap it up through it all and holds my hair back there's getting a little funky today it's got a little wild so you know how to tame these beasts you know letting maintain she's not letting me trim it anything so he has to like pull it back like that y'all y'all y'all come on don't tell me I know we just passed the bachelor house well apparently rumor has it Fighting's gonna be bad in 3 2 1 oh my word that is horrible one time I was driving down this road with one of my friend she was like oh this specialist the bachelor mansion it should be cold actually we're on our way to watch the sunset I don't know how much sunset we're gonna see we're in cloud right now we're in cloud that was funny babe that was funny here's the guy who'd like we have to believe that look at that oh my were like we are in cloud we can't see isn't that so cool this is just like on the highway right at the spot where we're gonna watch the sunset yeah we took a few photos at the other place just I'm glad we got to see we stayed away from everyone don't worry but we're almost at our next destination and I just don't think we're gonna watch the sunset it's so over it's so cloudy at least we got to pull on the side of the road and see that really pretty view yeah let me go kinda see the Sun in that view which was nice but um we are nothing but it's fine it's really pretty there it is there it is there is the sunset the economy talen camera it looks actually really pretty oh yeah there's a light streak something I mean I think we can just pull over yeah we'll try and just watch for a second you know yeah just say hey well this was an absolute fail but oh look I think I see oh look we should have known that there would be no parking anywhere near the beach because obviously all the beaches are closed ya know why I thought that we just we have to like scoot to the side of the road and sit in our car but there's like signs no parking signs all along that I've like put up like obviously they don't want people parking going to the beach but we thought we were like gonna be able to just like pull over and watch some business stay in the car and that's that's not a thing no and also it's really cloudy so I just think God's telling us to get higher but it was a nice drive it's actually so nice just getting it out of house my god and we drive through that really pretty beautiful Canyon that like looked so nice so I'm glad we got out we got to drive around yeah and we had to get out a little bit because it's it's good it's good for the soul guys just go for a drive hey social distancing you can do that it just it's good well go for a walk if you have to settle out - it just feels good during this so I think we're going to drive home I plan completely work yeah guys on set like okay they get okay I totally I think I saw it for maybe half a second okay no no again again you're welcome that's all they wanted the whole video that's all I wanted this whole video because look bachelor bachelor mansion that's totally honestly it probably that is bad some way wait isn't the bottom one or top one um I think it's I don't know I didn't even watch it oh that's totally it I'm sorry guys we went on a bachelor - uh bachelor we're home uhh Tarzan IRA well it was a good day it was a good day for what our days usually look like yes currently and it helped me feel a little bit uh mm-hmm I'm excited to get the film developed yeah yeah we're gonna make some dinner now and watch how nightly YouTube and to play some animal crossing I'm probably not gonna blame al so hope you guys enjoyed this video I know it was like super chill but it's tough to vlog in this time in this climate you've run out of things to do yeah I was thinking though comment below if you would want

you're in Australia or in that part of the world then it's probably Sunday for you and it's a Sunday sit down it's as hot as they come but for us in the Americas Sunday's it done clearly I need a drink this coffee yes but this is from if if you know everywhere this is from then girl ruin comment let's get into the video yes due to popular demand this we this was a hot topic not the store the video we are going to be watching our first vlog again yes we reacted to Jess's I'll leave a card there followed that part too we reacted to my first video Barse very funny things to groceries yes if you want to watch those and cringe go and win so yeah after you finish this whole video and now we are watching our first vlog together on that you're sitting and watching on right now this channels first video this isn't our first video on YouTube together but it was the first one that we did on this channel which was maybe like six months into our relationship yes right fully got engaged a little context in this video from what I remember we were separated and we thought it'd be a good for flog to vlog us coming together after being separated for a bit we did long distance she was in Australia I was in America and she came to LA and I picked her up from the airport and that's the context for this video I don't know if I have anything else except I was thinking earlier another day another vlog obviously wasn't a thing at this point and I was wondering when that actually became a thing flawless I know when I did it you were the one who count that yeah I said it one time look how fine look he never believes me if like I have done so like if I do this thing faster it's like I was the one who had an American he never believes me I'm agree sure I said but first coffee to you but probably you are better then I'll help me to it I'm not sure about that one but I know and I said and I'm Dana okay okay anyway with that said boom there Sheila listen it was obviously not that interesting because we got about a quarter of the way through it and then quick yeah that's how I doing it with Jack right in Australia he met all of us we had watched the first few minutes dude the fifth one in was one we've got engaged you wanted us to be posting on it before right because you're like I dare what a person on my channel good it's like an us thing oh yeah that was the reason I was gonna like document it but I wanted to make sure it was on it together thing so I was like let's start the vlog Channel when you come in hurry but I didn't want our first video to be like the engagement yeah I remember this now we're together again first here we go should we watch in 480p you've watched the other videos you know if you would get it you'd be on the inside joke and the inner circle you'll be part of the hood squad is gonna be so cringy like I already know I was sorry and you asked me to film my trip but I was so shy vlogging like it's all good flooding by yourself and I was so new to it that I like barely filmed anything when we reunited again we were talking about like how much we can film and I was like hiding in the Bible oh hey Bobby say hello oh my gosh my mom but they knew I was gonna propose to me so she was probably like she was in the inner circle yeah she was with your mom was feeling the way I feel right now yeah I was watching that conversation of us and I was like dude really yeah I hope I sleep why am I talking sex like that's Australian to go Alana you were so much more Australian then you are now yeah I mean I still sound similar yeah you're like yeah you can tell that you were you could tell that you were really uncomfortable oh yeah it was so uncomfortable commercial now it's a little bit more normal to see people filming even now it's jovian sometimes yeah 2016 vlogging was like it was in the come up my people were doing yeah definitely when vlogging channels like took off I was like the main thing yeah I feel that so jess has been on the plane for my little boy okay looks like the world's best boss to me never I will say is that your hair looks really cool you you want to cut it come so you want to just you know trim up the sides kind of a little bit I can do that I'm trying to grow it out trying to man Bob I know you you don't like me moans that's why I said it I like man buns I think they suit seven people how would you know unless I try to think you throwing me under the bus in front of all these people I love that look I just love like the shorter I love it doesn't mean I don't like this I think you look great too I'm just it was a jerk okay mister you think I'll agree probably like three hours now and it sucks because I can't talk to her until she lands tomorrow morning when I go got it from the airport you sound a little different to actually really a little oh let me FaceTime my other Australian friend that's why we looked at this video yes on the one with Jacko because we wanted to see his first appearance on the ball and that was it yeah I just wanted to start the blog tonight and let you guys know what's going on basically just probably already did I have no idea what she said on her part of the vlog but um Jack was dancing in the background and yeah I'll see you guys in the morning when I go to pick Jess up from the airport I'm so freaking excited this is actually such a sweet time to like look back on the nine before and like the morning off was always so nice like so exciting yeah oh they long-distance wasn't fun yeah I agree also I love your friendship with Jack I like I think it's always just mean so cute I feel like you guys would still do that today yes it's funny watching the blog itself it's so much slower no then what books are now yeah like it was literally just you just hit Kord and then you plop that in the timeline and then unless you messed up you cut that out but now once I could cut out dead space charlie like zoom in zoom out do funny stuff for graphics not you know it's plural it's changed a lot early is it's like trying to make it as entertaining an attention-grabbing yeah you know more so now than even back then where then there was just like you're just documenting stuff and just throwing it in oh my gosh 5:47 when I get to see Jess I'm not even complaining about waking up early I'm gonna shower and head over to the airport together beautiful day clear skies and my first order of business is obviously not get Jess I was clearly like I'm gonna vlog everything I'm a blogger now because I'm like documenting like it's gonna be like copy I know if it it's so cute you were doing so well I just like cringe at old videos like clearly I'm gonna probably look back at this in like you know three or four years and I cringe at myself again but the thing is I don't cringe at you like you're not fun I'm like oh my gosh he's so cute I just don't like looking at videos of me like way back when like I don't mind looking back at like recent stuff because I feel like I'm still like the same person you know but like looking back years it's like I feel like I've changed that scares me every time the AC will turn on and then I like AC when will it push the door closed so typically when Jess comes here it takes her forever to get through customs and stuff like that so I'm normally waiting at the airport for like a long time before she gets out so I was like Oh leave a little later this time yeah Gabriel you know a little after she lands okay around for such a long time yeah I leave a little later traffic gets worse okay what are you doing vlogging and driving you idiot we would not drive well we would it but we sit it out like we don't hold it like when vine was a thing I feel like half of the vines post it on vine where people driving and finding in their car and then that happened with snapchat everyone would just snap trying to talk to their camera when they drove it's dangerous guys we do not in what Len Dawson yeah I'm gonna be late to pick up my girlfriend that's that's weird to hear boyfriend sometimes I still call him boyfriend yeah sure I'm getting kind of fun actually oh he's not a hood I'm sorry guys I'm not at school right now he joined the teens love you Jess if I'm late to pick you up I'm such a semi-public wasn't sure if I want to make a joke or not you could see my thought process was like a tribe you funny but clearly this isn't funny I laugh at myself as if I was funny to convince the audience I was funny I think it's all about I just want to see my girlfriend I just want to get Jess that's all I want to do right now you're cute there is no I know I know I know I'm like it's whatever like I get it I'm like I get it it's a kind of cringe or anything huh it's like it's like half cringe where I don't know if I should just sit here watch it or whatever question make fun of myself you know what I mean so I'm like in this weird state of mind currently right now watching this being like did you did you know what you were doing you kind of did but also like you're kind of a loser I was running late traffic whatever and she's like oh no it's fine I'm not even out yet so I was like Frick yeah I made it on time yeah I made it on time and officially not a screw-up of a boyfriend yeah so if I can cross the street then I think we're good bro oh maybe you were just making sure that we had enough content for a video I don't know yeah because it ends like you know what I mean I got to pick you up it's like okay we're together that's the whole blog yeah I think you're doing a good job yes I think is here somewhere where she where is she she said she's hanging up the ring my feeling was it feels like it's exposed correctly it didn't focus that's it and I think Joey's a girl he began Busby's get miss trick we shut the cameras off because we thought it would it was awkward filming ourselves I didn't know while they're hugging each other it's funny though we filmed way more intimate moments back then than we do now I feel like I got to a point where we were like and you know like not document everything yeah it definitely needs to be a separation between yeah what is on camera and off camera but alcohol year dating and being engaged and getting married that was like such a hectic it'll be like film the whole thing we were filming all the time like almost every day we were like filming stuff yeah our relationship and everything which like raising was pretty hectic it's definitely important to have proxy still yeah interesting I'm glad we have these to look back on though like I'm glad we did film a lot can they have a lot to cream Jack Oh freaking we just waiting to say that I remember what I used to like airplane food you talk to so much slower well I know we're in public yes I would have been really Oakland vlogging you were jet-lagged and I think I just needs to talk I don't know like I'm it's awkward maybe I'm just so much more used to talking on camera now than I almost like speaking I think now I'm just a lot more comfortable like we've been doing this week he is now so I I'm fine talking to a camera now but I think back then it was just saying to me that I was probably I don't I'm thinking about everywhere that I was saying you're so happy and excited though it's so cute you're like so smiley didn't get stopped by customs this kind of us last time she came come what happened last time I came   I got stopped by customs I was just you didn't know how to handle my jokes you are at least normal here I'm like really old but I was me I was me too it dies all right I was really new to it now I know how to yeah yeah I totally agree now I know how to shut down his jokes how to control the vlog when I need to this was like the OL thing like you with a youtuber and I was learning everything from you know trained people sometimes there's nothing did you like my joke was that a funny joke clearly I said you need to train people sometimes you know good yeah it was that funny is that so hilarious yeah really funny I know I've never done that before filming when we saw each other I didn't think my clip is usable I didn't know what to say because I really did think for a long time that like I didn't know what to do when we were logging and I was just following what you were doing you were kind of not like in control of it but I you kind of like what like you let it because I was sorry me to it and so I still I see that I'm like gosh I was like nervous welcome to our vlog channel everybody Mugen I think you think it's just I'm Gabriel this is that couple it's just real why did we even think that was funny I feel like our humor has gotten better over the years thankfully I think like you make fun of my jokes every now and then but like I can land some sometimes that's objective clearly I'm objectively speaking but I feel like I'm a little funny do you think so well I think you've always been

to you because we've said before we're really enjoying these like sitting down challenging whatever they sit down we at the top and just try and make a funny joke Oh what have you guys had BuzzFeed quizzes so that's what we're gonna do today Gabe has found this article that's called sorry but if these 18 quizzes don't fix your love life nothing will so clearly we know that BuzzFeed knows it has all the answers to our love life more than us oh yes they clearly more know more than we do about love and relationships they're the problems they have a quizzes so we thought it would just be a good idea to sit down and test the boundaries of our relationship and see if we're truly meant for each other so we start here an article by BuzzFeed saying that if these 18 quizzes no fiction love life nothing well which I take strong offense to as a Christian because Jesus will fix   sorry I think we're just going to scroll through the list pick out a few we kind of roughly scrolled through it before clicking play but number two look is very interesting take this quiz to find out if you've already met the love of your life now if you're new here to this channel we're married so we think we meant to love our life we know it but according to BuzzFeed we don't know yet because we haven't taken a quiz I mean we're going on four years this year they say yeah you hurt for your marriage should we just fill up the front of this thing in Japan I guess yeah sorry trees taking it you me oh okay how about you take it I take this one you take the next on the show okay alright here we go isn't it great you're excited to see there is a I'm excited to see if I truly met the love of my life because I've been asking myself this question in thinking that I had clearly I'm married and I've been waiting for someone who is clearly qualified to let me know and confirm my suspicions of having met the love of Allah and BuzzFeed is really the best place it's the best place to know all the answers about anything really but especially love and relationships how long did your previous relationship last currently in a relationship just pick the option closest to how long you've been together Oh so the one that I'm in currently okay several years is the answer for this one pick a flavor of ice cream not sure how this is relevant oh it's very relevant this would be relevant if we were both taking the quiz and then I was comparing the GNC that would be a compatibility quiz which one are you gonna pick strawberry no really out of all the things I'd probably pick chocolate vanilla what's some chocolate like during taste very good I'm more of a cookie dough cookies and cream yeah yeah I would pick that too but like out of these places probably money it's your strawberry I'm licking it a strawberry look it's blue I clicked it how many serious partners have you had in your life 1 2 3 I really just crushed in these quizzes it's like one serious question of what what's going on and then one like random you know absolutely nothing to take how long is your relationship problems my screen how many partners have you had how about a dolphin now pick a dolphin don't ask why just pick it I like this one cuz this guy right here looks like he it's like he's humble he's humble but he's also like mysterious he knows he knows something that you don't like look at that summer and he's just like chilling just like why didn't you know like just say through the water just like knowing that there's a shark gonna eat you and he's like watch me I'm gonna be but he's waiting for the shark to come and he knows the humble rescue yeah also this one's cool he looks like Milo waiting for a toy yes this dolphin here looks like there are also do you see that way bro I'm debating between these two I don't think this question is that serious I'm gonna go with my gut which was my first instinct love is what makes the world go round that's gonna be blurred love is sacrifice love is the most beautiful thing or love is patient love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it does not it is enough now he's not self-serving he keeps no record of wrong I think I butchered this never fails get the hoodie contemplating calm it's their baby this wasn't even meant to be a plug but we didn't it anyways the most beautiful thing which may be always hugs your heartstrings these are all four of your favorite movies yep I want to say I've seen Love Actually probably in passing haven't seen Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind Titanic yes and no I've seen in like little bit chunks because the new team and when I was younger I saw it in chunks because of the Nerds because I was the only senior born one so that's not that's not what I'm saying I was home-schooled and a lot of you guys are really getting upset that I keep saying that I'm homeschooled but I'm gonna keep saying in every video there's just a lot of things that wasn't allowed to watch got seen denuded he being one of them so it was like okay also I'm not like a romantic movie John what kind of gotten but the notebook it's just a classic ah no but Titanic is really like it's more soo yeah I'm going to attack what do you believe in most our destiny science for all they book you haven't met them I'm 80 I need to speak to whoever write this yes listen there's some silver lining but it's not all bad news there are still plenty of other great people out there waiting to me it so apparently I'm not in love I haven't met the love of my life and I'm not happy according to this you aren't telling something you may notice what's the name of the person online this article Louis Louis Louis you'll be getting Lewis again about a minute I think I need to take the same quiz you're gonna retake it I think so okay retake the battery to do it much faster how long did your previous relationship last several years hey can I say no to you've already answered them what serious pot is one two three pick a dolphin my money love

do one one more okay we'll get will squeeze one more we can't predict when you'll get married with 95% accuracy this is fake but I'll try okay when we'll get married we're over three years in and

long was your longest relationship three to five pick a dream honey magnet location mmm Tuscany looks great so does to Haiti I know and this is kind of similar to what we did we could finally travel and we went to Fiji okay I'll do that okay do you believe in life have to love what does that even mean life after love obviously it means the person was in a relationship that was loving and very meaningful and that relationship ends in this lesson does excuse me oh my gosh Wow so it's when a relationship ends and that person doesn't think they can survive life without be able person so I guess it depends who it is because for the most part yeah but people just keep on living you know not to do yeah she's a celebrity maid of honor and best man GOI oh wow Chris Pratt Selena Gomez I probably have to pick Selena Gomez and Chris Pratt lost yeah we have a little bit of heart you do this really quickly and see what you get are you in a relationship yes what kind of cake what kind of pet do you have or want a dog can I just say there's only six options in these quizzes what if someone wanted to make a miniature horse you know I'm saying how could they have 365 days and like differ

how long was your longest relation relation us good dog I just wanted you to know pick a dream honeymoon location we did go here don't pick that but I'm gonna go with this yeah that's really cool do

without something wrong wedding date however in the alternate universe where we would have picked a different wedding day that could have been it yeah so I guess BuzzFeed has confirmed our love after all that is so fun technically not but we just like making ourselves think that it's okay no we're not it is okay we BuzzFeed confirmed it for us okay I feel like I could keep doing these but we've already done so many and I feel like we need to end on that good night love you guys thank you so much for watching and if you've made it this far per usual just give yourself a nice big round of applause and smash the like button and smash the bell and smash the comment section and smash them I don't know thank you guys for watching I love you guys hope you enjoyed we'll see you next time peace out from Jess gabriel conte  I'm sweating today another vlog another bake another Kunti kitchen conversation context kitchen conversations some new segments guys is it I don't know if this video gets 10 billion lights and maybe we'll start this new segment so due to popular demand we are going to be doing asking your husband / boyfriend questions that girls are too afraid to ask I did a version of this on my channel if you haven't seen it I gonna link it so we did a few questions I've run there as like a little section of my video and everyone was like please do a full version of this so we're back in the kitchen we're actually going to be making banana bread / banana muffins which is why Gabe is episode kindly greasing the muffin tray I asked you guys on Instagram and I like picked out a few that I'm going to ask yes and you just have to give your opinion on it so I'm going to be asking Gabe's as this gays opinion but he can't answer on behalf of it every single male yes I can't because all guys are exactly the same you said not in my video I realized as I was coming out of my mouth I was like well I heard that joke guys listen I'm giving opinions on this video so if you don't like it like if your opinion is different to his opinion that's fine that's fine you know here's something my dad used to said opinions opinions are like buttholes everybody has one classic classic classic dad proverb so we're going to get into baking but this isn't like a tutorial so going to kind of like do this as IOC question yes sounds good oh so all of these are anonymous just because we wanted you guys to ask like whatever you wanted to say you're leaving us hanging and babe I want to hear the juicy Q's session number one yes do you boys get butterflies and giddy about girls it depends like if you're talking about you with one direction back in the day you probably got butterflies in Gibby I didn't have life-size cutout posters of every single member in one direction in my bedroom fast yeah at all I did I feel like it's more common in girls you could just get butterflies by their crush or their celebrity crush or things of that sort you mean does that make sense I see you don't get better class I do get butterflies when it actually means something meaningful but like I get to see Jess after being apart for six weeks when we were doing long-distance I have butterflies you know I was thinking you know from the airport and we reacted to our first vlog when I did that watch it it's a good one those are moments that I feel like that's a guy how I get butterflies for a woman I feel like there's a lot more scenarios where you would get butterflies other than just that scenario you know what I mean like what like when you were screaming out of an because the Harry Styles and when you're 15 years old you probably had butterflies as I was driving that's different though that's like a different kind of but life it's still nervous no not really feeling right I'm just saying that's the one time I can recall for myself that I would get butterflies is about me right no no not that one the singular moments of those moments were about you specifically do you remember the night that you asked to hold my hands oh yeah yeah yeah and then when I kissed you for the first time oh girl can you just crush that a little bit who got oh it's Christmas you guys feel stuff move around when they run like your balls is that pushy yes and no you do it would be super open right now I don't know if this for every guy with this something i like notice things that happen so there's a few scenarios here right where your boxers are a non fully supportive piece of fabric at the beginning it's like you know happening but i think as time goes on in like a sporting event i used to do sports me look it like in a sporting scenario and i don't know if it's just me but your body has like this natural reaction of like lightening things all compress it sounds super weird I'm not talking about like you just like shrink or anything things that get pulled up a little bit and it like tightens up to support yourself that's just my experience with me observing the science in anatomy of my own body the thing is the thing is when I go for a run I like to wear compression shorts underneath yes which keeps things tight it's like a sports bra an extra layer of just you know protecting the goods that is my very open scientific clearly proven observation of when males run in when they have penis okay next question is what's the cutest piece of clothing gonna go I've had actually a lot of people ask that yeah what an example of someone else said beside is there a guy version of how a girl likes gray sweatpants on guys thanks for our pants shorts today so Israeli like an item of clothing that you like oh my gosh thank you for me specifically when you wear an oversized t-shirt yes that means sweater you would have done this on oh girl oh girl hold me that I love when your hair's like it it is right now I wanted to pull back because I get to see like your beautiful neck and your jawline that's intimidating and you know it's always like the one in like the shape of your face and stuff like if your hair is covering a lot of it I just prefer it like this I'll throw this on you hold me back now if you're wearing the baggy sweatshirt the baggy 30 you could be wearing leggings or you know just like normal shorts underneath no whatever like that doesn't matter it's a sweater I don't want that and the oversized t-shirt that's really interesting dude I'm telling you make a banana bread girl because you were straight smash dude disgusting that literally looks like a turd almond butter or peanut butter peanut butter um look at what really really controversial when I parted there Reese's things pretty low like that was super professional well listen listen it's 50/50 right here but on YouTube you can you pulse and there's RuPaul yeah I'm gonna almond butter this is such a weird question like no no I feel like I'm no obvious I know what like certain guys are attracted to certain things more or less you know what I mean so like I'm trying to answer this generically for like oh you've heard it before it's exercise are like but guys and boob guys or whatever but like I don't think I have like personally that much preference I'm more attracted to your face okay does that make sense I'm looking at your face and make it out with your face Wow before next question okay was that was that honest I guess I don't thing that helps because everyone's did everyone every guy's name yeah and be honest I'm just being real some guys are just a little bit more douchey than others and it's just the fact you know and I didn't want to say it I didn't well I get tall as when talking about dating these guys I really think about I don't know what that would guess like it depends on the guy there's a large majority of guy especially when you're young hormones are just popping you know what I mean this could be totally kind of hurtful like do you think there would be a difference of if you met a guy when you're at the club late at night or if you're at church but what I'm saying is like you know got like those are two of the extreme like for examples but it depends like where are you looking are you giving yourself to a guy before you should because that's something that you have to like make sure that you set boundaries in your relationship to know that you guys are like for the right reasons that's right waiting for marriage it's like because we set up the boundaries and you know that all the boxes are checked everything is good with the other person before we bring in the physical into it let me bring the physical into it that's like such an emotionally strong connection and things happen with chemicals in your brain and all the science cuz obviously I'm qualified to talk so these are up top these are juicy I know he's maybe think is it possible to just to be best friends with a girl this one is you can do a whole pop in my personal opinion I think you're gonna be really good friends with him but mmm I don't think like your best friend every day yeah because I've seen people that just say they're best friends I know and like when I was in high school I had guys that I would consider best friends I think is the best way to say is I was always a good mindset that when I was single I wanted to practice the way I wanted to act in a marriage relationship so I knew that when I found the person that she could trust me because I was already acting the way she would want me to have even when I was single so with that said they thought was best friends with a girl who wasn't just and were married and I'm to hang out with another girl I got something that's no that's not you know what I mean it really depends what the motivation is yes but whether you aware of it or not you're always practicing something your habits are being developed at every point in life what you did yesterday the day before for the past year what you're going to be doing for the next year of your life you're always practicing your habits that will dictate the way you continue to act in the future I think you guys know we're out of time so that's my answer in my opinion my personal experience my opinion and why I don't have girls best friends guys always noticing other girls     there's no probably entering from like a very Christian perspective like yes and no I would say the natural instinct of a guy is dealing with that sort of thing you know what I mean for myself and a marriage relationship it's like no no I need to only have eyes for Jess it's like the same where you practice the way you practice is what you get good at so I need to constantly practice like not looking at other girls and not looking at things whatever it is you know what I mean like whether it's on your phone or when we're out or whatever I need to like practice making sure that I only have eyes for just make sure that she knows that she can trust me and that I'm putting in the effort to make sure that our marriage is the best so that she can trust me it's definitely just unnatural like instinct and like from a Christian perspective that's sin and lust and that sort of thing and I know that a lot of people especially in today's day and age will have a totally different opinion who makes that it's a weird one and I think some guys that's not that priority like that's my opinion for me it's wrong for me to look at other women and that's what everyone's different is them Marla's video is this video controversial this is the same thing as kind of a dude he's like I'm sweating these questions are getting you like nervous yeah okay Amy oh okay this one is not SD doesn't flirt when in the phone / in the BA that was a very highly commented a lot of people one of them I didn't even know if it's me I played I just need it this is helping in the pool you're swimming you're moving it's not something it's kind of like if I'm going this way you know it trails along and then if I'm going I jump off the trails down or if I jump in you know but I have noticed in the bath it wasn't something that I like purposely notice but I heard I think there's in a Ricky Gervais sinner he talked about how already gets the Saghir you notice that my foots in the back but they float I thought it was very funny a little gross a pretty hilarious I decided the next time I just wanted to me to observe let the record show that the answer is yes not a pointing thing weren't like floats you know it's like the level of buoyancy I think it's different it's different it sound like it floats all the way and it like it wasn't connected it would just float to the top you know there's those things that you see like made me feel ugly oh sure and cool or something where it doesn't just top it it kind of just like hangs around it has floats around I think that's a lot of points you talk about here thank you thank you yes can you really not stop the stream you can't you can in a very particular situation most of the time it's pointless and it's very uncomfortable to stop really yes when you're paying but it is possible for instance maybe back in the day I was hanging out with one of my buddies at their house I have to go pee I forget to lock the door they bust in the room trying to just like mess with you and then all of a sudden everything just you know tightens up and you're in defense mode and you're able to stop at them but it's like a very rare situation you know what I mean okay we're like the bathroom or something and something happened it was justice just in the kitchen that sounded horrible and he and her scream or something I can like you know defense mode stop myself okay pull myself together get out there and say that what I'm trying to say is a real hero can stop the street it's a learned superpower the next one I don't fully understand but it was actually requested why do you guys like one so much and I'm doing that guy's quite a lot of people said that I don't know I honestly don't know he did a Q&A once and you said that you prefer and as appointment and I was like great yeah my opinion on that has change because it like depends on the person I don't know I thought that was kind of random yeah I mean that is a stereotype yeah weird answer that one do you men get nervous about that first first time bacon banana yeah I'm nervous for our first time yeah I'm like a little bit I wasn't nervous in the sense that like oh she's gonna judge me for my performance because like we were so on the same page you're getting married like it didn't yeah what do you all do at sleeper this was like weird we were into video games I'd try to point to may play certain video games I call of duty and stuff we were into making videos that we put on like Facebook and stuff so we go hang out pull out like a really crappy digital camera that couldn't record line that baby up and hit record and 480p we're ready to make the muffins everybody yes good job

correct are you trying to make me lose no you're trying to make me question things you're like well how long do you think I live there that wasn't the question I got it right and then you're like are you are you sure try to make me change it try maybe lose you see that no I'm just I want to know yeah there's two first towns and I lived in a pretty equal but one but just so guys got this Jess at the beginning of this came up with a question that she didn't know they thought it was so good and should I realized I didn't you know how this works what was the question I had to text my family I don't want to say yet in case it's similar to one that you have okay wait till the end yeah we'll save it today yeah to me to you right now I'm two for two baby what was my first instrument piano are you sure yeah really good I took lessons for a year when I was six years old yeah I remember that and then he went to drums my thing for a long time I need a said we're just stuff it's like we've been married for over three years or something name the Horta in which I met my best friends my four best friends you meant Jess first and Jane and Sarah were they're kind of a package deal you know then Jane then Sarah then flora I'm not looking at your phone I was looking in that general direction it's my thinking you know I like okay give me a final answer Jess when you were like two or something Jane Sarah and then Farah when you meant to Brisbane correct I met Jane 1 year before I met Sarah Jane you're doing really well so class three four three baby let's go what years did I attend real school this and second yeah oh yeah oh here has been my favorite band slash person to see live and comes it and how many times have I seen them live your mid far away talent you to come closer it's my thinking I need no Adele oh no no no hmm did you see that your life we've talked about what concerts have gone to I know but I kind of turn it out because it's just like boy bands most of fun I'm gonna go Ed Sheeran twice over the del cuz I haven't eaten alive your boy is on fire your boy he's on fire dude filling his coffee fire if you haven't seen entering life he's like the most humble sweet honest lighting comes in and so talented Bobby he's got something of coffee yeah yeah okay you just like a little bit it's a little dot speak maybe it's just little trips you just rub it out and then it dries up no I see what you did there yeah how many years did I have attend the college that's interesting is that interesting I think you attended college for two years in turtle one year at FAU doing your thing that the Americans have to do throw it around on one and then one year at FSU doing happening it's correct isn't it yeah what is it called that you have to be going Jenna's in general education general ed it's like doing high school again yeah yeah I didn't either notes about anything wrong no we're on fire it is 44 in a heated match in history class how many schools did I go to you and but how many times did I move schools so you would have gone to one and Kingaroy then he would have gone to the one in Towanda then you would have gone to the one in Brisbane including college or university yeah just ask I want to say four because I think there may have been one into Wamba that you switched and then you went back to the school again they originally went to so four separate schools again like an extra verse the second one second to the third one third back to the second one wait I don't even know you're at one school you moved once you moved again then back that's three then your final move to school that you graduated so it's four different schools four moves because if you didn't move it would have been to moves this is so this is you should have just taken the move out didn't what was my explanation correct so what's your final answer how many schools did I go to for and I moved four times sure I don't know it depends how you measure the move was it four schools correct law schools I went one two three two three four what yep yeah yep I did that yeah yeah when I moved to my head school I only went there for half a semester Tim and then I moved back and then I moved back again it was confusing because we're all brilliant wow you got one girl go home name all of the sports that I played in high school I liked professionally you mean not just like it now I'm going over my friend's house in like yeah yeah like competitive professional competitive me you played competitive basketball you loved it but then you had to move to wrestling shoes my friends finally thing you just say fine we just had final answer dad a true that I like falling on my head mmm-hmm I'm not actually sure he did a bit of football two to one I only wrestled in high school oh you didn't I played basketball in elementary school oh that's so rude and I played soccer at like in kindergarten I guess I wasn't listening to the crushing problem I wrestle the whole time yeah cuz I think I was just thinking in school this is what you did not attend high school I know well dang dang it but that's all because I know you so well that I went above and beyond do you noticing guys I know him sorry well if you knew me so well you would have been getting that question right I can you know I still haven't cut a question out so I might just add one in the end for the leg okay for a little ol fancy schmancy well was I wearing the day we met they're out for Hamzah's black leggings under your black skirt and you had like black shoes that were like slip ons you had green shirt overtime you know it's weird I feel like I've gotten this question right and another like you and I or something yeah I think you have now just I was like I feel like breathing on that's that's for things yeah remind me black leggings mm-hmm which you mean stockings right stockings yes oh yeah cuz they went around your feet yes yeah black flats flats a black skin yes and a green sweater that one is a tank top but then I took you to church smells like white no you wouldn't have worn but you you may have wow I'm so bad at this because I for sure answered it right in another vlog like a year or so ago great tape right green sweater both it wasn't green beige no it's Mary the maroon one Miss Mary Nordic but that was really good don't it I'd give you half a point cuz you got everything else what instruments did I play in my church's worship in gosh that's a good question I'm gonna say you just played the drums or maybe you play guitar as well there you got it I know you played the drums yep the drums you play the drums correct and I also played the congas because my dad always wanted me to play the Condors it's like half a point we tied at four and a half points I'd like to thank everyone for participating in this momentous occasion this history pop quiz I think we know each other pretty well I think we do I think we do I think we do good working with you yeah this was fun let's do it again never mind thank you so what was your extra question plus extra question that you didn't know my extra question was how many times do I get detention in high school I say once yeah just for the record it wasn't my fault that's what they all say no seriously that's what they all say reject and someone in the group didn't finish the project in time so we all had to stay behind and guess he left early the girl we didn't know you told me that it's like a bacteria stay on that well I got my ring she's watching this and she's like she's still salty about that no I didn't want to know her the question that I was just cracking up that what the one that you didn't know yes I was gonna ask you how many cards have I lived in including apartments what died and I literally couldn't figure it out in Toowoomba I moved around so much oh that's funny I had to text my family we'll all try to figure it out we didn't even I forgot the house or two it was really funny that's that's actually really decided to cut it out that's so difficult I would have had no way I would have known that I know that's the point like if I said that to you what do you know how many island including dorm rooms yes sure I'm gonna say a Oh nine ten well you know past fourteen fourteen you moved round yeah alright guys thank you for watching that was fun was it you enjoy it yeah you always like taking a good old trip down memory lane I do I'm a big fan and your fan of learning history I am hey it's okay yeah sorry thank you for the lesson you're welcome thank you for tuning in to I was in class same time same place next week yeah um I'll leave that up car you down below for the next one see you on Saturday it's pretty good my guys see on Saturday that's good I like that i made an oopsy i made nope see   another day another vlog look at we're not sitting in that corner anymore we didn't do this what not a sit-down video not a saturday sit down no it's a saturday shlog that's funny it would have been a slog not a slug all right do you want to explain what's going on today what's happening what's going on right now yeah i'll show you what are we doing he's actually really excited right now basically i started combing milo out just to make sure get him to start getting ready you know before the vlog just a little bit do a little coming gotta do a little bit more later but uh we're gonna try and give him a haircut today he's just so like hairy not harry but just like you know he's overdue for a haircut very overview but we can't go anywhere to get a haircut because things are so close but things are starting to open a tiny bit for pick-up yes so maybe we'd be able to get him a haircut in the next week or so but we already had this idea and we're like you know what let's just go for it and if it sucks then we can fix it and run away yourself and it's exciting because we ordered it we ordered the tools from a place do you want to know what place it is well you have to keep watching a lot of you already know what we're talking about very nice you already know we need to go pick it up pick up the tools it'll be nice to get i say get some fresh air but we'll be in the car get some drive out of this these the four walls yes it's interesting because there's a bit more full walls yeah but four walls makes a picture of your clothes on every side so science whatever let's go okay what's up guys welcome back we're on the road again okay you're trash that was funny wow something smells like funny do you want are we finished yeah smelly cat smelly cat how does it go scaredy cat that's the other one that's funny oh i get it i can't see the other half the billboard from where i'm sitting funny you know what else is funny if we got copyright claimed and demonetized for me singing smelly cat no that'd be hilarious we weren't we made it the moment you've all been waiting for the reveal you might be able to tell from in my glasses right now of what that is you can where are we talking so we ordered some stuff online that you can pick up right outside or something like that or they bring it to your car i don't know we gotta figure that out so we're not actually like going in and hanging out as much as i like can't wait for the day that we can go hang out and target again we are uh just doing a quick pick up doing the distancing thing so gabe's gonna go in put on a lovely thank you man ma bam bam thank you ma'am i'll be back see you in a jiffy i was going to say sack it rhymes with back but sec is what i meant so that didn't land i'll be back see you see you in a sec i'll be back see you in a sec that works if you throw in an accent okay this is pointless i'm going in we back out here guys we out here i'm gonna drive and we'll show you the difference between order pickup and going into target is it was really long we drove through here when was it like a weekend or two ago yeah and it was so long anyway it's pretty wild so we got the goods so you know we're giving milo a cut today it's gonna be the first time that we have ever given him a cut i thought we should probably um entice him with whoa this is way bigger than i've got a fun toy this is hilarious this whole thing i thought it was going to be like this big that's hilarious like just a little thing you could throw around so that's our little like way to get him liking us and then this is our our trimmer our dog dog trimmer con air all right gabe has watched a youtube video by the way if you didn't see him what cut my hair he did i cut jess's hair really recently he watched youtube video for that now you're doing your dogs i'm not very much looking forward to doing this because i feel like i'm going to get annoyed because i would obviously want to be done right but i don't feel that oh no my skill level go for it yeah wait let me see this did you get a kit or anything or is this just a one size this is just a trimmer he's going to be buzzed we need a clip it has like the smallest little clip no because i watched the video and i'll show you i'll show you the video of the product we'll see we'll see what happens all right guys this is the order pickup line except when i went there was no one in the line okay so basically no line so nothing and then this is the line to get into target oh my gosh it is so long actually this is shorter than it's shorter than it was the other day but still sheesh wild i made an oopsy i made no see we were just talking about the trimmer situation yeah when i said oh this looks like it's gonna buzz him and i was so confident i said no no no there's a video on the target website that i watched let me show you so i pulled it up we were listening to it and right in the beginning it's like this is perfect for trimming the paws ears sanitary area areas and i was like oh like in the video i watched the parts where she said to use the scissors or like a really short blade to just cut it all off but then jess realized after that was that she completely skipped through the video yeah just to see what the dog looked like i skipped to like the middle to the end part where she was actually like trimming the dog and now that i think about it she did only show like the pause but then the end result the dog was like perfectly trimmed and i was like perfect this is all i need now we can't do it yeah we can with what babe i think there's going to be curbside pickup for a pet store we could order one really quick okay all right on the way home we're gonna have to figure this out right now and try and make this happen guys i made a mistake oh you made an oopsy i was pretty excited for this vlog i was like vlogging we're gonna go to target now look at us closers are out of stock everywhere from dogs we could drive like over more into la and get one but it's already four pm and that would make it so late so we're trying to figure it out i ruined everything no you didn't ruin everything i ruined everything okay yeah you ruined it now we need to figure out something else to do in the vlog i mean the vlog's like half done anyway but you know we gotta figure it out because we were gonna cut his hair we left you guys hanging that's what we thought this vlog was gonna be we're gonna go home and figure it out we'll check in with you guys in a second literally for you guys it'll be one second like right now oh crazy pretty fancy up here all right guys r.i.p oh gosh yeah so that's what i was going to talk about this is the issue with with vlogging you know we used to vlog and like we would have nothing planned and we just vlogged a day and it was fine it's fine but the youtube landscape has changed where you kind of have to know what your title is going to be before you start filming not always like sometimes we'll just vlog and something will happen or like we'll vlog knowing that like this is kind of going to be how our day looks like or like we'll talk about this but it's not always like super super planned well no what i'm saying is you need to kind of have a rough idea of what you'd be able to title the video they're just being super honest with you guys like normal videos if you're just like doing a normal uh video of some sort you know you're going to title it but a vlog specifically you need to kind of have some sort of idea of what's going to make people want to click on it that's the truth there's so much content on youtube now that you have to like yes kind of just strategize a little bit more than you used to have to this was going to be our video that's what we're saying this it was going to be us trying to cut our dog's hair and now that's not happening what's up dude hi everybody so now we're in this point where we're like halfway through this vlog and i mean we can keep vlogging some stuff but it's just like it's clearly not a haircutting video yeah listen we ran out of banana bread i wonder why i'm just talking about what i'm saying is we could bake more lol we baked banana bread like two vlogs again i know but it's fine we can do it again should i give milo yeah let's do that no let's do that let's do that let's do that my we have a gift for you well it was gonna be like a bribe but now it's out of the goodness of our heart oh no way dude i know it's crazy oh my gosh okay you need to sit are you so excited are you ready down yeah all the way down oh my goodness oh my gosh oh yeah it makes you want to just stand up for a while huh do you like it is that fun look we can play like this oh yeah you like it he's got to get used to it and then he's going to love it yeah all right mine good job we figured it out guys oh my gosh come on guys remember that pan from a few videos ago we're making the banana bread muffin things again wait no no that's not what we're doing we didn't actually just just decided to make them because we ran out today but we decided that we'd give you guys a few updates on some of the things that's going on i know we actually do have some big updates five specific updates we'll go through the moving ones first oh what sorry i don't mean to interrupt you i'm just so excited i want to show them everything oh it's it's not time yes i know but as this whole staying inside social distancing thing has been going on a lot of time has elapsed over 50 days of saying for us almost two months yes we realized it feels like nothing has happened like time has gone on and months have gone by weeks and months have gone by but it feels like we've just stayed still it's been just a still like nothing has happened until we i guess things go back to normal or whatever but actually we realized that this time in two months we'll be packing well we might within a month like around junish we might start the process of like packing non-essential things that we can just start getting in boxes now i know we have so much stuff to go through we're not actually bringing a lot of this stuff yeah so that's happening second thing number two we've actually bought we don't have it yet but we purchased online our first piece of furniture which was so bizarre very weird it made it all real like oh yeah this is happening soon but there's like a long like lead time with that sort of thing so we made sure that we purchased it with the amount of weeks that's necessary for the delivery anyway whatever it happened though yes and that was really exciting it was a couch guys it was a couch it was a couch it was a couch they really don't care like we're so excited number three work projects this week was like the week of things starting to surface again and like conversations starting to start up again of like oh maybe we should start getting these things going or like hey the future's looking pretty decent that things may start opening up in the near future so we can i don't know whatever needless to say projects are starting to resurface and those conversations are starting to happen again and it's feeling really good because i feel like i need to stop playing as much video games and be a little bit more productive i mean i feel like everyone through this has like gone through periods of just feeling so unproductive and so to finally hear news that things that we had planned for this year like we're going to start up again we were kind of like oh almost like an instant boost of we can be productive like just some hope where it's like oh i thought that was just like not gonna happen yeah for i don't know i feel like we all kind of are getting used to like what this is like and everything going on that makes normality kind of kind of feel like not real yeah i get that this is going a little tangent but it was kind of like how when it was so many years of not being able to go back to australia even though australia was there and that was reality for so long for you and for me visiting you there and everything since you weren't able to visit for so long it seemed like such a distant like dream or fantasy of like oh maybe one day we'll go there but it's not going to happen so you're right great analogy because that's exactly how it feels it feels just like that yeah the separation like mentally like separates you from being separated is a separation just separates you mentally in the mental separation of each separated part of the of the equation yeah i think it's getting a bit wordy but i do understand you get what i'm saying yeah so we'll move on now is what you're trying to say yeah things are going to start happening again which is exciting yeah also i think the fact that la finally got news of like some certain stores can start opening the pick up again that was hope for us yeah it's a phase two thing i'm pretty sure is that all your updates that you're going to share no that was face too i said all your updates yeah all five i don't remember the other two well one's sitting right over there oh yeah guys the puzzle's coming along the new puzzle this is really isn't an update but i know we just update you guys on our puzzles yeah some people are really invested into this and a lot of you guys are like actually buying puzzles now and doing them because you saw us doing them which is cool but yeah not that many pieces left we have a few pockets here to fill but things are going well there and then the last thing oh the last thing the last thing the last thing we get it you're homeschooled that's such a meme now is it a meme for like our audience we'll like wait for you to say it have you said it in this one i haven't said it in this vlog but if you guys have not sponsored me it should be a meme like no no no but like actually there should be a certain picture of me you know what i mean like a meme is like a specific photo that turns into a meme and this could be the but it's okay i was homeschooled so i could be like blah blah blah blah blah blah but it's okay i was homeschooled what should be just like you know what i mean you can do like really interesting faces do my half eye thing give me a sec while i figure this out all right guys sorry it took a second but we figured it out take a screenshot of the picture that's going to show up on the screen right now and make a meme out of it where at the bottom it says but it's okay i was homeschooled yeah yeah good photo huh you liked it i know anyway fifth thing it's not my fifth thing all right guys the fifth thing it's just another update no like news news but how much have you said about this i haven't shared a lot about it remember the board game that i was making with jess's dad it's still in the works guys we're working on getting all the pieces to the puzzle it's not a puzzle the game that's funny though but yeah it's definitely becoming a real thing yeah working with people to make it a possibility but the process takes so long to make it like happen it's been happening since like january when we got back yeah to the us we've been working on it and it's been developing designing and stuff is like a lot yeah but it's been being developed behind the scenes and hopefully we'll have you know some updates and stuff to share soon but in the meantime that's just what's happening right now isn't it exciting it is very exciting i think that's so cool yeah i'm very that's one of the coolest things that you're working on i think well well well i mean to be honest everything i'm working on is like the bomb.com dude so i didn't realize how creatively fulfilling it was it was definitely one of the most creatively fulfilling things that i've like ever done which is pretty wild it's exciting it's fun and i i hope that we can share with you guys soon so although this vlog was very much a fail and it's all because of me no no not all only like 95 i'm really disappointed i'm kidding i would have loved to see us cut milo's hair i mean maybe or maybe he'll just grow his hair out like you are sorry that this was such a fail it's all good but hopefully it's still entertaining even though we were we opened up and we were like guys this is what happens we need to figure out a title for this video still i don't know what that's gonna be so hopefully we find something that makes people wanna watch please just in the comments give us some support for the title yeah whatever the title is just tell us that we did a good job at figuring supporting one out of the bag all right thank you guys so much for watching we love you guys and we'll see your beautiful faces in the next video love you guys so bad that's such a bad joke it's kind of fun love you guys we'll see you next time peace out from jess and gabriel do it for the world - I was like typical Gabe it was too quiet oh and that's the perfect opportunity I should have been like singing or something just a very well you have to hurry the other person oh well well come to this video on YouTube Broadway you Bradley yeah I was just kind of rolling with it but I was hilarious I was really kinda guys you should subscribe is how funny she was that was good yeah the people have spoken not really but we're assuming that this is what you want because the other one just took off sorry the video that i quiz Gabe on FEMA products that one did so well so many people have been like recreating mm-hmm and so many people have been asking us for a pot - or like the other way around where I quit her on mail products but there's not that many mail products especially that I wouldn't know I do have one actually this will be a one-time pre-quiz before we get into the actual video oh great yeah it is good all right this mini one question quiz usually get a hundred percent or a zero percent and you fail it's so easy you already know what it is but it's just funny this was the only thing I could really think of that's like truly a guy product okay what is that well you didn't like crop out oh crap what is that it's a OH oh my gosh no but it's okay I'm guessing it 2130 hmm I've never seen them before okay is that for when you're playing sports or is it for more than that that's only sports I just called a cup oh I think it can go into your compression shorts and it fits in and it basically protects your nether regions from when you're playing football and a guy tackles you and as me nails you in the crotch or things of the sort or doesn't it I haven't no okay I got balls of steel another day another vlog not appropriate what a problem is sorry anyway we've had a bunch of requests to do more of that video and we couldn't really figure out the best way to do it besides well with what we just did just know until this morning were on a nice walk through our neighborhood and would brainstorming video ideas and then we thought hold on let's get some products forgetting to actually see in real life touch review and test out we were like hold on some female vo thank you another female products video that sound Jenny okay Jenny get a bridge to me yeah where's the team I love how like we're trying to make jokes just for her like this isn't going in the video it's like just for Jay look ain't going on for a while by the way if you didn't know our editors name is Jenny and g-dragon nuts and I assume she likes tea and we weren't gonna leave that part in until it's really funny in our chart on my water and then we're like good comedy now you know everyone say hi to Jenny this clip has been going for eight minutes we got some products at Target we did what we did in the last video in a little special order drove pick it up which was amazing we social distance safe I didn't even go in the top I was heated I I did it but what's hilarious is that Jess did the same thing as last video I made no tea I made no say she messed up one of the orders again she messed up one of the worst again marry house just messy it was and how much of a fail I was you were in a fail yeah a little bit yeah okay but I have a reproduction inside that engaged in a great series yep test it out that's basically what this video is do you have anything to add before I just jump right into the target before we just Philip DeFranco it and just jump right into it I do not have anything sad I think people have been waiting long enough what would you like to start with the film yes so you remember in our video where it was like the donut looking saying the ears on your hair yes I totally thought I was wondering one of their turns out I didn't it's called a sophistic sophistic twist I get how you can totally think I know that that's what it was I was just looking this stuff like on our wall and I wasn't looking at it in great detail but it'll still make a bun so Janice this is new for us introducing these the perfect styles each to Chris new twist sophistic words with sophistic as you guys can see there's a lot of different options I think we're just gonna try the fun though right yes mmm this kind of doesn't make sense you want me to try it out on your hair yes people actually gonna calm yeah does anyone else when they getting the head done in a head so on it's like it whenever my sister braids my kid or something oh it's just like oh my gosh I think actually yes and I feel like this product is gonna fail that's what my gut tells me but my heart tells me to be positive and gently squeeze both sides of the sophistic twist because it's sophisticated slide to fistrick twist down until it is approximately two to four inches from the end of the head rolls of history twist in wood reaching the back of your head I wish I could see what was happening oh no you don't and I roll it all the way up right yep reaching the back of your head oh this is so bad yeah it doesn't feel very no oh this is horrible band sophistic twist downward to form a circle and overlap ends to secure it it in place oh well it kind of worked guys come on it kind of worked I'm pretty sure there's like totally friggin worked yeah I don't think it's really secure but look check this out oh wow it like work through the look of it but I feel like I can just like pull it out so easily yeah it feels really loose I'm that's right just us now guys just mean u-tube I was entertaining so much I said the funniest joke I know I could hear ya alright you ready for the next thing yes now I'm gonna give you an easy one yeah Oh a pad lovely perfect save it for later save for later when we're out yeah Jake's assertion is insane I'll have it here yeah ready in case of an emergency in case of an emergency for when one of us needs it me have you ever looked at one of these before I have seen a pad before he had yeah just basic plastic not come on why is this side sticky well where does that stick ah to your underwear so you put it in your underwear and then it mmm yeah like on your you know on the side yeah when you're like so I peel this off correct yeah oh so it never okay see I thought it was reverse I thought that they're sticky you stickiness was on the edges and I thought the stickiness was on this side as well so when you put it on it like that's what I thought it like stuck to your legs a little bit because it was like this and then this part you know like your leg is here and I thought it like just stuck on the side I thought you stuck it on your body now I'm realizing that it sticks to your underwear and where does the wing go it wraps underneath for support and control I understand now I get it I understand the science of it all it is also to the likeness of a sleep mask like such well it would be the other way around really if you put it like this you can stick it this is foolproof it doesn't have a blackout technology within you know that's not what it's not the purpose of it but it can definitely work it keeps your I suppose blocks out some light for sure next product gallon took an unexpected turn that I did not like I totally thought you fully knew how they work I understand now I'm enlightened my brain has been open taking a bit of a different ten yeah we are going to review this hair remover but it seems like I got a fancy one it lights up oh there's like that blade thing to remove any peach fuzz or whatever yeah but we're gonna do you one better I left a little scruff on just for the occasion so we can test it out to see if it truly works on a more substantial face of hair this aw that's pretty fancy that is so it is not how do the battery let's put it in I'm guessing we removed this somehow like that we just line that baby up yeah alright so I figured out how to take the blade off hmm well we can't go out you see that it's like wow oh stop Oh what are you do in between your eyebrows yeah okay here we go ladies and gents just like okay oh yeah yeah that works way better cuz it's 50 H buzz yeah honestly this light totally helps out to know what when I'm lining it up and stuff where I just line that baby up and get rid of this unibrow dude let's go all right

they have a scene in the everyday use tampons for bloody nurses and I always thought that was so funny and I remember telling my little brother I'd like to use that for a bloody nose when he was little he'd get a lot of flooding nurses and he's he's holy so embarrassed I would be saying this that he's he's dead before her bloody nose I'm pretty sure I just like made him try it out one time that is so funny I mean you've seen a tampon before yes this is the inserter thing that they don't have an Australian this is an American technology it's like a shot I had no idea when I can't just go like this Wow okay baby a line that baby up and then I feel that since we were talking about bloody noses yeah and that is somewhere work and you know it well I can't test it out the way it's supposed to be used clearly boy When in Rome all right is that it's not the right way this is truly the line up baby up kind of thing what the heck dude okay this isn't working okay that clearly didn't work in my water yeah seriously well I'm trying to explain the science do you want to do a science experiment right now you see it has little ridges it looks like it's made to expand upon impact of a liquid substance whoa whoa whoa what dog isn't that crazy it's huge okay all right that's good you have to know that that's enough I'm learning a lot I'm now learning about the products learning how to use them I like this better because I can see actually like figuring it out interacting with it its tangible originally what I like to call pasties nipple covers nipple nipple covers we're gonna test these out I'm gonna get one of my tight white workout shirts and we're gonna do it before and after BRB I need to get a new water you need to keep it going love yeah that was Dallas let's see how I distracted him that's great happy yeah I felt it but yeah alright you guys are my nipples visible if I go like this yeah you see my nipples alright now for the science experiment Wow pushing what they are really squishy dude you could use these as icons as well oh this is like when you're at a spa and they put a little like lime strips on your face no cucumber that's all you need is some tasty nipple cutters   sorry I almost fell asleep I have hair so it's like a little you know I have a little bit of chest hair I don't know it's all I would ever sees it well would that look so weird yeah

ginormous nipples right there so squishy dude it's weird oh alright puppeteers are getting started weird no they're not I'd love some water outlet okay guys so I know I'm having a lot of fun here but we do have one more thing one more glove for you to guess now the final final thing dimensional now this is honestly new for me as well I've never seen one of these in person and you can wear it up to 12 hours really interesting because it's like environmentally friendly so yeah I'm really curious to see how it works it's a size small in Himalayan pink if you're wondering most people can use either size but one may be more comfortable small which is the one that we bought it's just a retain pound capacity regular is a four tampon capacity what does that mean these young people put in like three tampons and sometimes not it Oh blood flow gotcha that makes more sense reusable reliable comfortable natural and say is it comfortable I feel like this would be so uncomfortable oh wow what sir I'll let you do it yes this is my product what better cow the heck oh that's cute say there's a few different folds to insert it the CC fold which is default and then you insert it that way right then there's the punch down fold where you go like this and you punch this all the way down in place hey I can't pop it in like that or the 7-fold you like this and then you fold this corner down and it makes that look like it's number seven that's crazy yeah that's pretty well like where it sits and stuff there's not really a way that you can test that one out it's just kind of you reviewing you

we also got engaged and were married in case you didn't know and it all happened in the same here this is true so there's a very popular video it's actually your moist viewed videos yes on my channel and it was his first I'm going to Australia and he came a few days early and filmed it and surprised me Hilary planned a trip became like a few days earlier yeah contacts that's a context that's a context we haven't watched it since has it been since then no we haven't watched it I don't think I watched it and I don't think I've watched it since here it's been four years so that's what we're gonna do today we're gonna set and writers I know my channel there it is we go to videos so fine sort my most popular it has almost as many views as our wedding video so many people want to meet us Oh like on Twitter or something they'll say that this was the first video like this is a video that they found yes three crazy ok I think we just jump right into it yeah I think I'm gonna be really old from when I remember but you know what what's me we've done a few of these reacting and I think all of them I'm really open so that's okay I can vouch for that yeah you're welcome I just well I'm here to support you think this is the first frame of video we're here we made it how Avilan did is gonna bring back so many mushy memories for me I already know it really can you're gonna cry yeah are you sure yeah do not just tell me I just broke my freaking new suitcase freakin a hell of my I want to set a few things up for you guys right now before we get I just was that a few things up for you guys right now I'm a youtuber I'm cool what am i hat I know I like it my haircut I know I like it I haven't seen did he's gettin long this is my first time to Australia also my first time out of the country in general I'm kind of losing my mind right now not really but kind of also because I'm going to surprise Jess see what happens when you leave the US and go to Australia you skip 2 days so if you leave Sunday night which I'm doing I'll arrive there Tuesday morning just thinks I'm leaving Tuesday night and arriving there I don't know I think it's great I think it's great it's gonna be great until I come into it like your psyche you know what I'm saying this is your happy memory for me I know as soon as I come into it yeah I'm for your key all right so the plan is to surprise her I've currently been scheming with Jess's mother on how to make this work and Jess's mom is gonna pick me up in the morning from the airport bright and early in the morning from the airport bright and early I might get to the house while justice still asleep she might be awake not sure what's gonna be happening so once we get to the house her mom's gonna go in figure out what's going on we're gonna make game plan maybe you have just walked out to us maybe I'll go in and surprise her you know it's crazy right now just some like an editing and like a youtubing perspective like this one clip I was on my game to be honest like there's not one cut in there it's all just me talking just laying it down breaking it down I knew exactly what I was saying that's normally when I feel like I say anything there's so many cuts because my brain is like doing I was on another level on this in this clip right now this is why people subscribed because of this clip right there probably not the surprise I'm sure their attention time these are dropped out pop this clip you know I can't I was enough subscribe it's not landing for me my land was edited oh okay guys we have conversations all the time she's like you were a lot filming that video I'm like yeah it's gonna be like once that video is put together it's gonna be like hilarious and high-energy and funny and stress-free when I scented and a lovely edit up cuz I'm sure she cuts down a lot Wow and then it's like full like the rest really well compressed in totally different than how it actually happened she says that all the time like she won't laugh in the videos either because she's not listening we've already gone through that that she won't listen to me because she's like thinking of what we're reacting to or whatever or she just doesn't think it's funny but then she's like edited really well I'm nervous because a flight over the Pacific Ocean is a long 14-hour flight but also I really want to make sure this works in surprised yes so yeah fingers crossed bless up what's up from your boy so I realized that you guys may be a little confused about I'm pulling this off since is a 14-hour flight and I won't be responding to Jess for 14 hours safe confident blogging in public I think that was my note that's what I was gonna say I want to like react to more and make make fun of what's happening you're doing well but like I was I was gonna good notice like I was kind of decent if you everything about it you know but yeah the amount of people that were there oh I haven't seen that many people I know months I know when I saw the clip of me going into the International oh good times Wow yeah I was very confident and I was very confident in vlogging I know you always have been I know but the reality is I don't think I don't think like I was but I knew I should be I kind of like turn on a little like acting switch or that confidence which or whatever and then I just like was like okay what am i explaining what am I gonna say and did what I did in that first clip but I just like ranted really quick to get through it and just kind of like because as soon as you like stumbling over your words in public and everything that you just get so in your head you know what I mean where what are you doing he's already fine with 13% no no no oh I remember I remember people that have said me fit well it's a bit inappropriate see I think I'm like oh that's kind of funny but I realize like any YouTube video I don't know in my head I was like it's funny and like you can't see the guy's face or anything so it's like but you know yeah I get it now I'm like yeah that doesn't yell and oh yeah I know I wouldn't do that no I think I was just filming myself and then the guy was there I don't think he would have gone all this will be really fun no no no I would have filmed myself and then been like okay what do i do that's funny love about that yeah yeah it's okay we forgive you oh thank you guys for forgiving me appreciate technically that was my first controversy yes I was almost canceled for that one cancelling did not exist fiction I know oh good times jess is being super nosy right now and I've had a productive day and I told her that I have I filmed some stuff I'm editing now I'm not I'm at the airport that's like my thing is when I'd like want to try and be funny but I don't know what to say or what to do I like make a silly face and say hey you know that yeah I hate I hate that idea cuz I'm like dude you're just so weird and stupid sometimes then I have some meetings tomorrow morning just so she doesn't have an idea that I'm actually gonna be in Australia tomorrow morning then she starts asking you what the meetings are for and when I filmed that I told there I just made up some random you know things about the meetings and that I filmed every making music please which I totally didn't film that's a lot musically musically back in the flippin day I do you remember this pretty clearly and I remember like not feeling suspicious not all the night before look I had no idea the night before the wedding off we'll get to misspell some tea I haven't done something like this before so like I'm totally lying through my teeth but it's a surprise it's a surprise God understands I'm not actually food I'm hilarious Christian jokes haha God gets it God invented surprises right it's not a real life he surprised Mary with baby Jesus yeah that's the way to justify there it is the crazy happen remember a few Saturday sit-downs ago I said that I think I've gotten funnier over the years ever find my humor but I get it I'm still not hilarious until the editing but I guess I am for me I'm funny in my wife laughs at my jokes oh my gosh guys he makes it out like I don't love to him ever I love you all the time all day every day yeah let's be real yeah here what can I say I'm just I'm a funny guy so I have been flying for 12 hours now having something there's something about flights just international flight victim from Australia that are just like I said most people just like don't want to be on the plane for that long but I kind of like them obviously it's like uncomfortable yes just because it's so long but like there's something about it where you know you're just gonna be sitting there for like 14 hours and you just kind of have your movies ready you're gonna sleep you're gonna have a few plain meals stuff like that that's just like you're just mentally prepared for this experience in the experience because of our situation has become so positive for me that I really like I usually like the idea of it and like doing it even though it's kind of uncomfortable I'm not only funny but I'm also like a really deep guy that'll be funny in that it we also have an experience like any other international travel other than basically going to Australia like we went to Fiji to them go to Australia that was the only other so I just can't wait till we can like five of the UK and fly to Europe and stuff because that'll be a different experience yeah we'd be going next month I know we were going to go next month sensitive and it's leaving before how I did that throw it anything unclean they upgraded me randomly I was just gonna say I don't know how I did that uh you know you got upgraded he's very fast international flight crazy me randomly but free got upgraded to first class I just remember so jealous because like I had done so many flights and I was like you just randomly go up yeah it was so it was so great I was going through my ticket didn't work out the gate and they're like oh I think you're she got changed so then they give me a new ticket I'm like okay I didn't even look at the thing so then I walk through the go you know I'm on the plane walk through first class and start looking for my seat and it shorts at like 13 or 15 or something like that like farther into the plane but my thing says like eight I think and I was like what the heck's then I turn around and I see that I have like this pod that does the live flatbed thing it just randomly randomly random upgrade I've never flown with Virgin Australia before I had so many times yeah and I was like are you serious I bet that was an incredible experience it was great yeah nobody's I think they probably somebody vlogging and then they were like hmm gotta get that free trauma you know and then you might talk about if ever a reason god Bless America Australia rather oh oh yeah Cameron and then like that's like the second default of like is it funny not yet okay Cameron hood squad baby Cameron Paul feet and at the word baby Oh Christian out here hmm I'm just thinking about something I don't know if it's too embarrassing to nobody I don't know nobody goes I really know I said what I said well women and I would travel I was like single yes if I was traveling I was like get my Bible out in case my future spouse is like on the bus on the plane actually yes I told you that and so that's what I'm just seeing you like that because I was like well like oh my gosh now if that wasn't the reason why I got my bag laughs that sounds so bad I'd be like oh you know if my future spouse was like on this plane that was like on the pros list yes of just like once you put your Bible it's like ah wonder pros that could happen that was on that list yeah right now this is legit so cool I feel like a little kid on a Disney mama just picked me up and we are headed back to surprise her there's no steering wheel on the left side of the car this is the weirdest thing yeah I remember the first time being on like like that switch that was the weirdest the first time and then ever since then it's gotten like like a surprise to me that I wish I had been that to experience stuff like that with you yeah that's kidding sorry for surprising you and get a heck of news bro see I just did it I know that was like question your humor my personality yeah during questioning I know you might be because you don't think that I brought you buddy you don't right yes did you sleep yeah I asked daddy to wake you up to get the RV you know to do what you needed to do oh she was like nothing that she was a part of surprised purple I just remember my message is not delivering to you and then that was the thing you had to explain to me and you like oh my friend died of something and I always thought that was strange I remember feeling that something was off I feel like mom was being a little strange with me but I didn't I'm surprised yeah he did put two and two together but I just remember that part of me was like oh this is weird but it was only until like I had worked out the next morning like everything the night before like mom telling me that I had to wake up early to do under stuff I didn't question anything it was only until I wake up about you was super into that conversation you like cool I'm on my way back that's all okay now on the real she covered it pretty well she did good yeah but I do remember just feeling a little strange but you were also in the inner circle you kind of knew yeah that's what I'm saying yeah I'm fine tomorrow afternoon but he lands here Thursday so it's two more sleeps is your butterflies   she has no clue but apparently you did well apparently I think my periods got a little acute cool but I remember that being in the video and I was like oh my gosh like typical jesting that a period that's a hilarious because literally our last video was me putting a pad on my face and sinking a tampon ominous yeah I reviewed some female products it's it's worth a watch I'm funny in it I swear it so I'm hiding in a room and jess is still in the bathroom and when she goes out her mom is going to tell her to walk into this room it not only sitting here with the for hours I remember this like I was still setting stuff up as you walked in and I had just like a luckily hit record at Alec ran to get the flowers and I picked it up and turn around I was like just just yeah you see that yeah like we know that yeah I remember this man look at your face you walk past me I hope to put like my loins funny I remember just feeling like I don't even know just seeing you know a guy respecting I just it was such a weird feeling like seeing your boy know especially because you hadn't ever been in Australia before I just remember it feeling even more weird that like you in this room mm-hmm you would like you know real it was just so bizarre but I just didn't know what to do your mom was more excited in New York she's just dead feeling the whole time she like done yeah no she doesn't mean that you can't see her body but you can see her headache what is happening she's like airing the hug who's right here I remember that you just like wouldn't let me go I know I it was such a weird feeling I remember just feeling like so bizarre did you have a feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night like tonight's gonna be a good night he sounds so like young and little I was like 19 Wow I was young yeah you were young I'm always mindful I know I do say I'm young but I was like Rome wanna know I was nervous I was shaking what are you doing here I wanted to surprise you are you coming that's pretty nice I think it's sweet yeah I think I'm okay though I think the surprising really I think the whole beer is just us hugging yeah that's all I wanted to do mom you were rushing me out of the bathroom because of me we're both country to be honest are you were just like cute and excited and I was just like it is cute to look back on but I just think like look at us now just as in love and just as awkward how is your side he was finding it upgraded me the first time I remember I used to do that all the time airhorn sound with savage Jess has had this ready for me for days apparently yeah I remember my mom made me get that room ready like Ellie that's so suspicious though I know that could have ruined the whole thing he made me that added to it does that burn there I walked in that's the Ramada sleeping in yeah and then he started sleeping in another room like days early I guess like it was ready for a few days so bizarre and I was sleeping in another but I fell for it cuz that's funny yeah I was near for Daisy well well well well Wow what a wild turn of events I think honestly we've just become a bit better in front of the camera I'm watching it thinking gosh he was psyche but I was just so weird you know it is what it is it is what it is there was laughs there was crying there's some controversy in there surprises what else was in there travel the Bible well guys let us nari if that like when's the first video that you saw of us because there is so many people who like discovered us through that video I hope that we've gotten a bit more know good if that was to happen is that surprise that have happened in 2020 I would have reacted so differently but also we hadn't known each other that long I thought then like I loved you the merge I could've loved you but now I look back tonight I'm like oh my gosh I think we didn't even know each other love do you like the Tiny's being compared to like what I love you now it's weird seeing that like when we were dating now being you know married for over three years living together I just like so sick of each other just over it this quarantine is really just tested it yes there are have you guys enjoyed this all sit down like every Lane yeah and like the video if you liked the video that's how it works right yeah you can subscribe if you're new you want to keep up with the stuff and etc you guys know the things thank you to those who we're in teeth for today really appreciate that's all that means so I checked that hooks gone what yeah where's what who's better huh yeah Lizzy all right love you guys we will see make peace yeah gabriel conte why didn't you say anything I don't think you said and I did but it was so under my breath I realized it too these are words yes Gabriel yeah Gabriel like Gabriel like that was I got please yeah what are these words guys another vlog another journey we wanted to start off this video just letting you guys know about the journey that I have been on so far it is you know journey just within self isolation and honestly I wasn't intending on this journey to start or this journey to happen you did not square it I didn't ask for it but clearly it was the will of God to bring this education and new knowledge into my life it sounds like a commencement speech for the graduates of G has been Tony it's not but for those of you who are graduating this year congratu congratulations we're all in this together once a wildcat always a welcome there were a few comments specifically about how I'm by the end of the year going to be a gynecologist apparently or to the knowledge there of the caliber of having the knowledge in the big brains that one who is of the profession of a gynecologist would have clearly I mean yes it's been an incredible journey to witness thank you I really appreciate that if you know anything about me you know I'm incredibly smart in the area of academics because say it with me school if you've been watching in this you know probably past a month or so we did a video where just you know quiz me on female products then we up the ante and I tested out those female products some of them all went well I learned a lot you learned a lot just learned a lot from what I caught her yeah you know all the female products at this point in time we thought let us put our knowledge that we have learned to the test and the we we mean just Gabriel by to the test I mean a quiz a BuzzFeed quiz a female anatomy BuzzFeed quiz yes you already knew this by reading the title and I've basically wasted all of your time before getting into this quiz but I wanted to walk anyone who's new or whatever through the process and through the journey of my very large brains I found a test I actually took it myself it didn't take me very long at all and what did you score a 90% yes and then I did it again and I I kind of just I kept getting one wrong that's an a 90% is an egg yeah look I - but whatever so now what so I took the test probably in about 20 to 30 seconds like it's a very quick fast paced thing but we don't have to make it that way what I want to do is as I answer the questions talk about it and learn and understand alright so the quiz is called irony 34 percent of people passed this eighth grade female anatomy test this is 8th grade I don't know if you know this about me you guys but I was home-schooled and in that process I think I didn't study a whole lot um well no no I did take an anatomy class it's just science wasn't my jam yeah I'm sure a lot of people are with me on this that like once it gets into like words like fallopian it just stuff starts flying over your head okay class you have 30 minutes to create a little everybody to correctly label everything on this test I expect all of you to get an A so I hope you studied click on where the vaginas looking the Baga now where do i click that looks like the actual part of the body gotcha and then add the word there no it'll just I can say with your writing room okay so there's a lot of you rent pots here this seems like that's what that would be so I'm just gonna go with my gut and Oh correct baby see what I do remember though from our female products video is that what was it called I called it the grappling hook that Batman had yeah what was what was the actual term ie yeah Oh easy really okay like this swing it up grappling hook Batman I know that went right here I know that that went there okay what does that have to do is I just remember I'm just saying I'm super smart next please click on one of the fallopian tubes let's break down the sentence shall we one of means that there are multiple usually an fallopian doesn't give me a lot to work with there and tubes gives me an idea of what I'm looking for so I think the only thing we can do is go with you know one of these things so let's go baby okay big brains big brains please click on the area where you'd find the uterus I want to say yes oh I just went for it dude I don't even give you a second to be like are you sure how should I do that if I'm the cheetah I can't help you this is true this is a test this is sure a test of my knowledge and understanding in big brains where can you find the cervix I know this one can I come back this if you mind okay I'm gonna go to another question I'll come back to it right then you might be coming back to them most of them select one of the ovaries coming back to most what what he knew that I wasn't angry I need ovaries we like the good job you guys know you know yeah where is the endometrium the Frick is that I'm gonna do some critical thinking here we've talked about that what men do endometriosis is yes and endometriosis I want to say from what I can recall happens around the ovaries so I'm guessing it's probably this thing but I'm not sure and I might revisit that's my train of thought at this moment please locate the mile met reom is that how you pronounce it no idea that's the one I kept getting wrong how could you go wrong it's process of elimination you already marked all the other ones correct look I think I just kept forgetting which one it was okay this one's a revisit for myself too Oh a new graph what this isn't a graph what is this called image picture picture it's not a full process of elimination no because then it goes here and you have gotcha okay click on where the pubic bone is located I'm gonna go ahead and click that wrong the Blooey I didn't know a bunch of blue I would revisit your other ones now because the rest is this picture so you go back to the top to the first one that you skipped this one cervix Yeah right so am I supposed to get this that's like you know one of the main oh boy in there metrium and doe metrium i'm going with my gut Rob dang it oh I'm already not doing that good myometrium what Google what that is I feel silly process of elimination endometrium similar name is these myometrium would probably be that third wall it's next to it sorry that i just googled it it's a smooth muscle tissue of the uterus if you said that to me I still probably wouldn't have been able to figure out where is the I don't know if you can say that word hmm where I'm sure if we can say this word or not technically it is science but also you never know you never know click on where the labia majora minora what what are these words guys science there's no way I'm getting this right this is a guess ok what the heck yes okay three two one no sixty percent and at six out of ten right yes call it a D on this test study hot an extra oh yeah I thought I thought I was prepared but I feel like when I took this I didn't fully accurately know everything but I was able to either like figure it out or guess clearly I have some work to do but I'm thankful that I have until the end of the year and you don't want only 34% of people pastas tests including me I'm one of the 66 I'm Rhonda I'm one of the 66 percent other people what have we learned I learnt what that my are nutrient thing is I learned that I don't have as big of brains as I thought I did guys it's okay you know why I was hopeful I feel like that was actually really difficult there that was extremely let us know if you guys think less smart haha snow let it snow let it snow if you guys think that you would have gotten most of this correct or if like you're kind of like us and you were guessing some of them I mean I knew the you know the first color is the first we were easy also let us know if you were hood squad today because clearly well I would say squads better but that's what lost today yeah we need to end this video I'm really I'm like very competitive and very like I want to do well and everything that I do so should retake it probably still wouldn't get them all right to be honest actually let's do it real quick I redid it like octal doing it and

just felt so like lazy throughout this whole quarantine thing i don't know why like unmotivated i think is the right word to use i think with the future starting to look really bright and like i don't know things are just looking good comparatively to the past you know two months and i feel like there's a spark of motivation that has like come upon us yeah it goes in waves to be honest during this quarantine time it comes and goes in waves how many song references can we do in this video we've already done two that's what like a few minutes into it we're just so musical   is there one to do with starbucks that we could do coffee yes there's coffee in the morning that's what i was gonna i was gonna sing that one nice okay let's do that let's run that back again oh i'm excited for my

was still rolling when you were when you were ordering so i was like communicating with the camera really well as you ordering but he turned it off so you'll never know never sin never i never thought that i could walk through five years as we drive to the car wash we'll play that like one round each okay so in normal conversation you have to pick one of the words okay and sing a song such a nice day today like it the weather is so nice it's like it is really nice it's actually pretty hot though it's hot new color yeah wow this is so like blown out it's so bright like a diamond oh you you you

guess that's a bus stop and some palm trees it is a really beautiful day though it's you're beautiful you started going it's a beautiful day and i was just like you're beautiful oh my gosh that's a fast car i gave you that one i got a ticket from anywhere i was like what are you talking about it's a prius where are we right now i dribbled riverside drive oh i for some reason i thought we were in residence babe i don't know what song you're talking about you do john leia ventura boulevard yeah yeah i wouldn't have been able to pull that one out of the diamond i don't know if you forgot but i was homeschooled all right that's awesome yeah i don't know if you guys ever if i told you that before it's actually something that i keep kind of private and um a little embarrassed about it and i just don't want to make a big deal about it but since i'm being open right now and i just you know thought i would be open with you guys about a specific thing um i was homeschooled and it was a little embarrassing i don't talk about it a lot i kind of keep it under wraps keep it silent a little bit um but i just wanted to be honest and open you're just like checked out you're like are you done when is this joke gonna be over oh my gosh this is the last one i got one that you'll know oh thank god i'm sucking up ready are we going down a one-way street one that was really funny really good we waited a while to do that i didn't think it landed very well but you guys get it we back yo milo just wanted to say hi yeah give you guys a little milo update he's doing so much better yes um i know you guys didn't see him before but he like couldn't stand on his back legs it actually like used to cave in like that if he was standing up so now he just fully is like standing on his head yeah he's really good now like we're still trying to make sure that he like we're not like playing fetch with him or letting him jump all over the couches and stuff but he is definitely feeling a lot better and we're just per the vet's construction making sure that he just lays low for probably like another week or so yeah he's been on bed rest and he's being so good just to make sure that you heal all the way but yeah he like fully has his personality back yes which is great which is such a difference to what like how he started it was crazy like he put on a little weight oh he's eating so good right now he's a little chunky look you can hear it you can hear it look man you look chunky you little chunky on your face oh it's so nice he's got a little chunky good boy good boy he's actually kind of been enjoying this bedrest yes i'm like he has he'll just like chill even if we open the door it'll just like go in his crate and just like you're so good you're so nice you like it yeah he's doing really well anyway that's how milo updates that's my little update now um update that's funny that sounds like a muppets update i know but then technically milo's are low muppets no i say he's my little pokemon don't i yes because after we watch that movie the pokemon movie the pikachu second pikachu milo is that to me if only he could speak english which he can he just doesn't do it around us i don't know why it's super weird i'm trying to convince him that we you know he can trust us but yeah hold on mommy sit good boy stay hey man my mom oh the fridge just opened so he's like oh we're going to do the um baby patients hey hey hey   oh he's so excited we're going to do the baby patients challenge thing that usually you do on like a child or a toddler or something where you put a snack and you have to wait and be like oh i'm gonna go to the bathroom i'll be right back don't eat it until you're back i've seen a couple people do it on their pets and so i thought that would just be funny if we tried it on milo so we're gonna film it on our phones and then we'll insert it oh yeah you're so excited all right man come here come here ready sit down stay stay stay back we'll be right back okay stay stay stay right there what was that that was a good little booty something exciting happened yesterday something very exciting happened which we wanted to show you you wanna just whip this around do a little twirl a little twirl here hold this oh 12. yeah yeah that kind of twirl yeah so gabe went and picked up this stuff to start packing packing supplies for the move now it's still a few months out yeah but we decided that instead of trying to like cram it all within a few days and then be really stressed about it that we would just like every weekend spend a day organizing stuff decluttering like figuring out what we want to keep what we're taking what we're selling yeah a few afternoons a week just spend some time and do it more you know slow and steady wins the race so that was our plan with this got some supplies that'll last us for quite a bit but we did end up packing our first few boxes i did yeah my stuff i was thinking about it and i was like okay what's our plan of attack what do we need to do and i realized that oh we need to pack the most important most valuable things in the household first so let me show you what happened hey i'm out that's so funny because i pinned down that's exactly what you're doing all right here we are ladies and gents we have it gabe's office it's fragile and lego for life there it is guys so clearly we have our priorities in the right place oh yeah we packed legit all four of these says lego on it so it was two options it was either i break them all apart and like put them in their own boxes and stuff and then i have to try and find the instructions somewhere online or something and like rebuild them all when i got there or i needed to figure out a way that i could preserve them and transport them so he watched a youtube video found out the best way to do it yes like how to wrap them and package them and what to you know how to do it so i have all my lego sets in those four boxes and i'm very proud of this it took me five years yeah hours of me just like packing my legos which is a little weird but it's not because it's your hobby they're very valuable pieces i'm doing it again what do you think that well i just think it's exciting that it's coming so quickly yeah like we knew that we wanted to pack in advance because we just have a lot of sorting to do we're gonna sell a lot of our furniture and what's the first stuff that you are thinking you're gonna pack i am going to go through my makeup collection and figure out what i'm gonna take with me because there's too much in our closet i have like drawers full of makeup that i honestly haven't gone through ever like since i moved here there's probably old things expired things that i used to use that i just need to like go through gotcha figure that all out yes but yeah we have time we have like two months so it's going to be good but in saying that it's going to come so quickly yeah like you know these past two months this year i thought it was gonna be so different than it turned out to be but good things good things are bad good things in the future good car nothing but the car wash nothing but anyway that's really exciting that we're doing that that's our little life update we are going to be announcing where it is that we're moving we've had a lot of questions about that yes because we haven't said where yet we will soon like literally in a few vlogs time is when we're going so subscribe if you're new baby smash the like button and get the bell on and subscribe we're just really excited for this next uh i don't know these next few months months of like this actually becoming a reality you know and us like starting to pack and properly plan and i guess like act on those plans rather than just like the the far distant thought of like oh yeah we're gonna move then so it's cool that it's happening so soon yeah yeah it's like come up really quickly we're also gonna be aunt and uncle really soon which is like that's crazy it's very fun there's just things happening yeah second half of 2020 is gonna be good we're just gonna like share the process do like moving vlogs and stuff so yeah it'll be a fun time and then you'll be able to find like specific things about the moving and a lot of like the housing things on jess's channel i have a youtube channel as well if you didn't know well jess conte super original thank you for the plug yeah you're welcome yeah i'm going to be doing more of the like in-depth packing vlogs and moving vlogs and stuff it's going to be a wild ride right hope you guys enjoyed watching this vlog and have a great night or morning if you're watching this in the morning or afternoon midday nap afternoon tea afternoon tea all right we love you guys appreciate it the love that didn't make any sense all right we love you guys appreciate the love and much love peace out from jess and gabriel you this is absolutely not his face shape like whatsoever where his eyes he doesn't have any you did advise there's a lot of questions going around the internet right now everyone yeah a lot of people are asking what day is it what vlog is it it's another day and it's another vlog I think the biggest question people are asking is why do you have your lenses in doubt and why are we had such a wide angle and why can you see the table and how long my arms are things of the sort it's like um lens makes that look even longer like my um looks so long this video is a little different we're going to be testing out autistic skills we have a hunch that we have a little thread of creativity and artistic ability within our souls I don't if he did not like I can't draw well she said well that she spoiled it for you guys titled it so we're going to try our best to Jory each other I think we'll have different styles to be honest I'm just like trying to justify my badgering already it's a creative choice it's gonna be abstract so this is my abstract art you turn it around I look like just draw people in for me it's fine it does look pretty accurate already as you can tell so we are very prepared that our supplies we are we have an easel here a little mini tabletop one yes probably kind of could have gotten one that's like a little better quality and more supportive as you know I know we're drawing but you gotta deal with what you got then we have the sketch pad and then we have some monkey crazy art I thought we were gonna do like pencil sketching I said I was gonna use this shoppi like I wasn't gonna make it any special if this is why I'm not company I've had my fair share of sketching practice growing up I used to do it a lot Aref you've seen my from my life that was all sketched fighters truly and he's actually very good that's what he's trying to humbly say let's get to drawing shall we what are you saying is we had Maka's he wants to use colors I wanted to use a good old shakopee so you met in the middle and got some college I just wanted to use a black pencil we met in the middle with a fine line it's not like a Sharpie with like a really thick point this is more of like you know a fine line marker so you can be a little bit more detailed a little bit more artistic a little bit more creative a little bit more you know in the zone if you will hey guys hey hey hi hey hey okay you can just interpret it the way they interpret the way that on alright how is this boy this is gonna be it's gonna be so bad yes because I want to do good whenever I may be humans I've always made like kind of animated looking sketches I want to be animate you wanna be animated alright I have so much on accuracy because I can't support my oh this is gonna be so bad no boy how's it going it's already horrible like that no that's already horrible have you ever gotten your like character what is it like Disneyland or something I actually I kind of didn't speak this is so good to chew can I say that what character sure thank you yeah have you ever gotten one of those done where you just have just sit no I haven't I know your family has because I've seen them yeah my family's funny they don't care about possessions they don't put any emotional attachment to possessions like at all like I'll come home some days and my mom had just like thrown stuff away in my bed just because it mom you know you know what I'm talking about I feel like you care a little bit more I care a little bit more than them but like compared to you I'm more like them than you are yeah it's like that your parents that really exploded my brain honestly I've kind of already given up with how bad this is already hey oh you haven't seen anything yourself cuz that's the baby start hey hey what a whine about damn day Arthur are you going to use color I don't know because it might ruin it but it could be hilarious so abstract is the thing that's really in right now I was just thinking with birth in tease today oh no I could be bandana bandana gang that is not a thing band-aid just be a bad teeth foot yeah this is so hard to be accurate at this thing I bet it's already better than what I'm gonna do on yeah what part is empty I've done your hair and the outline of your like chin Annette and a little bit of your shirt all right here's the hard part actually draw on your face I can give you a face mask and that I just dodge the whole bullet there I just like trying to give me like a little enough lines right there and it just like made you look Jack literally just gave muscles I really don't I mean I can give you like I can do that and give you like a really simple cute just like it's there or I can try and don't get go a little more photo-real yeah very very real I should basically just give you one at this point they're way too close together they're way too close together I can literally just like combine it is that what I look like in your eyes not in my eyes but on this paper yes this is so bad oh my gosh it's probably not even know it Debbie you don't understand that and you don't understand do I look pretty only time will tell mine's just gonna be so embarrassing I already know I'm actually really excited to see your rendition of me your eyebrows definitely could have gone a different like style and approach the whales doing them but they're there you have eyebrows okay so that's good at least oh man I don't know babe who knows all this I shouldn't have done that sure didn't gave you pupils really looks nothing like you oh I shouldn't have done that I really shouldn't have done that am I trying to like give you details of like the lines and movement of your face I should have remembered that like if you try and draw like you know the shadows here it just looks like a wrinkle it's close enough I'm gonna go with like two shades of you I'm trying to make soup artistic to your eyes I'm looking forward to that so I'm gonna do that first to be honest oh no this just gonna take so long coloring you man why did I do this I should have just left a black and white this could 110 percent be my downfall for the whole time it probably looks really good like I know your ability say really done babe I said I'm coloring it in all right don't rush art you know why I think yes I could not what it's cuz you're in school elaborate when you're in school do you have a lot more to time yeah sure I didn't have time to like explore my really late artistic side just that's really nice Wow all right all right all right no I'm not done so I'm asking if I'm done I'm gonna add round to your hair because this is obviously photo real stop stop tell me mean stop I am I'm done I know I'm done this is a finished product I'm not actually I'm just gonna carry this sheet off I'm actually like a professional artist did you sign it how do you want me to sign it well you said you're specialized yeah yeah sorry um you are and now it's your turn okay guys I know you're not even ready for this you're not ready for how jess is just gonna completely destroy the games I'm just saying it's nerve-racking right I don't think I would care if like all these people went watching me fail I keep this you know just you and me then it would just be funny but they're there right there I see him I see you guys hitting the like button right now I need to figure out the vibes yeah I'm going got it you need to stay in one position say what are you gonna do okay let's test it out of that face like this I mean like breathe give you a chin how did you drown coming good   Levin den is missing oh my gosh start drawing Jessica I'm losing vision go go baby oh my word okay don't I was literally putting my pen to the you say spilled oh thank you why does it be stop talking please have you drawn anything you know just give me like ten seconds of silence so I can stop the framing Ready Set good oh this is so good you know it just makes me realize it's all those people who do crazy good fan art oh my gosh Leland saying how much time it takes and how talented they are and the amount of like practice it not meant to be able to do that oh what the heck am i doing you're drawing me object that's right that's right that's the key I'm actually very excited to see maybe not no I am this looks like something I would do when I was eight Jets that's when I'm excited to see I'm sorry I literally can't show you this I'm really sad again this looks nothing like a baby mine looks nothing like you either guys if you see me doing Michael this it's to try and cover up my mistakes basically like this is absolutely not his face shape like whatsoever where his eyes he doesn't have any you didn't advise oh my gosh this is getting actually what is the worst thing ever because I comment this on the internet I'm just like not even looking at you at this point you don't have an eye you don't even have one okay I'll like make it abstract       I'm almost done and it's just going it's like up to your interpretation it's like how do you feel about it I'm saying like each time I mean someone watching this is gonna really guys actually right no one absolutely not what's finally right me if it's nice aren't they break me if you understand the interpretation that I'm going for and what interpretation is that each to their right they'll understand okay I think I'm done tying assignments I need

three two one go oh my gosh babe it's not even as bad as like bandana blue it's up to interpretation all right the fergus isn't actually on the face it's actually just the bandage that's not even that bad okay yeah no it's not kidding me no you know what that actually looks like Zac Efron like Troy Bolton with this no a closet why'd you bring my hair forward Fame I had to improvise it was getting so bad I told you I stopped looking at you at a certain point yeah I kind of prefer that though because this is like trying to be photo real but sucked where this is like abstract it has a specific style of life oh yeah she was going for that I like yours better you're ridiculous I like yours better like you did those eyes so well seriously okay I appreciate it you're welcome okay we'll agree to disagree babe you don't even have an eye on you yeah but that's part of the creative interpretation exactly I'm not saying I understand guys you know what I have to say bandana blue all right guys

conte with all the suspense and all of this to say we are moving to we're just blasting the AC because it's hot where we are another day another Vaughn but where are we so it's been a minute oh boy yeah it's hot I'm gonna leave the a/c on a little bit sir if it runs the audio but you had to blast it so we could turn it down so it wouldn't I thought he liked super loud yeah so you got to get what you got it was the best thing I want to say we are unintentionally wearing the same color goals this is a very exciting blow because I know a lot of you guys have been waiting for this information to be leaked via our channel so leak we're leaking it right now we're trying to make it a little exciting so what we're going to do is we're going to drive somewhere and then break the news well I just want to say that we're in Florida right now for a few reasons yes the main reason was actually Gabe has something work-related very exciting it's happening that was the main reason that we traveled otherwise well also this other thing but this other thing that you don't know except you've read the title so you probably already know anyway yes so there's your very important things and reasons why we had to come to town Gabe wants to like keep this offense going so yeah just what about suspenseful YouTube videos well they read the title put the music in the background right now can you hear it can you hear it it's suspenseful and slow zoom in on to our faces I don't know I'm just saying I'm just saying like you know did you see the filter to the color change I'm just saying it's pretty suspect Jenny let's just get on the road on the road again so I want to drive but this vlogging setup doesn't work well in this car we like on say the tripod yeah in LA there's like a positioning that we can kind of lock it in anyway not here so we're gonna just you know we are going to obey our Justin Gabriel vlog channel tradition we're gonna go do this especially that we've been talking about it's so great it's wild crazy special that bird Coffee hi can I have a passion tango tea grande please unsweetened with a scoop of berries what kind of berry strawberry dried fruit or just a separator berry strawberry please okay look that wasn't coffee I were to coffee even just didn't record it but how good is your boy on your girl's order I'm going to end up right there okay we got her coffee sorry we were pulling up to the window so we had a you know call last minute honorable but um anyway well thanks legs let's have a drink anyway what was I saying oh yeah how good is your boy with your girl's order good I think like I also get like this is a really random order but thanks for listening I was I just really need some positive affirmation for my wife you know what I make jokes and you just kind of ignore me in the vlogs anyway as I was saying I think I get it that was funny he was happy that - I wish I was listen I was laying up a softball for you I was like yeah here we go babe what you're an influencer what does this mean there we go sorry I don't know you said softball sounds like this is the moment that you've all been waiting for where we confirm many suspicions now there have been moments on social media where people who are close to us I have already given it away the cats out of the bag - some of you guys look at some of the pause yes some comments before they would delete it then you already know also some people have guessed it as well some people have guessed a lot of different things and you already know we're talking about based on the title based where we are right now based on the amount of suspense we're trying to build up clearly this conversation guys is about way limiting some people I know it's a show some people guest Nashville which is one that I really loved honestly wasn't defined at that love Nashville guys Nashville is I have to sing it because other people guessed New York which I also love so much is also some people gets Australia some people get which is also that's the biggest vibe I don't know how to guess it I probably the biggest time is from a new you're biased oh yeah yeah no yeah no yeah no yeah yeah no yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah no sir with all the suspense and all this to say ya know we are moving to Florida it's been a very lonely process will continue like sharing Lauren talking about it in this look and yeah and residing things are about to happen Jessica yeah we're showing you why the process why Jessica said the process has been a long process we're going to reveal new things however I think at some point it could be cold to do a QA where they can ask any questions about things about regarding the move and then we can answer them talk about them it's a good moment we're moving to Florida guys a few weeks ago I posted this image on my Instagram it was pretty big just talking about the fact that we had started packing my Legos we started talking my Legos just so we're clear on the starting with the important things I guess some people in our family didn't really realize that we hadn't announced on social media that we're exactly where that was the post that it happened yes and so I had two comments from people in the family specifically yell at my side my mother it's okay it's fine we let it I yeah it's fine I thought I deleted it was like talking about like oh I'm so excited for you to like come back live I can't wait to get here and leave back home and a few people didn't see it and so I was like hopefully just to explain if some of the people already saw that come in I just wanna be like yeah explain that story we're gonna drive someone else looks like a pot to of that part two of them I'm surprised yeah oh oh brother dude pre-k me he's texting in his car right they're not letting us back out we're the only person parked in this whole thing and he just stopped by behind a car it's his wild you don't text and drive going he's gone and no oh my gosh he's not moving but me instead of beeping maybe just put you in there dancing I should I should just roll my window down lean out and just politely say get out of the way Saved by the Bell now we're driving to potty now we can give you guys the secrets move morning everybody how are ya this is the morning that we're uploading the video and hence why I look like I just filled up because I did as I'm sitting here trying to get this thing all done and ready to post right now I realize that in this next part that you're about to see you can see a lot in the reflection of my glasses that gives away the privacy that we're trying to keep but I'm an idiot and more reflective losses that show everything that we weren't trying to hide it you'll get it and once you see it anyway I'm just going to do a little blur so if there's weird edits in this next clip just don't let it affect the moment is what I have to say I'm rambling on anyway let's uh well robot oh man this is so weird that we're even vlogging right so to the low drive and we're here guys we are currently outside about house that we're going to move into yes if you remember I think we announced that we were moving out of La in January don't we I think it was Roger so the decision for us actually started months before and the reason for that the only thing I don't know stay together all day it's super silent walking this kind of nervous for say I know we like visited the house and like being a part of this process was sorry long now it was important for us to kind of keep it more private and just enjoy it I don't know yeah I don't know some things are good to just like keep private for a little bit experience obviously if we're gonna live in two so we needed to do it for our privacy as well yes we here yes that's right there I'm one just big announcement loves it when we've been to Florida into it half of the builds yeah and I'm really excited you guys to see it I'm excited to see it together piano finish it's

yeah like spending a lot of time looking for the right lights and like this just so many things that you did building a house mhm but I love days being so much fun yeah and like trouble with like if

would be a lot for Milo and like you know taking furniture out of our place and there's a lot of different things going on in the next few weeks packing up and then us actually were tripping for a

it's funny begun oh sorry Jenny we're an awkward family hey Jenny nice to meet you I'm Sophia we haven't met before but I just wanted to say hi people are like they're curious about Jenny to be honest guys father today was was a win that's fun and now we're heading to the airport apparently sophie has a better Australian accent than I do I don't yeah well no every time I try to use an Australian accent just always tells me how bad it is and then you did like two lines and she's like that's really good that's pretty good Sophie I'm just as surprised as I feel like I didn't say that about your accent anymore I thought you see but you still pretty good like oh I'm saying dude I feel like I haven't said that like oh that was really bad for a long time but you keep that narrative in your head

uber nice to meet you guys Oh what I was gonna say is there were some comments that I thought they were like we need to meet Jenny somehow but I feel like if you even it's like a mystical character

while home back to moving yes we don't know how often we're going to vlog it's gonna be like a whole week very trip so we'll we'll see you but we may do like little small little like diary updates this is a QA about us moving to Florida why Florida about on your house that kind of thing sorry what it was the process like building and designing hahaha what's the process like and hello everyone welcome back to my channel I'm here to explain a thought say it with me the process what animal would you be alright should we just get into it yes overall the most popular question was what made you decide to move to Florida and why Florida yes also jess is using my phone because we post it on my story so she went through and normally I don't know the questions on Q&A is because it's on her phone we decided to keep their tradition but now it's on my phone doesn't really thought about it doesn't matter this is kind of a story I guess we could explain it this could be a whole video we have different like parts of it yes sir might you start with why we made that first trip this dates back to February of last year yeah February 2019 so if you aren't familiar I went through a season with struggling with depression through like 2018 and beginning of 2019 I ended up stopping doing a lot of work and I just had to take a break from everything just to try and like figure things out and get my priorities straight and figure out what it is I wanted to do and why I was doing what I was doing and kind of like regaining my purpose and everything again really and we took a trip out to Florida we got a one-way ticket there that's where I'm from and we just went so I guess I could just like be around family and you know my friend I'm so very very close with all of the friends that I grew up with they're like all my middle school and high school friends we're all still like SuperDuper tight so spending time there was really great and there was a lot of improvement for myself just being around family and friends and being around that kind of community we have a great community here in LA but just I don't know there's something about the community that we have there that's just like so supportive and solid and it allows us to switch off from like the entertainment social media world and just be a people who are not involved with that I actually think originally it was my idea to take a trip to Florida I was like I think you need just you know this is gonna make you happy because it was a really tough few months so we were in Florida Gabe just got so much happier so much more himself from being there and like taking a break from LA I could see that well so I guess another backstory is that I always used to say like I don't think I'd ever want to live in Florida yeah and I had never really brought it up to her as far I was like acting like what do you think you'd want to move to Florida I felt like really selfish if I asked that because she had already moved from Australia to Los Angeles like once we got married and stuff and I didn't want to then ask her be like hey now let's move across the country I don't know it's just a lot of big changes and I never felt comfortable asking her to do that I did want it in my heart but I didn't know I don't know I just never really brought it up to her from my point of view I just saw how much of an improvement he had and like how much happy he was and sorry I had to him I said what if we managed to Florida I feel like that was basically yeah you asked me and you were like what do you think of moving here and I was like and then he had already been thinking about it and then sorry that's kind of we prayed about it we talked to family about it and that's how he decided the fact that it was something that we both were thinking about and hadn't yet brought up to each other and when we did we were like wait you're thinking that I was thinking that it was one of those like moments were three oh you know when you can just like feel it and we were praying about it and it was one of those things we're like okay we're gonna move forward with it and got it if you don't want this for us like close the doors on all of these things that was I can't pray through the whole thing yeah like close any doors clearly don't let us like be able to find a lock or a property or find a builder or get frog out of our throat yes we did pray that like please just close any doors this isn't right and it was just such a smooth process the whole time so we really felt confident that that was the right thing to do yeah moving on to the next question that is kind of related to that what made you guys pick Florida or but Australia since you have family in birthplaces oh I guess we didn't fully explain why Florida gates family a hole in Florida that's one back yeah yeah at the beginning of my channel remember when I went on that long rant about how awesome my family and friends are yes and we knew that like we didn't want to have children children aren't coming in but we didn't want to have children don't take that the wrong way guys please we don't wanna have judge me in LA or California because we still don't have family in California we have amazing friends but it's still not the same as like being in family so yeah the question about Australia it was that when we made that decision we had no idea when I was going to get my residency you had not heard about in the interview that wasn't until June and we made this decision in February so Australia it wasn't even an option yeah which means dad actually timeline-wise we ended up finding a lot and purchasing it in June before you got the notice for your residency it all happened before we knew anything in the conversation of like okay we want to like make our way out of LA overtime over the next year so Australia wasn't an option it definitely still is a dream of mine to live in Australia one day and something that we have really serious talks about so I think the main thing with that is first of all we want to spend time with birth about families and then when we have kids we want our kids to be close at birth about sets of grandparents and both sets of cousins family not uncles and aunts and that sort of thing sorry it's definitely a conversation that we have but it's a lot to kind of figure out yeah Floris but the place right now how and why did you all decide to build did y'all did y'all want me to explain the process that was just something that we always wanted to do we had a lot of conversations of like maybe moving out of LA this was even before we decided on the Florida thing even like moving to Orange County or like over to Calabasas or areas where you're out of LA and the more suburban area but but nothing ever stuck with us like wherever we're moving out of LA whether it's like you know two or three hours away or whatever it is or like an hour drive outside of LA we're still not gonna be around family and we're gonna be farther away from the friends that took us so long to make already we're gonna have to like start over again those conversations were also conversations of building yes well or if we shut her if we should just buy a house it's already there to Florida we went like yes like building a house like we look at houses first and houses that were like new your houses that we could renovate nothing was working out like we weren't super happy with anything that we saw and so at that point we were like let's look at Lots and see if there's anything we can snag up we ended up buying it under market value which at the time was like you know that it was like the right move the fewer if we were getting at that which was really like my dad actually told us that he was like hey you're getting something under market value like that's a sign from God right now yeah another thing is that real estate and buying or building or sorry I was like this when you started talking and I was like oh I guess this is staying the video something out of it what I was saying is that Florida is so much less expensive than LA in California California in general is a very expensive place that goes especially and so when we were thinking la it's just le is just really expensive isn't it and sorry what you can get is in Florida isn't it for the price what am I trying to say wish me well you can get more for your money in Florida which was like another huge loss for us and you know I say stay more bang for your buck dude you know that's what they say I think also like it is expensive living out here we don't have family and the main reason that we were in that Los Angeles I would say is for your acting yeah my acting stuff and during that time of like re-evaluating everything that I wanted to do and why I was doing and everything like I still love acting and it's something that if opportunities come up I'll take them but it's not something I'm that aspect of like my career I'm not like actively pursuing that right now yes did you have the house custom-built yes it sort of yeah yeah so we had based our house off of a design that we had already seen and we weren't super fussy either we would recite has four bedrooms or so that's our thing you know you're like we weren't super specific with the actual architectural design at the house yeah and so we're like oh you know what we would like this but like let's make this smaller and then let's change this very technically it was costume mm-hmm but we changed things about a pre-existing plan that we liked yes I think that's just an easy place to start from too because like designing from like nothing it would be like kind of daunting I feel like and we weren't that picky so the charity said that so I'm just gonna keep rambling on a little bit so then did you sell all your furniture or did you hire a moving company to take it to Florida well so far we have everything so far   thanks everyone cut I'm here I'm here anytime I'm here till we move to Florida do you know what I just heard it no guys look nice collision almost first day signed a deal or something whatever the whites are anyway we're actually gonna be selling a lot of furniture so let me actually start out with us we're getting a shipping company who's going to drop off a container we're packing up all our stuff in there and then shipping it across the country then we ourselves are driving in our car so we're not like having to drive like a big u-haul truck or you know like hitch something to the back of our Jeep for yeah across the country the reason we're selling our furniture is because we were able to get a much smaller container if we sold a lot of the furniture and we're using some of our furniture in the house still but you're just spending so much money shipping the stuff that we were like yeah and we were like maybe we can just buy new stuff with the money that we're saving not shipping all these like big items I'm not saying that like were saving money doing it this way like we're still paying a little bit more buying furniture but I was ready for some new furniture um I know that sounds so weird well there's a few things like this couch the amount of times I have had to clean it because we had were training Milo like stuff like that it's a random little thing second thing we have friends who have been waiting for us to move so they could buy our furniture so we've already had people that are like ready to buy off any shop and then I feel like I want to tangent right now yeah go baby but me basically got all of this furniture but a few years like we had got his couch in our first apartment together then we moved into a house for a few months and to get some more furniture injury it wasn't like I got to design the whole up in my head and it all look and make the right choices yes whereas now I like have boards on Freddy shop but like to finish that I want said all looks really pretty together she's an interior designer Chris I'm not fine about I do enjoy it all of those reasons who likes yet let's take some with us sell some we also like during spend as much shipping in our bus area that's such a lot there's a few reasons I mean really those are excuses for us to buy new furniture I know but it just basically following on from that which is kind of same how Simula is to five of your current and potential car we actually got this question the other day from my friends and I would say it is very similar but more cohesive yes more cohesive and I would say a little brighter out woods a lotta look like these woods are kind of like Mourdock the woods that we're getting a lot and more natural and earth yes SCE you're welcome I'm here until Thursday sign the deal um but yeah I would still say sake like similar vibe will we get one last love with Bobby and said 1,000% yeah we definitely want to say goodbye to yes well though it's not good - what I keep I'm now saying to you that it's like it's like we'll see you soon because I always gonna be back here yeah but it's just like I mean we have like obviously friends here but then even like work and stuff some stuff that we have local here that we would be back for anyone before we'll definitely film that all right and last but not least last but not least what I love what did you tell last cuz it's like a cheerleading chat okay which spot will be the place for your Laker the Oh baby Oh sake like her was his best bucks he packed that up first saying that it was the most important thing don't even get me started dude you'll meet her inside he's displaying them and get me started dude he's gonna have his own separate office in this new house I have my own separate oven so he can do whatever he wants in this office of his that's what he's gonna display don't even get me started okay no this is the real I think I'm going to have in my office still have a closet kind of like lined with the current sets that I have now but I'm trying to get a desk that's like bigger than a normal-sized desk so I can solve my stuff but also there's a specific Star Destroyer guys that is massive it's like huge it's like way too much money yes

vlog that's it no doubt enjoy welcome back welcome back everybody navigate and well another day and welcome to another one dog we're located in front of I don't even see Office Depot there are very special reason the specific reason that we're here for is to doing this thing again today we are having a little farewell get-together yes oh my gosh my family needs to stop calling alright so yes we are having a farewell get together today because we leave LA in a few days it's bittersweet it's happy it's sad it feels like we haven't had a friend hang out since last year so we're really excited but we also we thought like I lost oh my gosh I'm doing this welcome to the club this is that lost not lost obviously we're going to be back in LA yeah yeah but of us living in LA so I'll ask it together sir we thought dang it we need to give them a goodbye gift yeah just was like we should have prepared and got them some sort of gift for them to remember us by even though we're gonna see them again response yes sir I definitely don't fit so they can every once in a while maybe daily maybe weekly they look at this piece of memorabilia that don't work this piece of gift and say mmm I miss those guys I can't wait til we get to hang out with them again so naturally we thought of this we got our friends their very own personalized limited-edition Jess and Gabriel calendar 2025 well there's your life halfway through the year but you know January February is looking good that's when we got Milo so we put a little photo of my love for February March just cool yeah April kind of also filler but dumb photo because it's you know that called in April yes Oh magic missed that place yeah July for my birthday yes okay August a to a memory yeah September was when we got engaged so for them to remember it by in October for my birthday my favorite one for the boys to see it's so cheesy yeah that's like it's getting Christmasy we were gonna put it in December but we put that there that is the gift for our friends yes so these are all random donations and things in the back there if you're wondering where we have 17,000 garbage bags in the trunk of our car anyway Bobby Sebastian Jake anyway we have a gift to give you guys to remember us by for you grab that it's my birthday dude October no you're not in a Bobby trust it's just us for you to remember us by   scan it and blow it up even bigger big poster actually     that is sad what no come on not here here unless you want to help us pack up or something help us move stuff into   you have to when your biggest fan and really tough and they're really rough nothing's working but there's something inside of me that says I just have to follow that because you don't know you are hugging you're not making out goodbyes is strange I'm very used to saying goodbye which is such a weird thing but like leaving Australia and living here having people come and visit you like Florida people or Australia people like and then traveling I just feel like that always like saying goodbye to people so often sorry goodbye to me just like no I'll see you see ya guys we never really showed the balcony because privacy but now we're well gone now is that them down bye you guys dude we're fine we can finally show off our balcony now we're gone guys this is where we lived all right later guys love y'all peace ha ha darling later guys okay good bye Sebastian all right goodbye we never said if it was a house or condo or whatever but just figured it out that it wasn't a house because we didn't have backyard we never shared outside yeah but yeah just proud privacy we never mentioned it we never showed off the balcony because that's like kind of a main issue road we have a balcony and it's a condo and we're not here anymore by the time you're watching this actually by the time you're watching this we might be packing up and driving off like we haven't had that in literally since early January of every yeah it was really good this really glad we recorded it - not that we film too much but like just for memories I'm glad I don't have this we'll see you guys in the final few days and thank you guys for change be sad yeah and gabriel conte shipping container is oh my gosh where is the shipping container   what up guys it is currently july 9th two days before we leave before we leave la for good these two things are making the move seem very real right now because up until now it's been kind of like weirdly vague we're saying bye to people but we're still in the you know in the house and everything like that i don't know just hasn't felt fully real today it's starting to feel very very real because the first thing you can see our shipping container that just arrived today right there i don't know if you can see it but that thing this thing reason number two why this is feeling very real is because our first like big pieces of furniture have just been picked up like ones that we've uh sold to some friends and stuff like that just picked up look at uh our bed right now it is on the floor i just put the bench that was there to the side and someone came and picked up um the whole bed frame so today is day one of actually packing up our shipping container and things are like yeah next day check in the day before we leave this place right babe this place okay we get it i'm still going through puberty no that actually happened to me too i was going to make fun of you and then it genuinely really things are going the tv stand is here the dresser from our room is over there we have friends coming over in like 20 minutes to pick up a lot of furniture like within the next few hours of like lugging things out for them this is probably basically gonna be empty for the most part yeah which is a little crazy i guess we'll check in back then and then uh tomorrow as we do the final few packing things before we get on our way we're doing it guys so uh homie number one showed up chad say hey number one number well is that official you're the number one homie bro oh you just be real you know why you're the number one homie because my wife asked for two eggs so i knew who to reach out to him even though she asked me to reach out to him specifically because he was coming over to help us pass out really yeah i did yeah chad seems like a guy who has good eggs he's a good egg that guy he's a good guy anyway she asked for two eggs and chad came over and brought two eggs   i think it's hilarious it is it is funny agree with me you're probably right however i think it's hilarious oh my gosh anyway um chad is helping us move things because he's homie number one and then his friend is coming to pick up a lot of the furniture because they're taking it that's when all of this will be empty and i've been working out for this pads already so apparently jess and chad just started freaking out at this it's the life hack of packing things in ziploc bags so i just pack the hdmi cords but you do it so then you have a little hole and then you just go like this i'm honestly so impressed right now i haven't seen that before i have never seen that in my life you know there's machines for that but why do i just want to hire you why spend money when you can just you got that the god god built just keep rolling with it i don't even know i like it esophageal valve no what is the machine called the sucker the vacuum my vocab is awesome chad just left he was a huge help massive help our storage unit is completely cleaned out our house is check this out it's definitely getting it like it's messy things are gone most of everything in cabinets are like out in boxes we've been loading up the container outside so that'll get picked up tomorrow it's happening guys it's like legit things are going the desks are gone the bed here is gone we also need to mention which we've forgotten for so long but i remembered because i actually had to go and cancel it today we canceled our po box the one that's in any video descriptions before july 11th 2020 has the wrong po box address yes and please like never feel pressure to send us anything but we're just grateful for people that do send us letters we just wanted to say like go and send it to that address because there's we have our new address below yes in case you were wondering that's that update and i think we'll check in tomorrow in three two one tomorrow today it is the next day the final day we leave this place today how are we feeling babe you want to tell them about your moment in the shower that you had first of all i just want to say i know i look like a mess it's okay no you don't moving days never glamorous if there's one thing we want to take away from this whole experience is that the moving day is never glamorous it's whatever it's fun yeah i was just telling gabe that like i'm having these little sentimental moments about everything like he just made a coffee and i was like it's your last coffee you know what was weird is i had a moment yesterday when i was at the storage unit with chad i had to run back in to grab one last thing but i did it by myself and as i was closing it i like took the lock off and took it with me because it's our lock and like i just left it and i was like looking at it just empty it was very weird moment i think because i was by myself i like it allowed me to like actually think about it yeah and i was looking at it and i was like the storage unit has been with us for years but yes i was showering this morning and i was like this is my last shower my last what did i just say your last shower oh hello american it's okay i was just doing an american accent before no she was doing a country accident we were listening to a country song and then we're like singing and we're just like dancing are going sunrise sunburn sunset repeat yeah i was in the shower and i was like this is my last shower in here so just like yeah it's a day full of glass anyway the real reason we came on is to show my last coffee that i've made here and um but last coffee wow that that hit that hit me that hit me all right i gotta keep packing i don't want to cry   don't know what time it is but basically the pod i can show you is outside shipping container   is okay that's gabe down there oh my gosh where is the shipping container okay it's a little bit later um gabe's currently on the phone well he's trying to get on the phone with our shipping container company because they they picked it up like we didn't even get a call saying that they were going to pick it up women to have 30 minutes notice i'm pretty sure to say like hey we're gonna come pick it up just so you know we're 30 minutes away nothing and we still have so much stuff to put in it all right yeah thanks for the help so that's the end of the shift and they didn't call me saying they were coming and now we can't access it till monday we think we figured out a plan for all this stuff ah same sorry if you didn't catch what the last clip was basically there was some reason why they didn't they weren't able to bring the container back to us but they were like well you can access it like before it gets shipped monday morning today's saturday we were going to leave sunday morning but we have boxes we have so much that we still need to pack into the pod that i think we're going to stay an extra night leave monday morning so we have to get some sort of u-haul or something where we can like hitch to the back of our car pack that up hold on to it till monday then take that to the shipping container unload everything from the thing into the shipping container drop the u-haul off and then we'll be on the road to arizona yes probably sweating moving a bunch of boxes and stuff and then i have to sit in the car for six hours all moist but i think everything works out there might be a reason why god didn't want us on the road yeah tomorrow morning i believe there's a reason for it yeah even though it's frustrating and stressful i just didn't think we thought we had as much as we have no way that's what it comes down i was like the last two days of packing is going to be easy like certainly the kitchen only the kitchen you've been in the kitchen for like a day and a half it took so long anyway and it's all fine guys yeah by the time we're watching this it's all fine yeah hopefully it's not end of the world stuff like it's not like someone random stole a container you know but we were both very confused when we didn't see the container there the fact that you got it on a little snapchat to your family with me standing there like not knowing what to do thanks for watching guys yeah i think we're gonna leave this here it's been quite the day but we will pick it up tomorrow and finish off our leaving our la home which is what we thought this was gonna be love you guys we'll see you tomorrow next time next vlog all right peace out from jess and gabriel bye okay

my life was spared the highest name   has set me free because of jesus my heart is clean i'm getting really emotional right now   yeah we're kind of like waiting for it to hit oh my god so what we just showed you was um when we first moved in oh and it was empty and we like sat down and sang and so we like sat down to sing again and it hit us it was really weird but everything is gone yeah you just have so many like amazing memories here friends and it just it's just so weird when was this empty last time we were so excited we're so excited it's just you know after a while when a lot of time goes by you just forget what your life used to be like here i don't know i've been in l.a for five years our whole relationship is basically beauty in her life yeah we met malay like i came out all the time and helped you move into like our first apartment that we lived and got married yeah before we moved and we bought this place and like we never thought we would be able to do something

all right all right fine fine i'll pull over here we got it ew guys she's so exhausted and tired good morning baltimore good morning los angeles all right we're about to break it down for him babe another day another vlog and the start of our road trip so let me break it down for you guys you guys already know what happened with the container situation if you've been keeping up this morning was monday and it's still monday it is i had to wake up early and call the container company to see if they had shipped our container yet and we would needed to access it and all that crap and what i found out from that phone call was something very disappointing that the container had shipped i guess it's not that disappointing because our stuff was headed to florida but then we still had all the stuff that we still had in a u-haul and we didn't want to drive two cars jess in the jeep and then me in the u-haul behind her or something like that anyway long story short we went to the u-haul returned the main u-haul and now we have this hitched to the back of our car did a transfer of uh all the things so now this is all the leftover stuff that didn't go into our container and it's coming with us across the continental united states of america look it's been a lot of trouble that didn't need to happen we made it through and we pulled through it all happens for a reason jess was saying that you know maybe something was avoided a big accident on the road you never know you never know and but everything works out the way that it's been and today's a monday so we're starting the week on the road and we're headed to arizona so we'll see you tonight arizona see you we ate i have more energy i'm alive now she lives she lives we're about to start the road trip yeah there's officially

homeschool brains to just like figure out how to best stack it all up let me just show you what we found last night when we arrived that i refused to fix till this morning because i i was just a little upset about it oh yeah everything just fell over on the drive it's sad like dude this is our imac now we stuffed it with pillows and a bunch of bubble wrap and stuff but like could be broken it was like over there when we started i'm gonna show you a picture that jess took before we left that's what it looked like before this is what it looks like now it's a disaster oh boy all right i gotta fix this i did it babe i did it let me show you guys the masterpiece so this is what i did with it you know what i mean like the door's gonna shut right here if this slides it's gonna hit that yeah these boxes are all pins so it's kind of like spread out throughout the whole thing rather than stacked to the top at the back that's better oh it's hot it is time to leave outside and you immediately swear we should not waste time out here yeah we should probably yeah let's go good idea smart big brains we're on our way from arizona to texas today oh we had some breakfast we're all packed up we've refilled that snack box and in the process i found this native dish chili pineapple i was sewing trees ignited i don't know i think they're gonna be spicy yeah that maybe that's like what's so good about it is that it's spicy and like salad it smells interesting i mean it smells mostly like pineapple but then there's a little flavor flav to them you know we're all waiting it's a very strange combination but it slaps really it really does is it spicy a little but not really you know in spider-man what's spider-man's friend's name in the new and the new ones he's not the star of the show but he's there and he compliments it in a very good way and he's hilarious exactly that's what the chili is with the pineapple it's there it's hilarious but it's not the start of the shot but it complements it very well what an analogy it tastes like it's going to taste so wrong but it's so right wow well there we go gabriel's groceries gabriel's grocery review that might have to be a little

house stuff which is probably why you clicked on this video there's some other things the reason why we're going somewhere right now is to do something for something which is the thing that i'm going to tell you but i'm going to wait till we park and get there we're about we're like pulling up right now well i just want to say that i am wearing the same outfit as our last video i just wanted to put that out there and say that but outfit repeating is fine it's trendy you're cool if you out therapy yeah yeah guys surprise surprise i'll talk about it in a second       guys it's happening it's happening so it's going down right now guys mark it down august 15. jess is freaking out about this too so if you're curious where i am i'm i'm at my brother's office and my brother and i are starting a coffee company if you've seen some teases on my instagram story you'd kind of know what this is but on august 15th it's like actually happening so next week be prepared for the actual announcement this is just some prep that we're doing we thought we'd vlog it so that's what this is and i'm actually drinking the coffee that we're selling also so it's pretty fantastic don't make me talk to the camera bro why because i love it too much hello people give them a 30 second pitch how much do they know i mean they know that little instagram tease and then what i'm saying right now so they basically know grace coffee is a company yes that's basically it 30 second pitch i'm actually going to start this camera right now siri set a timer for 30 seconds all right i'm i'm letting it get down to 20 seconds the basic heart behind what we're trying to do is provide premium coffee with eternal purpose so with all of our coffee it's all fair trade organic it's just basically the best coffee that we could find and the whole purpose of it is to this is way too long ah say no more all right you guys wait no no no next week or follow the instagram i didn't even hit the eternal purpose piece i was going to leave him hanging i was going to give him a little bite and just say like hey that's it next week race coffee people all right it's happening mason just sent me the first edit of one of the photos check this out looks so sick my gosh hi guys so this is where i work now i'm so excited guys keep me in your thoughts and prayers yes let's keep vlogging today we are back in the car we're back in the car back in the car so what are we doing today babe well we're going actually to eat right now i'm very hungry but then we're going to go pick up a chair sample um for our new house so i just ordered one chair to get a sample of it to compare to the dining table would which is this sample right here beautiful slab of sample wood right there it's so pretty and so yeah i just wanted to make sure because the chairs are also wood and so i wanted to match the woods first so we're going to go pick up the chair so we'll be able to compare it and see if we like it and then we have some updates on the house too we do me too i forgot about that part first we're gonna eat then do all the housing   oh can you hear that we need to get in the car welcome to florida chivalry's still not dead by the way in case you were wondering and can see my reflection it's massive all right we got it there's an adventure yeah yeah that's the chair oh my gosh i can't wait to see it while we're here do you want to talk about what the update yeah we might as well do this here while we're uh sitting in the rain we're sitting in the rain just sitting in the rain so we have some news yes from the house the update so things were on track the entire time surprisingly even with everything going on we were really lucky we were like wow this is great yeah and also if you know like no house gets finished on time like no build or any construction gets finished on time so the thing that's delaying everything is that the kitchen cabinets are being delayed which means that even if we wanted to move in before the kitchen was done and that was like the last thing that was going to get done we can't because there's this thing called a certificate of occupancy that after the house is done you get that to be able to move in but you need a working kitchen we would totally live and like in there until the kitchen came oh for sure we can't we would be like oh the kitchen's not fully done fine we'll like we'll make we'll live in the rest of the house while the kitchen is yeah it delayed it like a few months actually yeah so it kind of sucks just that one piece just like you know but yeah sensitive topic but it's all going to happen in the perfect timing yes god wants us moving in there at the time he wants us moving in there that's just what it really comes down to so that's our update i know a lot of people are asking questions about it and we're not moving in in august and maybe not in september dang it but you know we'll we'll keep you guys updated when we know more it's just out of our control out of so many people's control i don't know what else to say it is sad we're gonna look at the chair though hopefully it looks really cute whether we order more or return them that is the decision we're making and we're gonna go do that this instant wow it's only a small box it's only a small chair this chair is way too big no it's not yeah it is it's a normal chair that's a massive chair what are you talking about it's massive hold on on the butt space it has a lot of butt space but that's like so much better actually is it i think we need to get them to sit on it when they finish their meeting okay oh my gosh that is so nice babe are you kidding me if that's not vibe city then i don't even know what it is i think that'll look really cute i wonder if it's too much like i wonder if we need to separate it with a rug or something all i know is that i'm vibing out right now so all right guys let the sit test commence that chair okay sit on it feels like a chair does it feel like a chair it's cute i like it i mean i also have like longer legs so maybe have somebody with short legs test it perfect claudio we need you all right claudia's on a call so mason can you do a sit test for us sit test a sit test that's really important very serious sit on it literally the same reaction i share i have long legs though that's what i just said thank you thank you that's what i've been telling jess but check out our wood samples this is actually the chair that we're just going to put legs on it how do you feel about sitting on the chair i like it okay yeah that's a three out of three good sit test thank you well done thank you guys for uh being part of the sit test i'm pretty new to the sit test so you could call me a babysitter oh wow that's uh good one that wasn't supposed to be on him never became part of the sit test he's uh too important on phone calls being the boss and whatever this is part of our florida life now coming to the office because uh me and my brother are working together on some stuff so it's really fun yeah because we always work from home whether it's like vlogging or they're editing the videos or whatever it is even though jenny edits hey jenny i ate it still just edits her some of her stuff um all of my stuff oh here yeah yeah but just like everything else is like from home we don't have like a place to go work so it's really nice like leaving having somewhere to go most jobs are out of the house so that's this isn't news to anyone actually true yeah yeah it does help coming somewhere yeah it like helps separate it a little bit yeah so when you come home you're able to like separate work and personal space and stuff which is really nice but anyway we're gonna get back to work now mm-hmm august 15th august 15th so exciting to the calendar love you guys see you next time peace out peace out i'm getting really bad at the soundtrack oh i get worse over time yeah 100 peace out from jess gabriel  was

keep your marriage strong when you're stressed my husband and i are having troubles first of all sorry that you're having troubles yeah stressing is never a fun thing what came to mind when i read that was that it's really important to remember that you're on the same team if we're both stressed and there's like kind of i don't know some sort of tiff between us we have to put our emotions aside and intentionally approach all those conversations knowing that we both have the same goal in mind which is to not be stressed help each other out and get past whatever it is that's there so approaching conversations like that i think is a really good mindset to have also on like a practical note if you're stressed about like whether it's a lot of work or whatever it is that you have being really organized and then setting time aside just for you guys and like separating personal time and work time and stuff like that it's not play time though oh but it's always play time separating those two things and really organizing your schedule to make sure that you're not as stressed out as you typically would be i think would help to even avoid a lot of those situations can you speak a bit on money saving tips hashtag college student like a lot of times when i hear advice from like people who give advice on finance stuff sometimes they literally say like you need to find a higher paying job due to like whether it's where you live or your family how big your household is stuff like that like sometimes you need a higher paying job so if you're a broke college student and maybe you're only working like 10 hours a week at i don't know wherever it is you'd be working whether it's like a new job or more hours or whatever it is maybe you just need to put in that bit of extra effort to like make those ends meet i was actually having this conversation with my brother recently if you're like really busy at college maybe you don't have enough time to have more hours and stuff and so just saving and budgeting is really important so i was saying to my brother that when i first got my very first job i was like oh my gosh i have money in my bank account now i can like go through a drive through i can like get this get that and i was telling him that if i could i would have done things differently and like just not spent money on stuff like that yeah i mean really budgeting for yourself giving yourself like an allowance like jess and i each have a certain amount that we give ourselves per month to spend on things that we want like if i want you know a new shirt a new shirt oh you look at my shirt and you're like things looking good it can go into that column and you just make sure that you don't spend over that and if you've already spent that amount for that month we just wait you're like okay it's a week till the next month and it teaches you patience and self-control and all good things how to tell somebody nicely that you're not interested in them well let's just kick you a scenario real quick oh hey girl i saw you over there from across the room and i was like um girl she's fine she is straight 10. oh that smile and those blue eyes you want to go out sometime baby you interested i really appreciate the compliment i really don't want no effects don't do it i don't want to affect our friendship mm-hmm and so i feel you girl probably best if we just stayed friends well that didn't go as planned but i appreciate the honesty girl see you just need to do that that was totally very not unrehearsed that's how it'll play out every time every time i think there's a lot of different ways you can nicely you're not interested turn someone down yeah it's not your fault no if the other person's like being weird and awkward and like trying to get with you and stuff like that relate to have confidence in the situation if you go up to the person you're really timid you're like well i don't know i just don't really think i should i don't know i don't really want to it gives them room to still like weasel their way in you know what i mean but if you just go like look i really appreciate our friendship i'm not ready for a relationship right now or i i don't think we'd be good whatever think about why and then say confidently and nicely of course it'll be fine yeah and their reaction is not your fault if they react negatively to your confident kind rejection that's on them how do you invest in property honestly this one is one that we're like learning right now like we've we've purchased property before but we're definitely going through this stage now of wanting to invest more into real estate and yeah learning like how to find the right properties and the right deals now i will say jess and i are very fortunate because my dad is a real estate agent and then my brother is a cpa so we have like the finance and the real estate guys that we can like just get advice from to know if the decisions we're making are right basically advisors to run things by to make sure we're making the right choices before we make them as we're in the process of selling our la condo we're trying to take the money that we make from that and reinvest that and in that process the advice that we've been given a lot is to just be really patient and there's always another property another house we don't have to like pull the trigger right away to try and like buy things just be patient and do your research and do your homework just keep looking and then something will come up that's like really vague advice but this is something that we're uh we're also learning right now and going through so as we learn keep you updated newlywed advice date nights making quality time special quality what's my answer to this one word intentionality let's all say it together intentionality yes it's very easy to unintentionally be intentional at the beginning of a relationship it's really easy to want to do the picnic to do the take them to a nice fancy date it's all new exciting you're just like effortlessly putting an effort whereas time goes by you naturally just kind of get lazy you just kind of get used to each other and you're like just so comfortable around each other that it kind of feels that you don't need to like do these extravagant things or super intentional things one piece of advice i would say is know their love language because that has really helped us yes in being intentional with each other yeah if you can take a night to like have a date night like for us we're like we're gonna go on a date night tomorrow i texted her i was like babe we haven't spent a lot of time together this week we're going on a date night on saturday night why are you laughing at me dude and i was playing the piano while i was doing that how do you save up for a deposit on a house patience patience and budgeting if you're making this much right and you're spending this much you're not saving anything for the future if you're making this much and you spend this much of it and you're really living frugally compared to what you make you have a lot to play with and save and we watch and listen and read to a lot of like finance advice we read to a lot of finance advice guys can you delete reading we try to take in a lot of financial advice one thing that we hear a lot is like be really strict with yourself like even if it's for just like six months like don't get take out and like don't you know do all these extra things just like be really strict with it for us this amount of time and then you'll get to like where you want and what you want to do so even though it's like sucky in the moment if you do it for a certain amount of time you'll be so thankful whether that's like paying off debt or saving for a deposit how to stop procrastinating oh boy dude you're talking to a homeschooler about this we'll answer this later i was listening to a really good podcast the other day that was talking about maintaining focus and sorry he was just like going at my arm was listening to a really good podcast the other day and he listed several things to maintain your focus the main one was to not go on your phone as soon as you wake up or just throughout the day if you pick up your phone to like read one text message you stay on your phone for like 20 minutes yeah also everything that happens on your phone is very reactionary yes very infrequently are you being proactive on something when going on your phone when you're like getting at your to-do list right you're being proactive you're like i need to get this done and you get this done and you get that done if you have your phone like on and it's dinging and vibrating you're going into reactive state where you're trying to react to things that are happening to you rather than being proactive on things yes so that was advice that he was saying to like in the morning if you can just don't look at your phone first thing in the morning because then your brain automatically goes into that reactive state rather than staying in that proactive state yeah the second thing that i have just started to try out is this thing where you work for 25 minutes and then you take a break for five minutes so you technically allow yourself five minutes of distraction or like procrastination and then you go back into 25 minutes of working anyway guys that is it for our advice question keep killing it out there keep searching for the right advice and the right questions we're doing the same with you all we love you anyway i hope you guys enjoyed this advice and enjoyed milo playing fetch the whole time peace out from jess and gabriel kanti yo i got a first try that time i'm connor and milo where are you at there he is say hi say hello and let's say that you try our coffee and you hate it you do one of these and you think it's total crap   grace coffee we aim to fill both the mugs and hearts of people across the globe our subscription gives you the benefit of drinking premium organic fair trade coffee while saving the life of a child from extreme poverty we've partnered with compassion international in a way that allows each coffee subscription to directly impact an individual specific child in a third world country so you won't just know the cause you're supporting you'll know the actual child you're supporting the objective vision and heart of this mission is to deliver quality coffee with eternal purpose know that with every step you take you're making a profound impact on the life of a child in need what you just saw was the video that claudio and i put together and mason actually who's in the other room say hey mason that was what we put together call it our meaning video that's what it's called here in the office our meaning video for grace coffee which we're very excited to announce right now you can order coffee the mugs it's on pre-order right now with the ceo like to sit down and uh chat a little bit more about what's going on i'm not the ceo jesus oh there we go god is the ceo god is our ceo we're just passengers on his train ah just trying to drink a good cup of joe you know i feel like i should get some coffee in my system bro take a sip i'm on baby baby vibes really it's daddy vibes the picture that maddie posted for me this weekend on the uh on my instagram i think my caption was love doing life with this little guy but i almost went with daddy vibes my gosh back to business ladies and gentlemen grace coffee gave them the 30 second pitch last week yeah which didn't finish we explained that it's a coffee subscription service that allows you to get a subscription coffee delivered right to your door you pick the frequency you pick your coffee there's the beans grounds k-cups all that you can pick whatever you prefer but then there's also like an eternal purpose thing attached to that which i'll let you take over you guys just saw the video so we partnered with compassion international and basically what that allows us to do is connect individual people individual customers you directly to specific children usually the way that it works is families or individual people will sponsor directly children in third world countries so both gabby and i actually have sponsored children that we sponsor through compassion yeah and they get we have their education um access to clothing food water all that we came up with the idea oh it'd be really cool because like everyone for the most part unless you're crazy like jess drinks coffee it's kind of a daily thing that you do so we're like how can we help someone continue just doing that but also attach a purpose to what it is and there's such an aspect of community around coffee as well and then as like christians and believers this idea popped into our head kind of a while ago but it's been about a year now that we've been working on building it out because we have a whole like system on the back of the website that's able to pair subscriptions with kids and um so it's taken a lot of time a lot of energy a lot of money even too and a lot of investment to actually get the system on our site working perfectly the way that we wanted to to actually connect you guys with children through compassion and then on top of that there's been a lot of communicating with compassion and actually making sure that that part of the partnership is working really well at the end of the day we're really excited because we've really put together not just some really phenomenal coffee but connected it to something that is so much more meaningful there is real purpose behind doing something for children in third world countries who literally don't have anything and this is a way to kind of invest directly into their lives in a meaningful way what compassion is doing is a really really cool huge difference and then just like for full transparency sake because it is connected to like donating essentially we have a full like breakdown chart on our website of how kind of like the finances work behind it and where like where the money goes and what it's spent on and stuff like that every single subscription goes towards the sponsorship of a child yes so when you subscribe you're actually going to know hey this is the actual child that i'm helping support yes also if you're just making single purchases say you just want to buy this mug portion of that also goes to helping kids through compassion international the subscription checkout process on the website is super smooth um super simple we're really proud of everything we put together and um yeah very excited to announce it and let's say that you try our coffee and you hate it you do one of these and you think it's total crap i didn't think you were actually gonna do that i wasn't your headphones are right here listen when you're filming a youtube video you gotta you know do it for the vlog no but if you try our coffee don't like it you can always unsubscribe you're not gonna not like it because it's amazing we're just letting you know we're just letting your piece of peace of mind we have the instagram page if you want to keep up there we have cool content going out for that just grow the brand so it can ultimately affect more kids all right y'all that's it say hey to jess another day another vlog guys i wanted

coffee with eternal purpose premium coffee eternal purpose i see how it's closed premium coffee eternal purpose we have so many different catchphrases that we like yeah i like that one drink coffee save a child premium coffee eternal purpose fill your mug fill your heart thanks so much for watching we love you and we'll see you in the next vlog peace out gabriel why are you laughing at me i don't know every outro is different now peace out and gabriel and milo  i'm confused yeah you should watch a video maybe these are going to end up being so bad dude i know they're going to be so they're going to be so bad   another day oh yeah i don't know how we came up with this idea but jess and i tend to be creatures of habit if we go to a restaurant we keep going back to that one restaurant ordering the same exact thing every single single time literally every single time yeah white creatures of habit when we find something good why change it you know we're gonna grow out of our comfort zone today yes today is a day of trying new things that we haven't done before and this idea stems from us being in boca we're officially moved here not moved into the house we moved here florida and we just want to try new things wow we're like reading each other's mind today just this weekend just and i went to this really cool japanese garden thing that i had no idea existed in this area and found it on trustee griegel yes and then while we were there we saw an alligator yes was that your first time seeing an alligator here no but since moving yeah oh okay but it was in the wild but yeah i'm like trying to find all these cute fun places to do outside it was really nice and so today we're going to try a few new things yes welcome to florida welcome back back this is the issue with this first thing that we're doing is that before this idea came into fruition we were really excited to go to this one restaurant where we just tried something new the other day there's this really good scramble so we're gonna go back there and get that again but it was new it was a new thing so it's kind of new i'm actually going to look at a few restaurants and see if there's anything that tickles my fancy so we officially suck at this we just pulled up at the same restaurant at the same restaurant that we were talking about that we were maybe gonna go to so we're here but it's okay because the rest of the day is gonna be all new stuff out of our comfort zone yeah stuff i was just so excited for the meal here i'm pumped to eat me too also this thing in the back is actually something for the new house oh yeah if you're wondering why it's all like flat i forgot that was back there anyway but before we go in i just wanted to say thank you guys so much for grace coffee last weekend well we're filming this on a monday so it's just this past week but last weekend for you guys watching this so we just wanted to say thank you there was so much support from you guys and at the moment of recording this there are 28 kids fully sponsored by you guys we just so appreciate that and i mean like 28 kids being sponsored is so difficult for one person to do on their own just because of the cost so being able to do this thing as a community is so cool to see and that's just in the first weekend so probably by the end of the week by the time you're watching this it's so much more and then it's really only up from here so we're just so excited to be able to as a full community with you guys go on this journey and sponsor kids around the world it's really great so thank you guys we're going to go eat see you inside   well that was fun and new and exciting it was delicious back up it's newish well not that place no the meal we've been going to this place for a while but the meal is very newish yeah what we thought was that jess would drink this entire coffee because that's new for her that would be very neat for me what am i talking about is my coffee what would you think would happen if you drink this whole coffee i started to have this conversation he's like we need to have this on on the vlog i was like this is a really funny conversation we gotta have it what i was saying was if i drank that whole coffee it's a normal iced coffee but can you imagine with an extra shot i'd probably literally explode my pants and diarrhea that's what she said she said oh i'd probably diarrhea and i was like i was like babe that is so funny i feel like my body would be so not used to it that it would just freak out because it's so new i'll take a sip and exciting you know this is what the people want to see oh here we go hold on drum roll oh gabe doesn't like get anything in it it's just like coffee coffee and a little more milk in there there's no flavor there's no yeah i don't do flavors i like the pure taste of the roast you know what i mean so i'm sure some people can relate because i know a lot of people that like coffee if there's like a bunch of caramel in it and stuff so that was pretty rough that's thanks to starbucks yeah just load it with sugar triple pump macchiato frappuccino extra caramel yeah yeah we are going to do a new thing now we have not done this in florida we're going to go you know why why because it's the start of something new it feels so right and to be here with you and now wow we're like reading each other's mind today that was really weird that we just said pause it i feel like we were both like okay that joke's over yeah yeah good job good way to play that one we're going to go pick up our lovely dog milo and take him to a dog park yeah i feel like in another vlog we tried to find a dog park and we just couldn't because all the parks that we went to was like no dogs allowed but we're finding a proper dog park that is four actual dogs el perro perritos alberto we have the pop star milo milo say hi to everybody say hello i found a dog park so we're going to go test it out what is this we got a toy is it your ball oh my goodness oh yeah officially doing something new we're at the dog park ready good job   well   yo the scariest thing just happened i went to turn on the camera and said no memory card and i was like you're kidding me this whole entire vlog that we've been filming all day just deleted deleted what the heck you thought the memory card was broken i took it out put it back in then i blew on it you guys ever remember that nintendo 64 uh you take the cartridge and you oh my gosh i'm sure there's some people that have never played that or never done that you youngsters man you youngsters oh if only you knew like us old strapping 90s kids old stories anyway i had a little freak out but we were debating on whether we should like try and find a two-player board game or card game of sorts that we haven't played before like go to target and find something there funny ones like never have i ever like there's some embarrassing like card games that you can play that are funny but maybe we could do that for a different video yeah there was also the option of should we get rollerblades and like learn to like roller skate yes but then we came up with the ultimate one tie-dye which we all know might be very difficult to actually do because tie-dye's popping during the quarantine or like it would be from this will be sold out i'm pretty you know how it was just like the thing that people are doing so it may be really hard to find dye but we're going on a journey okay all right let's go we made it this is the section oh here it is yes we can pick what color we want we kind of like this color palette yeah it's like a lot of different blues there's like a gray blue like a dark blackish kind of blue a really cool vibe yeah i think we'll need gloves right and then i think it's all in here it gives you the rubber bands and everything i think we're ready babe let's go jess is going to tie-dye that and i'm going to try to this long-sleeve one so there's these right that match these are shorts but no they're not in these they only have xl's i'm going to go to the girls section and see if i can find any pants like another shirt because this is pretty thick i don't know if this is going to be yeah and i still need to go and look for the cropped t-shirt that i was going to get oh yeah right yeah just want to make sure yeah all right y'all we out here in the jess and gabriel kitchen tie dye studio i have no idea how to do this i watched some videos so what we do is we completely wet the shirts first and then you make your pattern you basically bunch it up into what you want to bunch it up into and then we have these pans here you color it or whatever you let them sit for like eight hours   i haven't even watched a video i should have gone on i haven't gone on pinterest i feel like no i don't want to i'm just like going into it okay i'm just gonna see what it looks like i'm confused yeah you should watch a video maybe you watched it without me i was trying to educate myself didn't you watch some the other day when when i don't know at some point like some time in the past okay here i gave you my phone earlier come on oh my gosh you told me not to give it to you last time well yeah i don't want to watch one oh my gosh and then we just do i need you to wait to wait yes for what me why but then the ice is gonna melt but if i do mine then i can help you with yours so finally all right did i just dye it black yes that actually is going to look so sick don't laugh if i did it wrong we'll see in the morning how this turns out if i did it to chris lee or not but it is the next day and we have the tie-dye stuff look my crop top i got one wow that's sick actually i didn't totally fail i did that one separately off camera hey this is mine oh right sorry i mean gabe did it separately off camera yeah yeah that actually didn't turn out bad i know that looks good you're pretty good at this baby my first time hi my name is mine yes i haven't looked at these either honestly like i've seen them scrunched up kind of alive to be honest wow that looks so good yeah it's pretty cool that's really cool look at you okay let's look at my sweater is it a fail it is isn't it oh no i mean there's definitely like blank space oh how did i miss the mint it's cool oh my gosh that would have been cool if i didn't miss that whole section i mean it survived though i did that pretty poorly well babe then you just do it again yeah you think so literally could just do it again and get more dark spots on it those are the new things that we did we tried new things and we had a lot of fun and we'll see you next time peace out from jess and gabriel and milo kante we gotta go we gotta go hold the chick-fil-a welcome we suck at this okay okay ready   that's why you turned the camera on oh my goodness it just happened god another day another vlog another fart guys we are in los angeles we are back in los angeles it's been a while maybe over a month it has been it's been about five weeks we are back in town for one week to do some more work things but the thing is no one knows nobody knows we didn't tell any of our friends because you know us in and i just can't get enough you see him do this that's a piano he just knows all the chords to everything oh yeah it's this right here i know jenny added something cool in there right jenny did you oh okay say dope thanks so we are in los angeles and sebastian doesn't know bobby doesn't know we decided to keep it a secret just for some fun we don't know what they're doing today preface this vlog could be an absolute fail yeah like we could try we could potentially not see anyone surprise them or whatever and they're just like not home or i don't know we don't know like we don't know what's gonna happen but we're just gonna see how the day rolls out so i think first we should go see if seb is home item number one on the to-do list come on you know in cartoons when it's like this like that right and stuff let's drive to sebs and see if he's home okay so game plan game plan we are going to go to seb's apartment complex he doesn't know we're here obviously so we need a reason for him to and we can't break into the building because we don't know how if we did we would no we wouldn't how do we get him outside without telling him we're outside right that's the issue so i thought that we could call him and just say like there's a package outside bro and i need you to sign for it like so sorry they just called us we wanted it to be a surprise but you got to go outside out front of the lobby they're waiting there for you i think that is so clutch oh as you say clutch all the time clutch dude um it's a freaking game changer it's a fool proof it's a foolproof plan unless he's not actually there i think we can be sitting like on the wall so he doesn't see anyone so as soon as he walks outside then he sees us then we get his pure genuine child-like authentic reaction on camera i think he's gonna be excited yes i'm excited i miss that dude i know i miss him too what are we going to deliver him what's the delivery going to be trickling do you know the kanye song chick-fil-a closed on sunday you're my chief only you're my number one with the lemonade let's go pick up some chick-fil-a who can say nae-nae to some chick-fil-a oh that was you know what i'm saying we made it to seb's apartment chick-fil-a don't worry it says it heads there's money i mean there's really no plan to it i guess we're just gonna go stand outside we don't even know if he's home knowing seb he's probably in the ocean he's probably surfing or like on a hike or something just being active adventurous i get really like excitedly nervous over surprises and so i i'm like nervous right now hello hello what's up hey sam what's up friends it's been a while sababo this is kind of weird we just had a call long story short we were trying to deliver something to you but really they said that they couldn't get in the building and wanted someone to meet him outside or something so i don't know should i go outside right now yeah yeah the guy's out he literally just called me okay cool yeah i'll get outside right now what the heck that's so weird that's so weird too because i just literally as you okay ready   what up bro are you ever kidding me

of the apartment right there this is it guys   just give yourselves a big round of applause for making it back to our channel and watching this new video unless you're new pause now a new round of applause for those of you who are new and have just discovered our channel and are subscribing at this moment good afternoon ladies and gents and welcome to another day another vlog if you saw our last video you know that we're in los angeles right now i feel like we need a song but we haven't come out with one yet back in los angeles california doesn't work we'll work on it but we're back in los angeles yes we're just gonna have some fun this afternoon but we thought that we would go back to our old stomping grounds so we want to drive by the condo that we sold it by the way it's no longer ours the place that we were in so we're just gonna go drive by give it a little sneak peek probably go drive around that neighborhood just just for old times sake it's only been a month but like for all time sake and then down the street was the first condo that we ever lived in or the first apartment that we ever lived in together here in l.a which a lot of our first logs were shot at so we want to get it we want to get into the building and walk around and just see what's good we haven't been there since like 2017 yeah so that's a plan we're kind of winging it like the last video as well but hopefully you know all works in our favor and god shines down upon us and smiles this day on our efforts of the vlog but i think that's we all know what has to happen coffee this was the spot there's a butt first coffee sign in there yeah and one of the work is like dabbed that was a whole thing that was a while ago um but yeah that was yeah it was right there right there we're gonna go i'm gonna go grab my dress yeah we don't have bad drinks yet but yeah got our drinks got our drinks we're going to go drive past our old ellie place literally right up here this is so weird because we like would never film oh yeah we'd never film the front of it there it is a little bizarre there's the building guys that we would never show we didn't leave that long enough ago for it to be like oh my gosh we're back this is so weird like we spent more time away from here while we visited australia last year we were there for like two and a half months and then came back that was weirder than like we don't live in there yeah like that's not our place anymore the balcony is like right there and i think that's why it's weird especially we've been staying like near hollywood area this trip and i was saying to him like coming into this area in the valley i'm saying to gabriel that coming into the valley this area was way more weird for me to like see these streets although it's only been like five weeks ah it's just like sad but i was telling jess like there's a part of me that wishes that we didn't sell it like i wish we just still like it was still ours you know i know we loved that place but you know life moves on and you just keep rolling so inspiring with the punches our first place that we lived in together he actually we moved gabe in right before we got engaged actually yeah it was like maybe two minutes down the road yeah and then i was living there for six months and then jess came into the picture when we got married she moved over here and that's uh and that's actually down the street from here so we were like let's kill two birds with one stone and make this vlog like super emotional super deep try and get some tears going gabe's like willing to go ask if we can go and walk around well no right now the problem is is that i'm pretty sure the front office of that place is would be closed because captioning not available tell us to leave they're like okay sorry we'll leave i guess all right we'll see what happens i can subscribe that was the p.o box we're just on a tour right now i know what are we doing this was our first uh i love this place we had a lot of fun memories here we had so much fun we just like ran out of space very quickly because we had so many people coming and staying with us yeah but other than that we loved it so this is it the good old stomping grounds yeah this is so weird is it weird is it so uh we made it and the leasing office was open i just talked to the lady and she was like yeah you can walk around so this is like where we first got milo dude i have like a photo of me like right here i remember when i hit a million followers on instagram i took a picture right over here like with my balloons where was it it was like right here   this is the weirder part of the video for sure i had a picture here and i was holding miley and he was like oh my gosh so that was our balconies right there the back side this one's way weirder than the first one she was like so easy with it too she's like oh yeah yeah she didn't care i thought she was gonna say no that's what i tell you baby just be honest and i know but it's just like such a weird request yeah but like it's sentimental who's gonna say no to like this was our first apartment together and we just we're moving across the country i really laid it on thing you did a nice story i did a nice little story that corner at the end of the hallway right there was where i'd scare you all that's the back of the apartment right there this is it guys any vlog from before like the end of 2017 was in here even like walking down this hallway yeah crazy memories yeah let's do it we'll just rent one that would actually be wild just for like when we come back to 11 we just rent one of these that would be bizarre wow we did it dude this is two vlogs in a row where we kind of just like winged it hoping for the best to happen and the best happened we're two for two two like winging it vlogs yeah in a row we just kind of nailed it back to where it all started chivalry's not dead all right guys let's see if he does it for old time's sake oh my gosh if you guys weren't watching like years and years ago we used to do that probably every time we got into the car right yeah just about he would do a dance what did you do and you'd try and figure out a new song for every time yeah we decided that we would go to a little lookout yes while we're in this area there's a lot of pretty views of l.a but i had a question for gabe thank you for coming to my interview jess's talk show where she interviews her husband about ourselves what is one of your favorite memories oh i got it i don't know sorry i just wanted to be like annoying yes what is one of your favorite memories from that first apartment oh for sure and we still have the clip it's in my favorites folder on my phone you know what i'm gonna say right i have an idea oh it's when milo was a little baby and jacka was like carrying him around and took his toys and stuff and stuck his toy in his in his crotch it was like squeaking his toys i grew a lot personally while we were in that space like that's when i started getting into like videography and trying to like do those kinds of videos and stuff so that's where you did your famous to ruin my life yeah i really need to start posting on my channel again i've been teasing that for so long and then the pandemic or just messed everything up throwing the question back to you babe what's one of your favorite memories from others i think just the memories of having milo and like getting him for the first time and like learning that together like we were learning how to train him learning how to parent yeah learning how to parent a puppy and he was so tiny and so cute so yeah that's probably one that comes to my mind we made it to a little outlook gay peeps teasing me for saying outlook we're gonna do some emails a look down right the lookout overlook lookout pretty sure it's not an outlook but yeah we're vlogging dude los angeles anyway jess and i have been talking a lot recently like i don't know just how life changes and seasons change and does it ever drive it'll be crazy just how fast the night changes i was going to switch it up and go just how fast you can get copyright striked oh is that clever sure yeah i don't know it's weird just thinking about how back in that apartment that we were just at this like all we did was vlog that was like our one responsibility each other and our marriage and just vlogging every day getting instagram pictures like getting content yeah where now you know there's so many other business things that we have going on so it's just a different approach to life we're you know a little busier just interesting and weird and sentimental makes me want to cry but it's been fun to visit la i think like we've talked about it before we kind of got to a point where we would get excited to come into la from other places like being in australia coming back to l.a yeah so we've been like really excited to be back here this week yeah and we're excited for in the future and hopefully hopefully things get a little more normalized that we can travel back here more often and stuff good afternoon yeah if you guys are having a good um afternoon morning lunchtime evening let us know what you're grateful for in the comments down below what oh i thought you were telling them i thought you were telling them to comment something there okay anyway something i'm grateful for the time that we spent here yeah i lived here for five years you were three and a half but still that's like crazy that i lived here for five years they say if you live somewhere for three years you're never going back or leaving we did that wasn't true i'm grateful for the fact that we got to film and that we have you guys yeah love y'all we're gonna admire the view for a sec yeah thanks for watching appreciate you guys love you guys peace dude i need to stop doing that copyright peace out from jess gabriel and los angeles really funny babe conte no way   another day another vlog oh man oh boy are you guys ready for this this is pumpkin spice coffee creamer no jess has no idea what any of these are this is pickle juice this is diluted hot sauce i had to dilute it with water a little bit it was too thick of a hot sauce so i had to put a little water in it so it can you can shot it absolutely not apple cider vinegar undiluted chocolate milk that's a safe one oh there's two safe ones in this one let's find the fives a healthy dose of alfredo sauce right here ew that's gonna be gross cold a healthy dose of pesto sauce oh that it's diluted a little bit because it was also too thick and it needs to be shroudable of course oh whoops did this wrong seven is pizza sauce and then nine is gatorade okay that's fine five and nine are the safe cards i just smell something here that's really funky all right so if you don't know what we're doing we are doing a say it or shot it game today which is basically you guys submitted some juicy questions for us to ask one another normally people drink alcohol in this but we have opted in for uh the gross is mostly sauces so if we don't want to answer we have to take a shot but the way that we find out which shot that we have to take there's a twist these are all numbered one through nine and then we kept in the deck all of the number cards that are one through nine if i ask her a question she then decides if she wants to answer it or take a shot but she doesn't know what chassis is gonna take until she decides i'll take a shot i fan the deck imagination i pick one she picks one in the deck three three you would have had to do the hot sauce oh so no there are a lot of smells going on right now yeah so i think we need to just jump right into it should i start should you start whoever gets the higher number can choose okay three two one hey i have two all right you choose i think you can ask me a question first i already like feel kind of sick just smelling it all together oh my gosh when's the last time you guys had sex gabriel i had to babe we're married it's not like people you know what i mean no i have a question in her if someone asks if we could if we i would i'm gonna have to shut it okay i i keep that stuff private why does that need to be on the internet yeah it doesn't have to be on the internet let's go nine nine oh my gosh she got the gatorade okay oh clean clean if one gets used it's done we're not refilling and we're not refilling it and then if you pull that number you then have to re-pull a new number now there's only one good one left go left babe say the name of the most famous person who's tried to fly with you the thing is it's like i might say a name and i don't even know if they were flirting with me or not i can say a name but they could probably watch this and think oh he's full crap i was never interested in it do i know that they were coming on tv but that's the thing they weren't like coming on to me it was just like and maybe the situation maybe she was flirting with me do you want to say no do you want to shut it you're taking too long i'll just say it alyssa violet but like i don't know it's all right i don't know alyssa if you're watching this she's not watching he just like got so good was your ex a better kisser than gabe nice no you haven't no that's that's my answer oh that's your answer i thought you said you didn't want to even ask a question no oh let's go that's why dude imagine if i did a show for that you'd just be like oh yeah that would have been really devastating i didn't think that went through what is the least favorite thing about my family i have an answer what that they live on the other side no worries that's not a cop out what's something about your family they live in australia that's something yeah the least your least favorite thing about them yes that's what i just said no i thought if you had something you would have taken a shot for it oh my gosh what is your net worth i knew you weren't gonna answer this one it's too private i wouldn't answer it either you're gonna have to take a shot oh five you got chocolate milk no way no way dude yes guys this isn't even planned look it's a bunch of random freaking cards what the cat i cannot believe clink link let's have a drink you're two for two i'm screwed yes you are oh my gosh what is your net worth you have the same question you have to take a shot that genuinely was my next question that's why i was laughing so hard because i was like oh you just wait oh there's no ones oh my gosh okay so i took the tens back let's do this one turns to five okay i set up this game i'm an actual idiot i would put the five back in so it's an even even slightly pick a cod any cod oh sorry the pizza's not pizza sauce honestly that was like my second choice yeah i feel like you weren't fully hate this i really don't want to do this go on you i can't you ah not as bad as i thought i mean it's not like enjoyable but definitely bearable who's more fun to be with jess your bff or gabe i think i'm gonna have to take a shot do i want to answer it no all right give the people what they want i'm offended by the way i didn't say anything yes that's why i'm offended   she got the apple cider vinegar chug chug chug chug i should have just answered can i take it back no okay you can't take it back the whole thing drink it are you crying don't do that it's genuinely not good b it like burn my throat my question babe give me a good one who is a youtuber that you think is overrated just take one for the team and take a shot t-series does that count as an answer no okay because that's not a youtuber jack o'brazier no i think you're just putting this off girl give me five give me a five give me five eight what's it the best the pasta when you eat something and then you throw it back up it's it'll taste the same but it's like more diluted that was that one product you endorse that you completely hate it i need to think about it because now i don't do any any brand deals i do it's like functioning beauty like loving tan it's like everything that i actually use yeah that's true i can think of one but i didn't i don't hate the product i thoroughly disliked the brand deal the process the process i can share a little bit about it i think legally i wouldn't be able to say the brand yeah probably not loved the product still love the product but the actual process of doing the brand deal was just a bit awkward i mean long story short we had people like in our house watching us film and vlog and it was just like uncomfortable and not very natural wow so i got out of that yeah you're welcome wow have you ever compared me to your ex no no what are you doing no i never i swear i don't i didn't i have i'm not i i don't i didn't i haven't yes that's my answer would you like me to explain yeah when we started dating there were a lot of things that happened in my previous relationship that were like negative things that happened that i would kind of always compare to to make sure that the same things didn't happen and you really kind of outshined when i would kind of do those self-analysis in my head all the things that were like red flags in my previous relationship were not with you that's too nice of an answer that is of course we would make a wholesome say it or shut it yeah that's just kind of the lens iron and that and now this and analyzed that's it analysis that's the lens i analyzed things through to make sure i was making the smart decision that was a joke because i wasn't smart for saying the analysis you

it this much this video is like five years old isn't it four years ago come december it will be five years interesting backstory in this video though and how it pertains to our relationship this was before jess and i met but because i got my wisdom teeth pulled i was here in florida staying on my parents couch dead for like a week and that was when i decided to scroll through dms and found this lady's dm one of the 27 that she sent oh she's trying to get with your boy i sent four okay you're trying to be at the top of my inbox no i wasn't that's so embarrassing guys strategy listen if you're trying to find someone in the dms get them to notice you just keep bumping and deleting the old ones that's definitely not how it happened anyway so this is gonna be very interesting because i remember watching this oh that's devastating and i remember something in particular oh me too that's why i'm like just so not excited for this video because this is what you mentioned to me all the time you're like selena gomez and i'm just like oh that's not like i'm so not looking forward to this like why did we choose this as our video idea for today okay so we are going to review and just react to the video so let's jump on in how does this have 1.4 million views dude this is people love watching wisdom teeth videos i know look at mine below it 5.3 we got 5 million views on that that's embarrassing oh gosh dude my ears are pierced bro look at you dude i like so young here we go today is the day ladies and gentlemen on this beautiful day where i get my wisdom teeth pulled it is a thursday oh my gosh snapchat qr codes bro you used to do that on every single video and i thought it was like so technically advanced of you i didn't even know how to do that i forgot that i did that wow i have ricky hey tim and isaac coming to film this was a disaster like why did i have my friends drop me off and then pick me up for my wisdom teeth surgery i mean it makes my good friends i know it makes for a better video than yeah my mom doing it i'm kidding mama it would have been great if you didn't they're gonna film after i get out and i'm gonna be loopy and i have no idea we're gonna take advantage of him no not so funny because that's exactly what he would say now i know your friends are so young here but like exactly the same timmy's in his scrubs cause he's gonna be watching the surgery because he wants to become a dentist did he what i think that's cool yeah gabby are you nervous a little bit actually i didn't think i'd be this nervous here's the actual juicy pot mermaid's laid up this is what we all came for all right man we'll see you on the other side right one you could put music in i know hey gabby how are you oh my god gosh devastating bad i was like so puffy after my surgery are we looking at the same thing yeah i don't think you look bad you are not nice to me i just called her dude i did my homie oh gee i remember being alert enough to know i was being filmed but i was still like lupious crap so i don't know where the line was but it was definitely i was loopy but i still knew i was being filmed so i knew that i had i feel like that's the case with everyone life is a performance when you see all the viral ones i'm like surely you knew i feel like i was pretty normal in mine i just like got a little emotional yeah yeah but for these like crazy ones anyway these crazy ones like mine was a crazy one that cold that is hilarious gosh what is my face dude i don't like watching all the videos of me neither like once it's there and on the internet it's like done it's we never look at it ever again and i just don't like going back to it looking beautiful thanks so much   dude i should have put subtitles on this thing yeah yeah this is difficult to understand the toothpaste is going to come visit you yeah that is tim's good like i don't think i saw mine that's funny that you like have them wow that's intense and nobody hears it whoever smiles and does it nothing has changed nothing's changed then my humor was like straight potty humor just talking about burps and farts couldn't hear that you couldn't hear it but it was a banger it was breaking free straight out of hsn that's what sold me you're saying that that's the moment that you knew that you wanted to be with me forever when i was like okay he can edit high school musical in as like i mean i'll date you oh wow gabby what's your social security number five oh no i shouldn't do that you like set it up really well with a gopro and everything like you're prepared love the bit of toilet paper very 20 20 trendy of you if only we knew it's just sitting there like normal i know taking it for granted gabby what's the best advice anyone's ever given to you you should tell these people to follow their dreams right there out the window what do you think guys follow your dreams fire dreams like you're loving though you're laughing so you must have had like a little bit of like yeah oh yeah yeah yeah for sure do you have a crush on anyone right now oh i wish you wish no one in my life oh there's no one in my life on my phone there was that is so funny there was a dm just waiting there for me oh baby who's your celebrity crush dude what okay i feel like we need to have a little bit of context here there has been so many instances where we might get on the topic of like oh an old celebrity crush or like i don't know that topic and he's like i don't know i no and i'm like oh well yours used to be selena gomez and he's like nah what do you it's never i've never said that like yes it's like internet knowledge that you've said selena gomez i like tease him sometimes i'm like oh look there's selena grace that's like a running joke that he doesn't enjoy i'm so glad we did this because now you can see for yourself yeah i get that i said it but i was also no don't use that as an excuse i don't really care that i said it like whatever it's just the fact that this is like a running conversation that we have and you always bring it up but officially i'm right yeah it just gets more annoying and annoying over time and i'm sitting here like trying to dress like her old celebrity crush oh oh man all right right like and subscribe and peace out and deuces oh man my teeth actually hurt because i was smiling that whole time i think oh i wasn't i know that was cringy like it was honestly cringy so cringe dude did you not enjoy it no you just feel defeated about selena no i just okay all right see the thing is that was a point in time where like i did youtube because that was what binders were doing it's like oh we have to go to youtube because vine is dying so we like did that but like i was just like making random youtube videos so i just look at that and i'm just like uh what was my content supposed to be you know of course you would take this to a really deep level oh listen guys i'm just trying to figure out the brand you know like what is my branding what's my calling and what's my purpose and how do i apply that to every single piece of content i make in the future that is my everyday struggle anyway hope you guys enjoyed reliving that with us i didn't but hopefully you did and if you did hit the like button also if you've made it this far you're probably one of the real ones who would appreciate the update

going to recreate some of my instagram photos yes we are a little prepared we're going to try and make it like as accurate as we can but obviously like in his clothes like he's not going to wear my clothes for it but you're just going to make it like a hair style guy version of the photos that's what's happening some of the stuff we picked out from what i currently have my closet is limited because we still haven't moved in so our stuff is still in storage you guys already know the drill but we got some clothes to fit to match some of the outfits that i wouldn't have had in my current closet so however before we get into it two quick little updates well actually three first one jess made a little update about harper and willow stuff if you want to go check that on her channel it's there she's very nervous about posting it but just go show her some love guys it's explains a lot two grace coffee i don't think i've talked about it on the vlog we launched a little daily devos so that is on the website there's a little blog page on our website gracecoffee.com every weekday there's a new like little devotional blurb that you can grab off the website so just some free content free stuff for everyone really but just outside of just the coffee we want to continue doing more purposeful stuff so that's totally free and you can get that on the website last thing there's going to be a con team final sale you'll get what we're doing a little bit later but there's a sale it's starting on monday the 19th so by the time this is up it'll still be a few more days before it starts you can check out the instagram page and that kind of explains more stuff okay we are going to get into a photo numero uno she's got her spanish download all right so what's the first photo okay so this right here on the screen is the first photo so i took this photo right here i tried to do something a little different i got the mirror up the wall put it on the ground milo's in the background chilling on the bed okay so we're gonna try our best to recreate this so gabe you need like a gray top and grey bottoms all right okay this is gabe's uh jess outfit number one it's similar enough oh my i'll roll up the sleeves to make it yeah to make it shorter and then we just need to get the oh i'm already doing it we need to get that black mirror and bring it on the ground blackmail hey poopy head hey hey this is the phone case i was using case to find i'm just going to give you this so you can kind of call me the pose why am i up here okay sit good boy stay oh this is hilarious miley's

gabe's woo i did so good i am an influencer good job it was all milo this is photo number two we found some special shorts for gabe to wear yes so we just need you to put on a shirt that's like similar to that just a like a whitish grayish i'll get you my sunglasses and we're freaking bingo bango dude i think you should get a hair tie and top your hair because my hand's in like a pony that's hilarious okay yeah but that's what we need for this i already do that all the time anyway we're trying to do that man we're trying to do the man yo so we're filming this next clip at our house we just got our cabinets in for the kitchen should we show them or is that a surprise it's a okay you could just show like a really close-up of him all right i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it that's all you get that's all you get anyway the reason we're here is to use one of the white walls here to uh take the next photo on so that's why we're here and then we came to a beautiful surprise of the kitchen cabinets being in okay so this is what we're going to recreate basically all gabe needs all my sunnies yeah so you're not fully grabbing the glasses it's just like a little bit off perfect okay well the thing is you're doing a good job you have to take them from a bit of a higher angle just because i'm taller okay we got this oh yeah yeah that's better that's better for sure okay dude it's freaking hilarious here is my photo and here is gabe's photo looking good robin hood we're gonna move on to photo number three uh just back back here changing so this is the next friday that we're going to recreate so what we needed was a matching tracksuit and boy did we find one boy did we freaking send our assistant to find one it's actually a really nice tie-dye track suit it's very very lovely and then we just need some sunglasses and then you could probably use your coffee cups for what they're probably sitting oh they're sitting on the thing yeah oh very cute how's the vibe very vibey is it vibe city or is it vibe city vibe city live city let's go whoa we found this little spot to take the photo so um now we're gonna put him into the right position   we got it oh yeah wow that looks so dumb got it got him our next stop was going to be that of taking a photo with a human child without nephew with our nephew but uh the babe is currently crying we're just gonna figure out if she wants us to come now or if we you know we still have one more photo that we could do yeah so we can let mama conti do her thing and then we take our photo then go back for the baby pic or vice versa if she's ready now we're casual we're flexible baby photo it is here we are hezekiah hello you look just like my brother you look like your daddy it's actually like right here i'm pretty sure so he is actually going to wear my shirt that i was wearing and then he has some shorts and then we have a baby hi hey   wow you recreated the outfit exactly i know i have a same binky strap and the same thing yeah this is hilarious look at him staring at the phone kids these days how are you sitting um oh no yeah it's okay you wanna know oh do you want mommy let me just get you in shopping parenting and then i'll just place him in here oh there we go there we go okay i'll get ready first with my scrunchie       oh my head's in the bad position no that's good i think okay it's fine do

you're a true youtuber are you recording gordon no way jose you're lying brian but we think that we got a good picture so here is jess's picture and here is gabe's recreation before and after i think we did pretty well i think so too so now we're going to do another picture this was one of my most recent instagram pictures actually we'll show you gabe's outfit like when we're at the location i'm already changed into it but since we just took it we're gonna go back to like that exact location yeah we're gonna get the exact photo exactly exactly made it to meisner park very pretty part of breakfast very nice jess actually took it on the other side of the building but there's too much sun there so we found the basically the exact same spot on the other side yep okay so   i'm yes a freaking dork dude oh my gosh oh we haven't yet but that's that's got to be it that's hilarious that is so funny you did so well good job thanks babe we did it okay so here is the comparison the jess

for watching love you guys hope you're having a great day so far one night whenever you're watching this we'll see you guys in our next video peace out from jess and gabriel oh my gosh just as i'm driving out uh he calls me and he's like finished with the day he's ready to go look at the house and i'm not ready yet another day another vlog hey mike come say hi so i'm starting this vlog off by myself with my my oh my goodness today i'm doing a little surprise for gabe if you've been watching us for a while you know that i just love birthdays i love doing little surprises and i just love like celebrating people so tomorrow is gabe's birthday and um obviously this year is a little different i haven't really been able to plan as much but i've planned a few little things here um around us so uh it'll be a fun day so basically um i need to start by wrapping his presents then i need to pack our bag because we're going away for two nights we're just doing a little staycation here in broker just so it feels like we're going on a little vacay for his birthday but really we're just like going down the road and i'm gonna set up the room with balloons and stuff so it should be fun he has no idea he just thinks i like going to the beach for his birthday tomorrow so um i'm excited i'm gonna vlog the whole thing oh my goodness you're in the shot oh he thinks this is like a toy   one done   good morning good boy thank you for the help another one's done all right guys wrapping is done this is a gift that my family sent for him from australia so i'm not gonna wrap it um i'm just gonna let him open it like this and then i actually ordered him um a coffee like an espresso machine with this coffee grinder this is the only thing that came the actual coffee machine didn't come in time but i thought that i would set this up in our new kitchen in the new house and take him there he wants to go and like look at some of the updates so i thought if i sat this in the kitchen that would be a cute way to surprise him with it okay so our assistant is actually on her way over to our condo right now she is dropping off some balloons i wanted some helium balloons so i could set it up in the hotel room and i got a big 26. so i'm gonna go and set all of that up because he is still working at the office right now so he has absolutely no idea what's going on okay so it's 3 51 right now and check-in is at 4 p.m so i think i'm gonna quickly try and pack a suitcase for us both i'm just gonna pick out a few clothes for him and for me and then i'll go check into the hotel and start setting everything   up okay all ready to go okay i'm going to head to the hotel now it is currently 4 30. i just need to keep in mind that gabe is finishing work soon and then he's just gonna head home so i kind of need to complete everything before he heads home otherwise he'll be like where are you what are you doing so all the presents and the balloons are in the car i have the suitcase pack so i'm going to go to the hotel now and start setting everything up so i'll see you guys there this is my situation currently so we have all the balloons in the back i am praying that they don't pop on my way to the hotel and i have all the presents here the suitcase in the back i'm ready to go i'm so excited hello hey do you want to swim by the house now um are you finished with work um yeah basically i was thinking you can swim by the the house together now okay can you give me like i'm just finishing up some of my stuff okay are you in the condo right now yeah but like i can leave soon and meet you at the house okay okay well so angie's gonna come with me because he wants to see based on how much space we have for it's just some photos and stuff could you give me a little bit more time to get to the house like could you like yeah for sure andrew and i could probably get a coffee here yeah but i don't want you to see this stuff without me being there but i just like i have a few things i need to finish up yeah yeah okay we'll wait and yeah andrew and i will we'll get some movies okay perfect i'll i'll let you know when i'm like ready to leave all right sounds good love you babe okay love you bye oh my gosh just as i'm driving out uh he calls me and he's like finished with the day he's ready to go look at the house and i'm not ready yet did i show you guys the coffee grinder i wanted that set up in the kitchen by the time that he got there but now he's with a friend all right i'm gonna have to rethink about this i'm gonna drive to the hotel and then um yeah i'll figure something out all right here it is let's look at the view so pretty all right i'm gonna bring up all the balloons and start setting everything up i don't know what to do about the coffee grinder surprise thing that i was gonna do at the house i might just still do it and his friend will just be there anyway i don't have a lot of time so i'm gonna run down and grab the   balloons   i got them i don't think any of them popped except they are all stuck together these are so tangled all right one out two okay i got this guys it'll just take me down   yay okay thank goodness   okay i just texted gabe and was like you go without me i need to finish something for the brand by end of day which is very believable because i am working with a brand right now and it's friday but he also knows that it's his birthday tomorrow and he knows that i love planning stuff so he was like oh that sucks sorry so i don't know if he's believing me or not but anyway i'm just gonna continue doing this as quick as i can i love it i love it how good does that look oh my gosh honestly really good job on my part um that turned out super cute perfect i'm gonna go get the presents put them on the bed and then we'll be good to go   all right i've got everything now i can just set it up   okay guys so this is what gabe's gonna see when he walks in i thought i'd give you like a full look yay i think it looks really good turned out so cute okay i just finished writing on his birthday card it's all set up and he just texted me saying that he was going to the office grabbing his car getting everything and then coming home so now with my chance to quickly run to the house put the coffee grinder in the house and then hopefully get home before he does i don't think i will which means he will know something's happening because milo won't be there um none of his stuff will be there so i'm just gonna rush and hopefully i get it all done anyway okay let's go okay i'm just gonna sit it right here all right that's literally all i have time for gabe is probably gonna get home before i get home sorry guys gotta go all right hey guys i hope you enjoy my ceiling i'm not gonna vlog right now i'm driving but i just topped off the phone with gabe and he is pretty much home now i was like oh i'm just running to the grocery store like i'll be back i just you know made up a lie just want to let you know that i'm about to meet him and the surprise is going to start and i'm so excited all right i'm here i think i'm just gonna wait get out of your car what are you waiting for i was just

how to do that anyway got my coach and youtube is also a good coach yes i think we should watch it just in case yeah nice honey by the way thank you thanks very much you're welcome this new company i

sale going on this is perfect because it's very rainy and windy and when it's like this in florida you can actually fully get away with wearing hoodies oh yeah so this is perfect so we're gonna go eat some food and then continue moving in the day moving in continue the day i need to figure out that coffee machine and have some coffee to get my brain working so i just had a realization what where we're going to eat right now it's called another broken egg it's a great restaurant we love it we found it here in boca but it was the last place we were at in l.a before we took off and started driving over it looks closed it's cold saw the cutest looking guy hold on where did he go i need to find him there he is oh my god oh my god i love a good quality dang it i was in the middle of making a really lame joke too i was like what are you filming babe my umbrella's flipped inside gotta get this content it is so rainy today that was quite a successful little shopping trip it was also successful because we found a lot of things and like just took photos a lot of things that we'll probably like order online but i just realized stores are starting to have sale now because like some of them do like black friday sales all month oh wow that's perfect yeah so i like took pictures of stuff that was on sale dude so with buying all this stuff like we're basically making money anyway let's go to target get a few things and then we really need to set up your coffee machine i know i know i'm thinking of calling it gabe's coffee corner yeah or the grace coffee corner because i'm

going it's a couple days later oh my gosh guys we were so in over our heads this was our issue not this i was very confident about using this machine but this we've been trying to figure out getting the right brand to look if you know what that means you know that i got it right this is my first good done actual cup guys it's two days later and we finally it is out like this is the first time actually trying this this is his first successful one okay draw me like a love heart there's no way and something yeah there's no shot all right hey that's a love hut waiting about that's uh well

coffee mug yeah come on i'm an idiot i will try it but i need everyone to know if you're new or you if you don't know i don't like coffee yes so this isn't saying grace coffee is bad or that you alright suck up being a barista this is just saying just doesn't like coffee the kitchen smells amazing though like i love the smell of coffee wow you did a really good job i'm out here bro watch out gabriel's grace coffee corner i like it i genuinely like it that's so weird freaking grace coffee john dap me up baby okay don't drink my whole latte face one do you want one i know i'm just double

mean come on it's all right okay yeah but seriously but seriously we couldn't end this vlog without figuring it out so that's why this is a few days later yeah i was like no that we said we're gonna make a freaking coffee i'm making it for them that was a very that's your first successful one and it's like it's good so good i'm very happy with it i'll just have one more second i'm just so surprised that it tastes very good thanks babe all right you know what i mean i know well i hope you guys enjoyed watching this vlog can't even remember what we did i wish you guys could taste this okay anyway yeah listen that would actually be really fun imagine going around in like a little van and doing like pop-up coffee shops where you just make coffee for people and making a show right idea it's actually a really good idea 2021 all right thank you guys so much for watching we love y'all and we'll see you in our next vlog peace out from jess gabriel conte you have to really make sure that you have me i do have you where do i put my hand there we go sing it with me holy christmas tree oh oh christmas tree oh christmas tree another day another vlog another christmas tree well this is actually a fest yeah well i mean we've had christmas trees before this is our first real christmas tree so of course we had to deck out in our christmas tree entire winter christmas vibes i'm trying to camouflage with the tree but i'm still trying to go all funky with my blue socks you know this is as wintery as i can get in florida yeah i plan on this coming off at some point in probably like the next few minutes of this vlog because carrying a christmas tree is sweaty endeavor and this is not uh complementary to the florida environment of humidity and stickiness and hot and sweat i want cold so bad like i want to go somewhere cold so bad and so this is me pretending like it's not 80 degrees outside where are we gonna put the tree that's exactly what i was going to talk about it's like we finish each other christmas trees that's what i was going to say i mean we have that corner but we kind of want to see it when you're sitting down for it to be like in the main area we could tuck it in there but we are actually getting shelves in there and like what if they come they should be coming in the next few weeks christmas yeah i think we both collectively think yes this is this spot right here when people walk up from the entrance they'll be able to see it through the window and it kind of is open to the house i don't know if you saw my story earlier this week there's the santa ladder thing at target that i want really bad oh my gosh i need it i need it i want it please mom please can i get it please i want it so bad so that's where we're at right now i actually think we need to measure the ground right here like so it doesn't get in the way of the door but measure that so we know the good circumference range that we can the circumference that we have to work with yes we measured it we figured it out we have four feet four feet of circumference distance to work with and now i think we're ready to go get ready to go to the road jack all right guys we have realized at this moment in time that we have no idea what we're doing we realized like oh yeah we're going to need to water this thing oh yeah we need like a stand and a skirt for it jess is reading a how-to on i didn't know you had to water it or anything i just thought you put it in your home and boom decorate here are the rules look for a healthy green tree with the least amount of brown needles select a tree displayed in a shady location avoid picking from a sunny area i said to gabriel how because florida there's like sun in every angle also christmas vibes i did just get a hot drink just so i felt like i was in new york city jess's obsession with new york city is getting worse and worse the more we can't go back the more we can't go we've gone every um like christmas time two years in a row yeah run a few branches through your hands the needles should feel pliable pliable pliable pliable and not fall off raise the tree a few inches and drop the trunk into the ground very few green needles should fall off so just easily lift it up and just drop it trim the trunk and then trim it again then make sure your tree has enough water there's so many rules wait trim the trunk like take a saw to it double check that the cellar makes a fresh cut straight   go to a christmas tree place we made it to the christmas tree farm well not really farm it's like a little pumpkin patch we made it to the christmas tree patch it's in a parking lot which is really funny we made it to the christmas tree lot are you ready oh i'm right i've been singing the jingle all day for the past five seconds let's see if they have what it takes let's see if we have what it takes we're ready how would we get this one home look at how big i am next to it that one's massive you would need like a team with ladders ladders to decorate it that's what i was just gonna say guys i think this is it i think we picked it we measured it and everything this is the one we did all the things in the article we sniffed it like pet it we threw it on the floor or something so they're cutting our tree right now like doing the whole cut the bottom thing that was in the article so we're doing it the right way he asked if i wanted to keep this he's like oh people keep it as air freshness it smells like insane a really strong scent it's just like a very potent christmas tree smell which is really nice you know what they say christmas we did it we have a tree we did it we took some photos took some fighters freaking like the freaking selfies we should probably go get a sky yeah we need a skirt does that mean we have to go to target why a christmas tree so bad at sewing i have no idea because they keep dropping that needle oh my gosh you're so cl oh dude this is a plus youtube content here everybody like and subscribe for more you guys can use that one we'll give it to you usually i'm the one who turns on the camera to record because i'm like oh i have something to say i think i'm hilarious just turned on the camera for that one so i just thought i'd give you guys a little you know inside scoop all right off to taj cheers y'all as one would say in a vlog of jess and gabriel when that one person who is saying the thing ends up at a place in which we call target the thing that that one person would say would sound something like this i did it all right it takes so much energy i think we got it i think that knit one is the way to go oh we need a star we want our christmas tree to be freaking lit so we think we found the star that we want we're currently debating between this one right here and then that one right there with the reindeer going in the circle it's a really tough decision i know yeah it's between the cute aesthetic vibe or like you know fun vibes walked in for just a few things oh no every time we are back and we are ready to bring the tree in christmas tree coming up who's your boy   not only well done everyone see you in the morning and merry christmas and happy thanksgiving because that just happened two days ago for you guys happy thanks christmas new year another day same negative negative love our christmas tree has settled i'm not sure if that's a proper term something that you do or not but that is what we did it's a little crooked depending on which way you look at it so we're going to try and position it in a way that when you look at it in the living room it doesn't look rugged okay thanks darling welcome   next is the skit what a beautiful skirt     oh good boy   just insisted that we only get six boxes of lights uh even though i insisted it wasn't enough   here we go guys it's good we just i feel like we need more lights the vibe is there the idea is there definitely we just need another spruce layer yeah a little bit closer to the front we do to really make an aluminum tree yeah but so far so good we're back just had a little intermission my sister came over so we were hanging out with her i played some basketball with her and stuff like that now we're back to the mission of the christmas tree bonanza bonanza the thing is it looks like there's a skinny christmas tree of lights in the middle of the big christmas tree i think we're just gonna run another layer around the outside hopefully we have enough mainly on this like bottom two thirds i think is where we need it the most because up there it kind of you know does its thing okay like boy i like the light boy all right we've ran out of lights yeah so this is six boxes of lights which i thought was going to suffice i told you um i told you we're gonna have to go get a couple more who was right i thought i thought six boxes like i don't know i know i know i feel like every first time tree owner deals with this this dilemma what i was gonna say was i think it looks amazing you can tell but should we top it with the star we should top it should we top it we're going to freaking top it okay guys we're going to take our thumbnail and you have to really make sure that you have me i do have you we work with my hands there we go all right thumbnail time everyone youtube is fake   down down down all right i'm gonna hold your ankles baby you ready oh my gosh there you go we did it now the real part of it there it is very nice very cool wow that is cute i think i found the point of entry everybody stop doing it like that everybody right here three two one thank you madison square garden aesthetic vibes so far so good with my first ever christmas tree we'll keep you updated with how gross if you have christmas tree tree tips please um let us know if you have christmas tree free tips let us snow let us know let us know that was funny thank you guys for watching hope you guys had a great thanksgiving if you live in the us and if you don't just get i hope you're thankful for things and get ready for the christmas time is near in the city no they had a different song but i got it same vibes we love you guys hope you have a great rest of your night and we'll see you on the flippity flip peace out from jess and gabriel conte did you just do that right now oh my gosh   what up y'all another day another vlog i'm out with dress right now for a specific reason that i'll tell you in a sec just wanted to apologize first that we didn't post last week to be fully real with you guys uh i have been going through a little bit of a rough spot i guess so justin i just decided to take last week off of vlogging and just spend some time i'm just focusing on us a little bit now we're back things are going better and well for anyone else who's struggling out there dealing with any with anything um praying for you guys and for those who aren't for those of you who are doing well and life is good praying for you guys and thankful that that you guys are in good health good mental health and everything like that anyway that's my sentimental spiel uh to start off this vlog jess doesn't know i'm vlogging right now specifically because this beard that's been coming in i think i can actually call it a beard now i've never had it this long because i did no shave november don't worry guys i donated i'll put any info below for those of you who want to donate as well this has been the longest that it's been and i'm planning on shaving it that was always the plan after the after november i was planning on shaving it so no shave november i'm pretty sure is the american version of what they do in like other countries in australia jess's country they call it movember and i'm pretty sure it's just the mustache but but but i thought it would be funny since jess doesn't like when i have a mustache alone i don't either the only time i ever have a mustache is to shock jess with it so that's what we're doing i use an electric razor which is great because i can shave from anywhere and that's what i'm gonna do now right outside now i'm just gonna shave my face out here go home jess has no idea that i took the camera that i'm vlogging right now so it's a perfect scenario to just like get another shocking thumbnail of jess being surprised at something since the earrings was a thing last time i think i've talked enough i think i'm saying too many things and let's turn this beard into a nice mustache   someone's totally judging me from across the street right now how do we like that guys i need i certainly claim the science down but like that's kind of funny i feel like i look like a robin hood or something right like put me in a you know nice little robin hood hat with a bow and arrow jenny right you put that on me right right now yeah   oh this is hilarious should i take this off and just do the mustache i don't know what would shock just more that's really what this is about purely shock factor because as soon as it happens i'm taking the rest off it was thick this is having a hard time cutting through it i feel like a man i think i'm like a little more manly now if we're being honest since this is like an honest vlog you know honestly i'm not even lying i look freaking good dude i'm crushing the stash game strong baby i wish it was long enough so i could like twist it up this is the worst it's so bad i feel like it's a look that i'm not gonna stick with but i think it works because i'm super duper biased but let me see if i have any stragglers oh my gosh i did such a bad job look at all that that's left right there horrifying absolutely horrifying i think that's the best we're going to do this is what just has to deal with for the next few hours maybe 24 hours if i'm feeling you know a little crazy a little wacky a little wild   i don't know what do you think i don't know it's not like the last thing ever oh my gosh this is totally not the reaction i thought i'd be getting when i was looking i was like kind of works with the hair and everything right you kind of like it you kind of think it's hot a little bit huh i think i'm looking at like yeah i think it's because i can see the rest of your face oh yeah that's why but you kind of like it though oh my god oh man but it's gonna go right you should have been patting this right here i like this no no no no no no no no no no just take your finger and run it oh yeah you're so turned on right now it kind of looks like you've stuck one on your head i'm either used to like a beard or nothing it's just a fake like licking stick you just put on like a lincoln stick we'll assess the situation and see at some point in the vlog i may just not have one what if i do it you want to shave my mustache yeah okay there we go deal hello everyone it is the next day and uh still going on the thing on my face is still a thing and i know what you're thinking gabriel you look so good with a mustache it is so it looks even better than yesterday it looks a little more luscious a little more full some may even say a little more conditioned just like my hair and you're right who would have thought this conversation would have led to today's sponsor function of beauty we both use function of beauty i have used functional beauty like exclusively for over a year now the first time that i tried out functional beauty was with a youtuber's discount code so basically it's a fully customizable shampoo and conditioner you can get different products like added on like a hair mask or a leave-in treatment or a hair serum i use the leave-in

choose what fragrance you'd like you can choose what color you'd like you can do your name on the bottle i got a very cute color i believe it's called silvery blue and it's so pretty i also got the scent isn't she bubbly which i believe is their new like christmas scent which smells really good i feel like functional beauty has been very beneficial for my hair it's getting long and that's always

beauty for sponsoring this video all right guys so in honor of my mustache still existing we don't know when it's leaving we were facetiming bobby last night if you don't know bobby jenny's gonna put a picture of him on jess's face he had the idea of me dyeing it christmas colors so we thought we would do that in today's vlog he said it as a jerk and we were like actually that's it's a great it's a great idea so we're probably going to do that before it disappears into being just a distant memory we have some hair dye waiting for us at target we ordered it to make sure it didn't sell out and we're going there to get it but first coffee yes there's an australian cafe apparently it may be permanently closed or it may be open we're gonna go see but we needed some aussie vibes today yes let's go   that was a fail no luck but that's okay let's go get your coffee a true a true coffee and then target to get your little die oh yeah   we didn't make it to an australian cafe but this cafe had a flat white which it's australian australian it's popular in australia though that's where i first had it so i'm actually googling is flat white australian because i would say yes yes it is the earliest documented references to the beverage date back to australia in the mid 1980s cheers to the men's dude to australia cheers to ozville land down under i don't want a lot for christmas there is just one thing i need yeah i just want this mustache to look so fresh and clean i should write music good idea i'm not sorry we have our tools this is what we picked out from target one day color yes this is what we were able to get originally we wanted red and green to do a little maybe some stripes and we were like okay maybe red and white we can do a little candy cane action do some stripes that way and then there was only a silver but the silver was out of stock unavailable at all the targets in our area and we could only get our hands on the red still festive still a vibe red mustache i think it'll work color spray things usually have a large impact radius so because of that we have decided that we are going to use some tape some masking tape we're going to mask my mustache and protect my face with masking tape super professional and just spray her on let's work our way up to the bathroom let's do it hello say hello to yourselves everybody hello we're in the mirror so you can see what we're doing and we can see what we're doing this is probably the dumbest way of how to do this but you know when enrolled am i right that doesn't make any sense look at the artwork guys that's let's take a nap now not yet   this is true art looking good all right guys we're still good my face still looks amazing clearly it may stain your skin yeah it's fine do it for the block three two one oh no oh my gosh guys i have lip liner look at that my gosh oh no yo i'm freaking ronald mcdonald i look like a really bad clown outfit literally about up here too like a little blush this looks so bad   this one's really poorly thanks a lot bobby bobby this is all your freaking fault all right we should really try and get this off at this point yes like christmas vibes happened but this christmas vibes need to be done real quick looking great oh my gosh jessica i'm really committing to this christmas thing rudolph the red nose reindeer oh gosh you know this reminds me what doing theater shows in high school when i was the scarecrow there's totally not a picture on the screen right now that jenny has just put up getting that off my face oh i bet all right it's off good work everyone good job everybody i'm proud of everyone who worked on this project me jess jenny you ready to shave this sucker off   okay my wife here is done no absolutely not all right look at this guy look at your freaking boy dude okay i'm a new man everybody so we've been making a few updates to the studio and i think it's looking good to be honest it looks like a lot cooler than when we last showed you yes sorry the guitars are on the floor i actually want to hang those up the guitar on that wall and the ukulele might fit there which could be cool because that's like a skinnier part of the wall and whatever we'll decide that another chair is going to be there so we'll have two chairs kind of like that and that tape will be in the middle but for now we only have one but we added the uh the sound treatment right there so i'm really really happy with it i had to like cut it all out and like get the corners right to make sure everything fit the tops have a little cut you did like the plugs in the wall yeah there's actually one right here that i'm really i'm really hyped about i got one really nice right there and then i did the the back of the doors these i didn't even need to put tape on because i ended up cutting them so perfect that they just like all fit right in i just freaking nailed it and like measured it so good because your boy but yeah that's what we're doing so let me hang up the guitars and stuff but i think it's looking great what an interesting vlog i had no idea that this is where our vlog was gonna go for this week i had basically no idea as well except for the first half i was gonna surprise you and then all of a sudden bobby was like diet red christmas and now we're here we appreciate you watching this far if you've got this far you're a real one

on gas just the typical super crazy exciting things that you do on a road trip yeah i'm excited to get there it is colder temperature update it's 62 fahrenheit outside two degrees celsius so it's getting cooler by the second all right the lighting's atrocious so we'll see you later we made it oh my word we made it oh my word what the heck are you doing bro what the heck bro you're freaking us

rest of the world so last night we just kind of hung out with them i know we did a little b-roll and stuff we just got some dinner stuff like that but uh yeah today is a fun day right now we're just going on a walk and getting some coffee and hanging out gonna get some food whatever just chilling but then but then is when what are we doing babe we're going to the snow there's this place near where our friends live it's basically this like man-made tubing hill and it also has like this big igloo with real snow inside so they're like pumping out snow onto this hill and it's like pretty dope and we're very excited we're gonna go grab a hot drink and walk around a big lake right yeah just going on a little walk   so but how cute were those baby ducks   though   look at this content oh this is key this is toast worthy we love this for you guys feeling great look at them turtles you actually look good right now it actually got a little tilt on the camera yeah you look good yeah all right you ruined it for me what it is guys drive into the snow oh oh wait we don't really know what it is an oasis but yes sir it's the man-made snow do you hear what i said it's an oasis it's an oasis i'm pretty clever i was homeschooled so but yeah we'll see what it's like hopefully it's a vibe hopefully we have fun hopefully we get some cute instagram pictures and chatting literally in the car ride behind us they're in the car behind us and we are um just hoping for a good old time we're gonna have a blast hot drinks it is in the 50s yeah fahrenheit so nice and crisp nice and florida chilly it is i'm just waiting to get the snow to you know try and get a little bit of that winter christmas spirit in my soul that christmas um okay we are one minute away all right guys this is the moment of truth on like if this is going to be real real and legit or if we got a hood with some photoshop photos on the internet snowcat ridge that's what it is there it is   all right guys we're inside i made everyone pause and not turn around because i wanted to get the reaction three two one     oh   dude that was so funny he's like you guys just gotta scoot to get off the thing like oh crap we're all just like moving   is this the goodbye is this it i don't like goodbye we'll see you soon we're not that far away just skip hop and jump across alligator alley yes there is a road called that we're waiting to you know sleep in our guest suite oh yeah everyone is claiming the guest room as their room this person thinks it's theirs but we all know we all know that it's actually sebastian cancelled sorry yeah you're watching this all right they're they just threw you under the bus i'm sorry yeah we all know whose room it really is yeah milo's lovely bro i'm so glad we did this thanks for making the time oh dude thanks for letting us stay with you guys bye oh love you that wraps the weekend a little catch-up trip we had a lot of fun didn't we we did it was very refreshing for us they lived really close to us in l.a we went to the same church and then they moved out to florida at a similar time so it was refreshing to like go see them chad has become one of my closest friends genuinely have been missing my la friends because i don't know when we left i guess didn't realize how close i was to so many of my friends out there so it's really cool being able to see them and spend time with them again and stuff i had mentioned it but like i'm going through a weird mental season fog again which is a little weird so just trying to like i guess take precautions surround myself with the right people and do the right things that um take breaks when we need to and stuff like that so this has been really good for that we prescribed him sleep eating the right things and just um getting enough sleep and all the rest surround yourself with the things and people that like really encourage you and like bring out the best in you another thing that just and i were just talking about on the drive to this snow place was i can tell the difference in myself and how my day goes like if i spend time with god in the morning and like reading and stuff and if i don't and neglect doing that like there's a clear difference in my day which is like pretty wild i don't know it's an interesting thing that we're trying to navigate and we don't fully know like what the reasoning is for this like new sprung cloud cloud yeah there's just a lot going on with essentially like two moves like moving to florida then we finally moved into the house and there's just a lot of change and just like i don't know settling into this like new life it just has not i guess emotionally or mentally been what i was expecting so maybe that change has been pretty i don't know let me know your thoughts on it if any of you guys have kind of experienced the same thing with like a significant change and how it's affected you and stuff i would love to hear you guys thoughts on that it's also been interesting for me like la was a new place for me and then like moving to florida is like a new start again and so it's been interesting and difficult for both of us but i'm glad we did it me too thank you guys for all of the love and the support and we appreciate you uh following along on the journey we love you guys hope you're having a good december so far we'll see you in our next vlog peace out from jess and gabriel county you you did it i did oh wow actually can't believe that it has been four years like if you think about four years we've been married for four years that's   wild yeah was that fun my hi mike another day another vlog let's go baby oh freaking step it up baby let's freaking go yeah so something very exciting is happening which i'm pretty sure you already know about we've already shown it but i've shown it i don't think we've shown it on jessie gabriel this is something very special very good really big deal very kind very christmasy very get to the point i got him a star wars advent calendar if you haven't seen star wars legos advent calendar i showed it on my channel but basically every day he gets to build a new little lego thingy or a new character i currently did what was it day 14. today's the 14th when we're filming this so four days away from our anniversary what till we m marriage you're watching this on the 19th if you're a real one and watch it the day we post which means yesterday was the 18th our wedding anniversary four-year wedding anniversary which is wild because some people have been watching since like the wedding yeah that's crazy we thought we could show them the um puzzle we started a little bit yes we did the whole border and then we did that but then look at all of the piles like there's a lot going on here the groundwork has been set for a very successful christmas puzzle also this is actually hilarious we got a gift today which is one of the homesick candles such a cool brand if you want to check them out they have candles from like different all the different states in america and then they have some overseas ones so we got sent this australia candle which i love and i've needed a new one it was a gift and this is what the card says dear jess and gabe just want you to know even though you are not here in australia we have you in our hearts i love you both so much from from nobody someone so i'm guessing it could be like a family member there was no name on like the receipt that came through whoever sent it if you're watching this thank you very thoughtful we appreciate it we want to thank the person and we love you i think we love you too we're starting our day out right everybody by going to target i can't get my eyes off that truck why is it so skinny this is the most confusing thing i've ever seen in my life it's about to move what can you guys see that why is it so skinny what the heck all right so we're going to target for one specific thing do you know what that is you know what that is they could definitely guess if they watch our instagram stories all right guys take ten seconds to guess nine and while you're here click the like button and subscribe six before the countdown i need that one freaking ladder climbing santa claus thing but first cheers no coffee it was but first coffee coffee coffee we need some coffee in our system one because that was atrocious two you should have seen the conversation that we just had with our editor a one-way conversation because we don't she doesn't talk back to us when we're giving her notes while filming but this is what happened all right jenny this transition better be freaking lit jenny this transition is going to be live is like going to be the new trend this is the transition that changes the game for our for our entire fan base jenny i know you're really impressed we haven't even done it yet jenny has a lot of patience we try to make her laugh jenny you are amazing jenny you are just so you're you're the second best editor i've ever met jenny i would go as far behind jess okay right now i'm kidding behind me guys we're pulling into target right now the line seems long target's just lit i guess anyway the reason why i turn this on is because we figured out who the culprit was the candle culprit mama bella aussie mom mom mum mum classic anyway guys target that's totally not our target jingle target this is the dilemma you come to target and you don't expect to spend money on certain things but then you realize that like you kind of need christmas socks and christmas slippers yes yes yes so it's this thing and it like climbs up and it does a little tune goes up and down so we're gonna go set that up good shopping day don't want my christmas shopping cheers cheers cheers we got it we're uh we're this were yep so let's go home that was terrible back home and it's time to set up the santa our greatest investment yet it just hasn't felt like christmas yet this year i think now is when it finally feels a little bit more like christmas the only thing is his face is facing the other way oh that's the only problem so it's like who's santa we don't know we'll never see his face do you like it   guys it really it's christmas time i think it really started to feel like christmas now i'm really glad we bought it one of our better christmas purchases yet this is the first time that it's hitting me that it's like oh our anniversary is wait four years this week i feel like they'll still be able to hear the santa it's been like 30 minutes since we filmed that clip and he's still coming he's loud he's not like a silent santa no i actually can't believe that it has been four years like if you think about four years we've been married for four years that's why four years ago we were all in australia when i was 22 and you were 20 and we were just living the dream i was so young so young and naive your family were there my family were there it was like the first time everyone was meeting and it was like such a happy time and within those four years we've only been able to travel back to australia for six months get married two and a half years until jess gets her residency finally get to travel back to australia and go twice within the six month period pandemic but now everyone can't travel no i know it's not like we're just moping around like we can't everyone else can travel yeah it's the whole thing it's just so weird that when you put it that way like who would have thought you know what i mean like when we were married i never would have we're supposed to be back there now i know one of my best friends getting married very soon i'm one of her bridesmaids and so that's why we were meant to be back there but it just it didn't work out i'm gonna be there in spirit she's shipping me the bridesmaid's dress i keep praying and telling myself like the first few months of 2021 surely we're gonna come back yeah i hope so man but you know we'll see but happy anniversary happy anniversary i'm gonna go get the legend album good idea darling if you guys don't remember this wedding book just surprised me with it how long like two years ago 2018 maybe okay well this is when i shared my dad like the reveal wow this one's great seeing the faces my sister my best friend gabe's sister gabe's sister-in-law when i showed them the dress for the first time this is when i showed my brother for the first time and he broke down it was so sweet this was a great moment it's a great photo because all of the bridesmaids are out there like he didn't see me at all but this is when we prayed together which was really special wow this is my favorite the best page in the whole thing there's just so much emotion so i'm smiling at cape gabe's crying and my dad's crying yeah i just love this page it's great now we're married and happy and taking place tell us babe there you go a little trip down memory lane memories really like mess me up i know they make you a mercy this also i feel like just has a lot of significance because it was like we were also moving me over to the state so just so much was going on here and then like we haven't really gone back a lot and so anyway we are happy jenny way anyway we are incorporating jenny into every vlog now so if you don't like it oh well jenny's part of the freaking squad now anyway guys we just thought anniversary for the sake of the mems let's just go through it a little bit i really love it like going through it makes me so happy that should be a tradition we go through the photos always keep it in our memory no i'm i think our tradition should be like watching the wedding video oh babe no i can't do the wedding video it makes me cry i know i don't feel like crying right now okay last order of business i wanted to take a really nice good christmas photo you know because christmas vibes there was this really cool house that we passed the other day that's like crazy lights it's just sick and there's people taking photos in front of it and stuff like that and i was like this would be a great spot to take a good photo with jess what a better time to do it than right now the sun is like kind of setting so we still got a little bit of light but the christmas lights will be on it's kind of perfect so we're gonna go there take a nice little christmas pic and uh season baby we made it we made it merry christmas baby let's go take a photo then shall we and music is playing this is season we're not trying to get copyright strikes so you know we'll cut to a really sick b-roll that

so seb is coming he's landing in two hours you know what that means we need to run to target right now if you saw my instagram story you saw that the valentine's day section is already up what the heck but we thought it'd be really funny just to get him a bunch of valentine's day you did i want to get him like a little welcome gift or something anyway on roots should we get him a fresh pair of underwear just like get him some undies and socks or something that would be so funny because we know you'll need it here's some underwear what do we think of these we should totally have one of these chocolate roses on his pillow sev is such a star wars key so this is a beautiful beautiful valentine's day oh that is so fire he's gonna love that dude omg this best friends this is it and then i can keep this part and he could keep that we need to get there this is amazing okay i'm back in the car gabe had to run back in really quick because we were loading everything into our boot and long story short we forgot a water bottle and i was not about to shoplift and leave with a water bottle that we didn't pay for he's coming back now with our paid for water bottle what's up shoplifter no shoplifting in this family you're here i would have felt so guilty walking away i wouldn't have been able to do it yeah for sure okay guys we picked it guys we did the right thing seb you better enjoy this water what we've gone through to get you this freaking water dude we're back home and jess just pointed out that this moment that we have right now it's our last moment of pure silence for the next two weeks because sebastian is coming to mess things up we're just gonna take it in just take in the peaceful vibes while we can he's gonna watch this and be like wow we're just like bagging on him like crazy it seems like his flat is a little delayed yes we just look it up so we thought let's eat a little bit snack time yes and then we need to set up his room and basically we do need to set up the room go and um   i'm just repeating what jess just said so i catch myself doing that all the time when i watch a video back i'm like why do i repeat everything gesture said it's a thing i'm telling you like call it out in this vlog jess will say something and i'll be like yeah then that and just repeat the exact thing i do it if i also have an additional thought after the fact like it's just yeah we need to set up the bed i go yeah we need to set up the bed and then we have to really turn around and go so i'll let kind of repeat what she just said to continue on sebastian will just be like outside the conversation listening i'll be like it's such a nice day today yeah oh it's such a nice day today ted we love you though we've been missing making fun of you yes we can't wait and we're so excited to have you here we diy this last night guys how good does it look it actually it came out great all those little bubbles that we were worried about left looks like a professional came and did it but really it was just your boy and your girl right it didn't have this film on it it was completely see-through because when we were building it we're like we're gonna have this beautiful big luscious tree that blocks it so from the inside you can see green you have natural light but it's blocked from the outside and as you can see the tree is about that tall so we didn't want the people next door to be able to see in see seb showering and this is our first official guest who's going to be using this shower so we needed you know a little something so we put this little film on it looks great for us yes that's what we left as like bobby and seb made this big load of yes we put it on the wall for him this is not your room actually my this isn't your room how many times you have to tell you dude see i just repeated the thing i repeated what you said you were like my this isn't your room and i was like i was doing room okay i asked him like one snack he likes and this was his snack of choice got the water bottle that we paid for the water oh boy did we pay for that one definitely emotionally and physically where do you want to put this that needs to be on the bed that just kind of ruins the vibe a little bit yeah but like it's still it's more of a vibe now if we're being honest uh jenna yeah honestly should be a sorry jenny um edit oh that's really funny where's your next larger sorry jenny sorry jenny sorry jenny oh beautiful look at that i tucked it into the pillow vibes i think we're ready to go yeah let's do it let's do it baby jess is changing things up well see i stood here and i was like okay this is what seb's going to see and all i can see is that like what's his name from monsters inc it's solid slowly okay then do you want to put it here like with this thing yeah like that okay because then you can still see the cute milo you blend into the room so well this is our last moment of silence let's just take it in what what seb landed five minutes ago so we decided it would be a great idea to really i wanted to dress up in a suit but we just didn't have time for that because we were already running late but um we're gonna stand there with a little sign that says bobby in his merch hopefully we can get to the spot and be there before him so he sees us as he's walking out so with that said i'm gonna stop rambling on and talking so long and just letting this clip drag on and on and on and i mentioned it i didn't mention that you guys are gonna vlog but i was going to vlog yes i'm here what up bro here i'm tired let's

call myself jacob what are you wearing jake uh socks and shorts and a green t-shirt current relationship status single and ready to mingle and and ready to talk to nice people there we go good answer good answer dude this is a mature vlog i love it we're getting a little juicier all right juicing hit me with the juice when was your first kiss sixth grade what wow my dog i know sixth grade in the back of uh we had like a wednesday night like youth group i got you seven you know i went to a private school in sixth grade transferred in yeah and we had like a wednesday night like youth group thing and that's where i was like yo like the babes you did it at youth group well it wasn't yeah it was like this was like youth group but there was like an after school hangout before youth go right to school everybody hung out you know so i was like oh i'm holding the girl's head it's like oh oh my god yeah crazy but i was a wild what 12 year old how many girls have you kissed spitting girls kiss i i might need a sec on that oh you do not like it i would say in the ballpark of 10. wow my dog maybe like 12. i've kissed one girl in the past oh two girls since i graduated from college okay so you know you're a good boy the majority of those were like in high school i was you know i was just a kid i was just a kid yeah what is your ideal best day i like to go to breakfast actually bro can we go on a date yeah bro let's go get breakfast i like an a.m like you go to breakfast or maybe like walk to the beach or something just like kick it dude you just won so many girls hearts right now hey i'm just telling you i'm right here can you guys question me next i'm sorry sam kitty's a few extra dms you've been running low on dms lately what are three things you look for in a lady someone who is who's like selfless in their approach to how they interact with other people and i mean like like someone who like thinks of others first and i think you see that like when you go out to eat you know like to strangers i think it's really important people that they don't need to per se like be kind to or think of and be considerate of somebody who is like who has integrity which i guess is a hard thing to look for but i think that's something you learn over time like somebody who like sticks to their word and has integrity and kind of like is who they say they are and who they say they want to be yeah and someone who's just smoking hot bro hey there i don't know that those are the top three first thing that come to mind yeah dude good answers right the ladies watching name one strength and one weakness i think i'm someone who is like very honest and i'll always tell you what i think and also sometimes just like hey easy like easy sometimes i will just be very straight up with things and i think there are times where it's wise for me to be a bit more like delicate than i am really it's something i work on but something i want to continue working on i was like if i was in this person's position how would they react to me saying this even if it's not how i would see it right you know to try to like put myself in another position yeah outside of the vlog lots of girls are gonna from this i'm just saying i'm just saying sorry jenny we have two questions left all right two more questions would you ever date a fan how come you guys have never done this for me you're like setting him up for success i've never had this ever within our three to four years of vlogging you guys have never set me up on a date or whatever and then this guy comes along and he gets like the bachelor treatment okay sebastian you're just mad that he's answering the questions well yeah he is i am jealous you're a good guy it's an interesting question i would say yes i would but not if they were weird but i wouldn't date another person if they were weird too yeah if they were cool yeah yeah okay last question good answer wow will you be accepting dms off this i mean i'm always accepting the internet these always open later i mean they always at least make it to my request you know i check those like once every two weeks i'm really bad at getting back to dms for like how not many dms i get you know what i mean it's always open guys and he's gonna be better answering back everybody all right everyone well jacob matthew okay   round of applause ladies and gentlemen right good work everyone good work please oh good transition everyone was that as scary as you thought exactly as scary as the time maybe a little less scary than i thought pretty chill right yeah yeah

jake and say bobby and chad sorry to be the bearer of bad news but you did actually get some bad news yesterday we did not what do you want to be hearing nothing hoping for sup family oh cuddles my mind i think she loves you more than she loves me another day another vlog how long do you think we'll say another day another vlog for i don't know has it gotten old let us know should we start another day another vlog i don't think so like is it cheesy now another day another one of the vlog we stopped saying some other things we still say but first coffee we kind of stopped doing that anyway thing we're just cut to like anyway anyway anyway i feel like there's been a lot of phases in our vlogs like remember you would do the juju every vlog oh gosh that was when we lived in l.a and we had a parking garage that we could safely film in you used to get cameron all the time yeah when we would go flames that was like really early on the main one that people always talk about is sweet but that wasn't like for the vlog that wasn't for vlog that was just stop hitting that was just a phase my parents still do it i think that's how i started saying it because my parents taste hey sweet sweet oh sweet she responded to hey sweet oh that's that's how adorable guys oh so cute anyway i got a vr headset recently and it is so fun and i've been playing a little bit and then jess is always like i want to play it too but you haven't let me play it because i wanted to film her playing her first game because it's going to be hilarious you're looking at this it's beautiful interior design hey guys welcome to the land down under okay oh baby calm down calm down i can see them in my view though i know i know so what you're gonna do is you're gonna click those the like the square in the middle there no no no with the point your little controller to it no no no not that the square the through this nine dots down on that bar click that uh uh yeah now collect the mini golf one that's really nice right whoa so now you're there hole in one no way no way you just got a freaking hole in one on your first one now look you can see the whole island around you this is freaky oh oh a little too much love this way yeah yeah and then the boundary will come up to prevent you from going too far oh my gosh that is so cool i don't know where you are oh too much too much juice baby wow good job way to go babe way to go high five oh good job how was it whoa it's bizarre how real it feels when you're in it yeah it's insane you just want to keep walking but i i had i knew that i was near the mirror because the lines kept coming up so it has little cameras so we can see what's going on around the room so then you map a little boundary so we have a boundary going around the whole room so we can walk in this whole main area here and then when you get close to the edge while you're playing it doesn't show up on the screen recording but if you get close to the edge it'll be like a grid that pops up here that tells you like you're getting close to the edge so you can't walk past it and you stay safe so you're never going to like trip over the stairs or something like that that was so much fun how great was it i can't believe we haven't let you play that guys guys if you want a full video vr let us know we'll need to find like a funny game because i feel like i was just standing there doing that there's like scary games where you go through where you're like going through a maze or something and stuff is jumping out at you i'm pretty sure that's a thing or even the ones where it feels like you're walking like on a tightrope like i want to do stuff like that guys if you want to see a full vr video let us know i just wanted to do that for a vlog because it's super fun i'm telling you guys it doesn't stop it never stops just just massages milo all day   before i hit record she's like welcome to the doggy massage oh paula you are a good dog he's like hello why'd you stop hello everyone and welcome to a brand new segment called drive through musical he says it's actually called drive-through drama i don't know why we decided to start this but uh we were going through the drive-through and i was like let's tell a story of some drama that we had in the past because the internet seems to like drama so you know views we are such dramatic people we are actually the least i think half of like what youtube is we don't work with because we just like we can't capitalize on any drama in our life if there's drama we're just like bye bye dramas coming at me the first episode of drive through drama is with gabriel everyone welcome give real quantity to the show thank you everybody appreciate it sorry please hold your applause no please come out come on oh please yeah no do you have a dramatic story to tell i have a silly story i mean it was it was kind of dramatic at the time for being hollywood middle school 14 13 i think i was 13. i was juicy i was 13. i think i've told you this story before it's when i not really made fun of them but like passively made fun of a kid for wearing a pink shirt oh my gosh when i was young and naive and i was a homeschool child i hadn't been out much you were young and stupid yeah i had never worn pink i don't know why up to that point i wear pink all the time now like i love it i'd lean over to the kid and he was like a cool kid and he was wearing a pink shirt and i was like isn't pink a girl color why wearing pink pink is a girl color gabriel the funny thing is is my parents got upset at me and they're like you're so dumb for saying that they made me like go and apologize to the kid face to face in person they were like you're gonna pray with him and apologize and like you prayed with him i did this is the dramatic part he didn't care he was like oh yeah i forgot that happened when i talked to him apparently someone else heard me say it was a tattletail and told on me for him so it was a whole thing i don't remember all the details but i hear the story lots of a lot of the time because family members and stuff if something happens or i'm wearing pink they go huh it wasn't pink a girl color though pink is a great color to wear it's an amazing color especially when you get like a nice like sam salmony pink oh wow that was a great first drive through drama i'm gonna have to think of a good juicy one i know i think this was on the spot guys episode one was on the spot i had to pull something out and that was the first thing i thought of out of all the years that you lived in l.a and you know that's like drama city that's the first thing that came to you their stories but like i'm not trying to like put other youtubers on blast like that's not we don't have to do that but i'm sure there's stories that we can remember that aren't putting anyone i'm blast yeah we'll have an internal conversation and then you guys will hear of it on our next episode of drive through drama okay we've got our drinks we are heading to a store because gabe has decided he wants a pair of jeans i am testing the waters i have recently decided i need to spruce up my style a little bit my wardrobe and i just don't wear jeans they're not as comfy as like sweatpants and joggers and if you get the right sweatpants and joggers you still look good i have a story that's why i was tired okay all right i'm just making excuses we all know for a while gabe has not been a fan of jeans you did play jeans when we like started dating and then you like just went like sweatpant life listen i was trying to make moves with an australian girl that i met and i was trying to impress her and have her fall in love with me and i was trying to look good i wanted to come and tell this story because i think it's hilarious oh my gosh we had you no no no just let me let me i wasn't really part of this conversation that much we had jake in seven town and we're in the car our last day in town and they all decided to start rating themselves no jake and said were rating each other yes it was jake and seth they were rating each other one through ten and then and then gabe joined in and then i joined in because the conversation was too good but it was so funny for me to just sit here silent just listening to them all right each other and like the reasons why it was such a pure innocent fun little thing it was just funny so they decided to do another round of rating style and i will say oh i wasn't part of that i was driving gabriel you were driving the whole time okay okay whatever the winner of the style category was actually sebastian yes and the reason was i voted him winner too because he wears jeans and stuff that was like one of the reasons and then all of a sudden gabe's been looking at jeans listen guys listen i'm trying to look good all right oh babe you're really on the bus that you just like tossed me right under there a few buses are going it was just such a funny thing to witness in my head i'm like gabe randomly wants jeans now but then i remembered that he didn't win the style ranking the other day because seb wears jeans anyway long story short we're gonna go grab a pair of jeans no we're not making any turning around right now no luck no luck in november because you had a bad day oh we're back home guys and i'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but we didn't get the jeans there weren't jeans i'll probably buy them online they just didn't have a good selection there anyway anyway anyway well actually not a positive anyway speaking of bad news we did actually get some bad news yesterday we did very unfortunate news which is not uh not what you want to be hearing nothing news we were hoping for basically the travel ban in australia has been extended for the entire 2021 uh which just means that um my family definitely can't like come here come here we were very hopeful that like they would come for christmas like this december that was the plan since we kind of started building the house and everything is that your first christmas my family will be here obviously they couldn't travel and so like it's okay next christmas it'll be fine but yeah we just heard yesterday australians can't travel until 2022. so i don't know what that looks like with us being able to go in as far as i know we can still go in as i'm a citizen and he's married to me we need to double check that we can also then leave like i don't know how that works since i'm an australian citizen yeah that like travel ban works for me too there's like a lot that australia is doing like a two-week mandatory quarantine in a hotel that you have to do in my mind we will go to australia this year hopefully i would love to just like stay there for a few months but right now it's so hard to get flights i know a girl who had a flight and then it just got cancelled like they didn't tell her why or like when anything's gonna come back up the whole thing is just difficult yeah the whole situation is weird but yeah i don't know we're optimistic about it and um we're hoping for the best and praying that we can see justice family soon everyone is going through still still going through it so it's not like we're the you know only people that are like oh you know poor us everyone's going through it everyone's going through that's just a little update on our uh situation definitely didn't mean to just bring the mood down we're optimistic about it and we're very uh we know that like god's plan is happening no matter what but that is just like obviously on my mind 24 7 especially because i just heard it yesterday i'm just like thinking about it so much i'd love to be back with my family yeah if you guys are watching you guys yeah they watch everybody janine stop crying we're safe and healthy and together so we are grateful hope you guys are all doing well i know a lot of you are probably going through the same thing that we are going through not being able to travel to see family we love you guys thinking and praying if you guys thinking of and praying for that's what i meant and i was rethinking it i'm praying of you guys i'm praying of you guys anyway hope you guys enjoyed this vlog stay safe and we'll see you in the next one peace out from jess and gabriel our friends might be staying another night and they don't know we're doing this they're gonna come back and be like huh this is really weird should we not tell them no but we should just like see what happens yeah   another day welcome back ladies and gentlemen and we are here with a segment none other than the now infamous critically acclaimed award-winning drive-through drama except we are almost at the drive-through window because that was like the shortest line yeah typically when we go to the drive-through this line is super long so we're like kill two birds with one stone why is that a saying it's pretty i know what it means it's not very nice kind of dark when you actually think about it i think you say it like off the cuff without the actually thinking about the meaning yeah we don't want to kill two bets but if you're going to do it with one stone no anyway we're trying to be efficient and while we wait we can do a drive-through drama segment except i we're next to order so we got to keep this quick okay so i was trying to think like what is this week's drive-through drama and i thought let's talk a little bit about like our celebrity encounters what's yours mine is one angela from the office her real name is angela we were at a restaurant that was near our uh place in la and she held the door open for me she was like leaving and i was walking in and she like walked out before i was walking up and she like held the door open we then saw her again at starbucks that's when i was with you the second time is when we were like it's dangerous for the office and you're like love you in the office by the way and she was like oh thank you so much she was so cute yeah she was really nice that was a cool moment if you know me very well you'll know that my favorite show without question is monk so there's a character in monk we'll put him up here his face is on my face right now right johnny long story short we think that he must have lived near us in los angeles because several times when gabe would walk to go get a coffee he would walk past randy disher yeah and sometimes he'd be walking his dog did you ever say hey no we passed each other on the sidewalk once and i just like nodded to him but i wasn't like hey by the way my wife loves you dude if you had gotten a selfie you would have been like husband of the year what's your drink what's your drink baby we get this every time it's different you have different rooms his celebrity encounter would always make me so jealous because it was several times he would walk to the coffee shop and i've walked to the coffee shop with you several times too but like i never saw him i never got a chance to say hi anyway long story short he saw a character from my favorite show several times and i just never did and i what the heck my story was um very quick and similar we didn't like meet them but at the restaurant that you saw angela for the first time we also saw justin bieber and hailey beaver yeah and my story with that was we felt so bad basically they were sitting just trying to eat their food and obviously they're like so massive so everyone's kind of staring and then they just tried to walk out and leave and there was so many paparazzi outside and we were like walking out behind them it was so insane i just felt bad yeah i did feel bad it was like they couldn't even walk to their car because they were surrounded so that's our celebrity edition of drive-through drama that wasn't really dramatic we're pulling up to the window all goes though but we said it last time we're not really the most dramatic people but you know we have a few stories for for the vlog you know i'd love to know like any celebrity encounters that you guys have had i find them so interesting my first coffee let's have a drink so we are headed back to our florida condo it's where we were living before we moved into this house we always wanted it as an investment property yeah some people asked if we still had it because we sold our one in la and then the condo we were in which is a small one bedroom here in florida before we moved in we were like okay let's hold on to that one and try and use that as an investment property and then you know try and find a renter and stuff like that we let some friends stay there because they were in town to let them stay there now that they have left it's all clean yeah and ready to go today we are going to take pictures the bridge here's a fun florida thing we have a bunch of canals it's called the intercoastal it's basically a waterway that leads out to the ocean but you have these bridges that go over them and as you'll see in a moment the bridges lift up so boats can pass by but then us people in cars normal pedestrians get stopped and you just gotta wait i always thought it was cool when i first came to florida because i don't know if they have these in australia i've not where i'm from anyway i've never seen them you know gabe's used to it so he's always like oh the bridge but i was like oh this is so cool like the bridge goes up oh it's lifting up right now anyway just in case you've never seen one of these before it just goes fully in the air yeah and then it goes back down and then we drive over it so we're going to the condo we're going to take some professional pictures of it because we don't have any and we thought that we'd also show you the condor jess did a little tour on her channel of that condo we never did anything so we're gonna do a little tour there take some photos show what we did it's a cool new personal i mean it is work but like personal project in the sense of it being not like entertainment work or social media work or any of that stuff it's like a just an eye kind of thing that we're that we're working on gabe and i are also both very into real estate we both really want to do a renovation property that sort of thing and so this is like exciting for us to do and it's cool to like i guess start that journey do it together there's a really good step one for us with like starting with this property that we already have just work on like i guess the process a little bit and then we're learning yeah learn a little bit and then step two is you know finding a new property and like seeing what the best one to invest in is and then probably do a renovation and share that whole story build that kind of like side business i guess and with that said we did we really talked that whole time we talked the whole time the bridge is now up which is if you live in florida you know how long bridges go for it janet hey jenny all right bye bridge with that said get the bell on baby we never say to get the bell on but if you want notifications for our vlogs uh that was a good opportunity that was a good opportunity to get the bell on so we made it to the condo our friends might be staying another night apparently so they left their stuff here so we're just we can just like move stuff around for the pictures yes and they don't know we're doing this but they're going to come back tonight because they're out working today they're going to come back and be like huh this is really good should we not tell them no we should just like see what happens yeah it's looking pretty good like i'm really happy with uh with how it's it's turning out like everything's looking pretty pretty pretty it is a very cute little vibe we never showed this before just because we didn't want to like show when we were living here we didn't want to show the location of the building or anything but we actually have a pretty freaking amazing view from here which is great an ocean view and i miss seeing this we were really lucky to find this place because a friend of ours owned it and when we were looking to get a place here in florida they were selling we just uh were able to purchase it off of our friends which was nice anyway we're gonna start taking some photos i already took a few photos of the outside of the building and stuff but um we're gonna start taking some photos of the inside kate's a great photographer he hasn't been you took pictures of our place that we were selling and it was really cool we'll show some of the photos after we're done taking them i think that'll be cool show you guys the pics that we got   we finished the bedroom and all of this side of things bathroom closet bedroom and now we kind of cleaned out this area and we are taking photos of the main area very cool we have finished shooting this whole place and the last order of business is good old jerry right here putting them back where he belongs right there i gave jerry to jess uh how long ago was that 2019 2018 2018 valentine's day he's stuck with us he's a sentimental one in our hearts oh well we're gonna get a little tour of it i mean you guys kind of already saw it but you guys you guys get the picture we've got a pretty cool view of uh very flat florida but the sun sets right over here and it's like gorgeous so if you walk out a lot of uh evenings it is just like very very pretty yeah a little half bath down that way it's very cute also dubs as my office dining living the kitchen barn door door um that we really love it's a very cute

tock guys we deleted that tick tock for a little bit if you don't know the history during quarantine like march april last year we went ham on tick tock i wouldn't say him but we posted some good tick tocks we posted enough for like a month and a half to like be considered a tick tockers i guess and then we just stopped we stopped we deleted the apps the reason why we actually started it was because we filmed some for a youtube video anyway we've redownloaded it we have posted a tick tock two days in a row should we make it a third day in a row challenge accepted guys if you're looking for more entertaining more content if you're looking for more of this follow us on tech talk okay so i think gabe wants to make a ticket i'm sure a lot of people have already seen the trend of like

something like that um we already did a part one of him like doing you know that it's fine so we want to do part two of him like being really proud and showing his lego guys my new set is so lit this

last picture you took before meeting each other this was yours that was a few days before we met each other but this one was actually after we had met like a few hours after we had met yeah i dropped jess off to hang out with another dude and then i was just sitting there on a balcony you know how bad that sounds just looking off the edge just like man i miss that girl okay it definitely wasn't that bad that he's making it out to be unseen photos of you and jacko come on unseen photos of me and jacka here is another i don't think it's completely unseen but like a rare photo i guess was that the day you guys met i think that was one of the first times like we hung out it was in new york at the convention that we went to at night we went and hung out so we like got dinner and like hung out or something like that either that was the day that we met and then we hung out at night or it was like the second or third day after we met i think i remember seeing this somewhere i don't know if one of you guys posted it to instagram i probably posted it on instagram but before we met i used it as a reference to try and figure out how tall you were really and i didn't know how tall jacqueline was creepy no i'm pretty sure that's a normal thing i'm kidding girls oh let me know this was another one this was right after we got married and we went to bondi beach and jaco came and we hung out next one a pregnancy test you guys did i'm gonna have to find it on my hard drive and i'll put a screenshot of it here but even though i was on the pill i was still you know things can happen so sometimes i'd get paranoid and be like okay i'm just gonna take it just in case it's not all birth control is 100 my period was really irregular so anyway sometimes i would just take one just to be like i just need you know yeah that's just yeah whatever yeah they got it every time i've taken one i mean it hasn't been a lot but if i've ever taken one it's been without gabe because like you want to like tell you in a special way yeah yeah every time she'll like be like here i took a pregnancy test and i'm like what okay okay what are you doing y'all's first trip to disney together y'alls first trip disney together yeah okay so i don't think we took a picture together the first time that we went to disney because we with like freshly seeing each other as influencers you get recognized and we were like i don't know i think we were way more paranoid about it then why didn't we take a photo together though i think at the start of our relationship i was very careful to like i wasn't taking a lot of pictures with you which is true now i regret we do have this snapchat memory of a video like of a snapchat that gabe made and you can see my hand in the corner and like my purse and i remember people were tweeting you and stuff going like oh my gosh there's like a girl with nail polish on in the in this video and they were trying to figure out who it was um daniel back at it again with the white vans wow that was so classic next one your honeymoon honeymoon here are two photos from our honeymoon yeah that was like right after we got married and we went to barn bay so one is from the just the mariner hotel room and then the other is by the pool and a little the hanging thing when you were building your house okay so this is the first one i have when we were like picking out all the materials and then that one january 25th of 2020. yeah it's pretty cool so just over a year ago and it was like just like the foundation and stuff very cool your handwriting versus gabe's handwriting on the same sentence gabriel does have very nice handwriting thanks ben appreciate it okay i will say this is not my favorite pen to write with okay it affects my handwriting yeah oh sure mine is on top justice is on the bottom a time you looked fine but you were actually really struggling this one was mine um we don't need to go into why yeah that one i can tell too by looking at that

myself too hard i got nauseous and threw up and then you came home and laid down and you're like whoa yeah like i was sitting up and then i went to lay down and then like the room literally started spinning like i couldn't look at one thing straight it was so weird and then i sat up and i was just like oh my gosh when i lay down i get dizzy i was just dehydrated and i was already like gonna drink a gatorade or something that was demanding what's traumatic you're just funny what you're making fun of me yesterday it was just funny it had to be that moment it was just so funny like i was

to say hi maybe come here come on okay very nice all right guys thanks so much for watching and we love y'all we'll see you in our next vlog peace out from jess gabriel conte i don't like this why did we decide to do it   another day another vlog welcome back all right guys facts the facts that we know it is another day and you're watching another vlog and it is on the channel that you know and love starting with the segment that you also know and love it's a bit of drive-through drama a bit of that drive-through drama you already knew it so today's been one of those days that's just like just a little stressful you know we're just putting out fires today for like four hours it's fine yeah it's fine it's whatever plans got shuffled absolutely completely and now here we are just trying to get out of the house for a second start our vlog and thought what a better way to live our life than a good old drive-through drama so enough with the chit chat and let's cut to the chit chat so i thought of um this story i'm calling this drive through drama paparazzi is fake if you guys know me pretty well you'll know that i'm pretty intrigued with like celebrities when i was younger i was a huge fan girl any like filming or anything i'm very into it so when i found this out i was like shook so here is the story fill the t oh actually you're getting passion tango i'll get a decaf latte please at all would you like to try that at around it no it's all right that's all it's fine homeboy is not trying to upsell me i respect the upsell i've been there jess always brags about her job at a place called pizza capers back in the day in australia and she was like the best upseller i knew how to get people to get a garlic bread and a drink for six dollars so i'm already dating gabe we're like a few months into dating and um on one of the trips i go to one of his interviews so at the end of his interview we're walking out and he gets told by his publicist so basically if you guys don't know a publicist is a person who sets up all the interviews and which was also news to me too magazine cover shoots and stuff that's all planned that's a whole job in itself is the press side of things and entertainment so that's you have to hire someone which i fully didn't know anyway so we are leaving the interview we walk out and i don't remember the man's name but there was like a paparazzi outside he takes the photos and stuff but then like you talk to him and then he's like oh uh you want to get a few more that was so weird for me to be like okay what paparazzi it's planned like i was so confused so we walk out and we fully like meet the guy first like shake hand like hi gabriel yeah and i was like what is this nonsense he's like all right so i'll be like over there and you you know walk back basically we did like a few shots of us like walking and then we'd go back and then we'd do it again and then go back but not all paparazzi is fake no there's like a threshold that you get to when you're like a list celebrity or whatever that like a bieber or something that everyone just wants to take they're not like hey i'm gonna be in beverly hills state like bieber's not doing that but i think for people wanting to grow their like publicity just their legitimacy in entertainment it's a whole thing like legitimacy and entertainment through like interviews that you get articles that have covered you different press outlets that have written stories about you and stuff it's a whole thing let me know if that's news to youtube because i remember figuring that out and just being like what probably a lot of paparazzi pictures that you've seen have been like planned and set up that's my drive through drama that's it guys i'll see you next time oh my gosh we're back everyone my say hi to the people come here say hi to your favorite people on the internet say hi no they're right here look they're right here right no okay okay all right guys we went on our drive got out of the house we de-stressed a little bit which was nice it was very needed we actually got test results back we got blood work done recently and we need to figure out a way to control our stress apparently yeah basically the main thing was for both of us with stress yes which we'll talk about in a second but uh that leads us to today's sponsor yeah thank you for sponsoring this video care of so if you don't know about carol basically they help find the right vitamins it's all personalized for you so the way we did it was that we went on the website and we took a really short quiz it kind of outlines your diet lifestyle different like personal goals that you have yeah it was very interesting we both got our results back and then they tailor a vitamin pack just for you so basically this is the stuff that i have that they gave me which is pretty sweet and it says made for gabriel it's all personal these are compostable which is really cool you can see we have our vitamins in there and we take them every day so the funny thing about the test results though is when we were going through the whole all the information with the doctor she basically asked us are you guys taking any vitamins i was like yeah taken care of never heard of it she asked for like all the information on all the vitamins we were taking and for both of us she was like yeah those are all really good she was really impressed with this whole um set up and with everything that we're taking which is good because it just shows that like the quiz gave us what we needed attacker i think a few of them in here kind of support stress others help like immune system and stuff like that so we've really been enjoying them so uh in the description below there's a link you can go take your own quiz fill out everything it'll send you your vitamins and a cute little personalized packet like this and you can use our code jess and gabriel 50 for 50 off your first month i saw something on tick tock that said if you have a bunch of pills to take you like bend over and it's easy to swallow absolutely not i tried all right guys i have five different vitamins here no oh my gosh it's so much easier just taking them normally really oh my gosh the lady was so confident you know when you like drink something or you spit and it goes like up into your note yeah that's what it almost felt like that was not the move can you not swallow them no that doesn't really work i told you i told you i flipped and told you guys tic toc was lying to you   oh my god my brain was so slow that i saw you i literally saw you we had eye contact for a little bit   dude i thought you were being sarcastic you laughing at the end you're like   okay so i thought that we would now talk about um you know just stuff that's been going on recently so a few weeks ago um something happened and it just it was it was i didn't remember what was going on all right guys we're not starting facing that way as you could tell those were disasters he was trying to make a butt joke gabe kind of jumped right into it before telling me that we got test results back and i forgot i realized there's a story attached yes well i guess it started with me a few months ago if you haven't seen the video on my channel long story short i stopped taking my birth control pill a few months ago i wanted to rebalance my hormones there was some stuff going on in my body so i wanted to get my hormones tested to do that you get your blood drawn and they come back with like all your levels so that's why i wanted to get mine done and then jess came to me and was like hey there's this place that i want to get my hormone tested at i think you should do it too because of the mental health stuff i deal with so we got our blood drawn and guess what everything pointed back to well you already mentioned it i know stress yes which is probably such a common thing for people basically we were told that we need to start controlling it otherwise it can be very dangerous later on in life even stuff like me feeling tired during the day i kind of got to a point where i was like well i guess this is just how everyone feels like this is normal yeah this is me i sleep eight hours i wake up and i'm tired that was a big one for me like a few things were low that was signs of like fatigue and tiredness and stuff like that most of my things all pointed back to stress anyway long story short it is i don't know it was just like really interesting to do that kind of thing and kind of figure out what what's wrong with us what's been going on but we're gonna keep working on ourselves working on our health deal handshake you saw it here first ladies and gentlemen figuring ourselves out and distressing guys i think we just came up with the greatest idea okay i've really been wanting to do a like facetime prank that's really big on like tick tock but i didn't want to do one that's already trending so what we decided to do is we were like oh it'd be really funny if it looks like a butt dial and we were like in a fight or something like wait when they pick up so what we're gonna do is we're going to actually pre-record some audio of jess and i freaking out basically freaking out acting that milo is like throwing up everywhere and like diarrhea and like it's everywhere and it's just like the audio so that way we can put the phone on the table and kind of show the reaction of the people and just like click play on the audio so it's like a perfect take every time as soon as they answer we just hit play and just see what see their reaction and then you end it going like oh dang it like you just realized that you're calling someone and you're like oh dang it and then you hang on this is the this is the deal this is the flippin deal dude these are going to be our takes of our scene of our scene oh my gosh oh my gosh yes yes yes i can't do it i can't do it with a camera on me i feel like i'm doing an audition or something no i'm turning this off you guys are gonna you'll see that okay anyway that was weird all right guys after several attempts i think we got a good one this is our 30-second acting scene where are you going just hurry come back down please hurry up where's the paper towel we got out of paper towels okay well can you please just get something it smells so bad please dude why would you let your diarrhea on the couch babe i did what the heck i didn't yes you did you were the one down here with him and then i came in savage i'm busy can you please just walk him outside please don't crack him across the rest of the couch who's all where's my phone where's my phone what do you think that one's pretty good we just need to try it on like one or two people and see if it works okay guys are you ready where are you going just hurry come back down please yes you did   that was good i'm not cut out for pranks man me neither it feels i feel nervous there's like that part in my soul that's like oh don't do that oh my gosh dude that was the greatest one we put on a scene no that was another that is great guys modern theater i really don't like this we are not turning into a prank channel the more we the more we do this the more it's just i'm sweating she was worried she was worried i don't like this why did we decide to do this it's funny but man i really don't like pranks where are you going just hurry up please i didn't really hear what you're saying but i heard the word diarrhea and i was like i feel like i'm getting games right that scared me so freaking bad oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i just sat here for like a minute i have a headache that gave me a headache i got nervous yeah that was that was nice let's not prank again no prank scares are good like i can go yeah and then you go ah and then it's like resolved and exciting or whatever where this is oh that was a lot but we called everyone we needed a call guys hope you enjoyed it you better have enjoyed it because if not that's disappointing because we just went through a lot we put people through a lot all right guys anyway we'll see you guys next time love you thanks for watching this video like subscribe all the things you already know love you guys we'll see you next time peace out from gabriel conte oh my god you just turned around and it said perth so you automatically know what state it's in oh my god just give it up you guys just give yourselves a round of applause for clicking on this video and for the fact that you're just about to have a good flipping time just give it up another day another vlog you're probably wondering this doesn't look like the bedroom why does it look like a hotel room well the answer is uh we turned our house into a hotel room we are currently in arizona um i had probably one of the most exciting things that i've ever worked on i had a photo shoot for it yesterday that is why we're in arizona so we thought this week we're going to do a little sit down and we thought you know what we are super smart and educated and i was homeschooled so i clearly know a lot we are from different cultures he is american i'm australian if you don't know we do like to kind of compete against that we've done a few like australian verse american things we have seen this going around um jira guesser yeah so we thought we would go head to head and see who wins yes tierra guesser is this game on online on the intel in in on the intellect it's a game on the intellect and only the most highest of iqs can play so basically it will plop you anywhere in the world or anywhere in the united states um and you basically just have to look around and figure out where you are like on google maps it drops you down yeah like so you just or all of a sudden in a google maps that just dropped you on a random pin what i thought we could do is do three different rounds so because we do need to go head-to-head we do need to go head-to-head this is fast so i thought we could do one round of the world one round of famous places and one round of the united states and you can see like that's two out of three yeah yeah right which one do we start with united states united states all right if i lose this one that's gonna be hilarious oh while we're here they don't know about the series because we hadn't mentioned it well i mean if you've seen it you know long story short really the podcast launched this week i started a podcast with two of my friends it actually is charting top podcasts on apple podcast which is sick that along with the whole series
