we're really anxious just to make sure that you're healthy babies healthy because last pregnancy you had gestational diabetes which was pregnancies already an emotional thing pretty breath but you're pretty if you guys don't know if you have gestational diabetes you have to eat super healthy and if you don't know gestational diabetes is only when you're pregnant so it has to do with your plus year placenta and it's totally random yeah so it's Savannah hates needles and yet to prick yourself what four times a day yeah so they send a your chance of getting it again or higher since you already had it but you don't have it with every single pregnancy most likely so a lot going on over here guys but if you're wondering I'm doing great I'm good I know all of you guys have been asking like how's Cole how's Cole doing I also do not like the end of the world if I have it but it would bury hold on oh yeah I was talking on me so yeah and they're like I see so many questions it's like how's Cole

everybody's doing well seriously it's raining in California which honestly almost never happens but it's a rainy day the girls are getting ready to do a picture because Savannah hasn't posted a picture on Instagram and literally social-media influencer most people like work so hard like like the best content like red print we're talking Lance Logan because like every guy's going on we've been stuck here all day so it's like babe today get ready it's the day so look how beautiful my like this Hey look matching outfits so posies got a little matching dress she's commercial kiss isn't looking the mirror that's probably very sanitary Wow and then look at Adams got a matching dress oh I love these shoes I love these shoes I know the reason why Savannah breeze pictures is because trying to get everybody ready it doesn't help that everybody's getting older and you guys are pretty much big just be full-blown sisters in the next five years Wow everybody right now go to Savannah's Instagram check this picture out that's gotta be cute kid okay nice okay so I feel like it's appropriate I can talk about this and not like a clique baby or like trying yeah I pack a lot come I like I like the media as like talking so much about it but I go a lot like social media influencers I don't want to talk about it and again maybe people are gonna start but we just felt awkward honest ignoring everything that's going on with kroehner buyers like we are honestly just listening to the CDC that's the center of Disease Control and who which is the World Health Organization and they're advising people here in the US I don't know where you live we live in California and pretty much everything's on lockdown essentially I mean not a hundred percent but everything's pretty much getting there so well not like it's like what can't go to like eat that says no event so you can go to I'm sure all of you guys know this about watching this but you can't go to like events I have more than 250 people I think is what they're saying yeah but basically they call the big it just feels like a little bio that's all getting close literally every every day we wake up with like every other passes I just got an email from everly school saying that they're having a meeting to see if her school's gonna close but like all other schools around us are closed now so yeah and we don't know we don't know where we stand on this just cuz like we you know we obviously don't have it we're praying for everybody affected and I know that this is like something terrible like waters trusting that this is something terrible we're trusting the people who are experts and so we have decided to just kind of stay in the house at least as much as possible in a training so we can't even go in our backyard and so what I'm seeing like cabin fever which you know almost upon us is better than getting sick or putting ourselves at risk and I think you know we would advise everybody out there no matter where you're at just to listen to the experts and the officials and you know we're so sorry anyone that you know is going through this or has it or anything we just felt really bad stuff and especially span to being pregnant they said that the people most at risk are the elderly that people who already have existing health conditions or the pregnant or pregnant women so again we know that there's a lot of people are watching who may be in that category so stay safe wash your hands listen to people don't go to places that have a lot of people yeah I mean and I can war not like you know the I would say that we're not like the panicky type or the people or like the type of guy overly worked up like we did we went out and we got like a bunch of food and water just you know to be safe but it's also tough because my family live in Florida again we only see them once every two three four months they're coming off of their spring break one week from now we're debating on if we want them to come just because they're gonna be flying yeah we don't know if that's smart just saying it we're almost staying quarantined in our house just until this passes or until you know yeah we don't have to let's see the decision that we're making you just for now just go Jamboree like stayin here we're gonna go places but just not places that have I feel like so much has come out in the past hours and one to two days that were just kind of like holding off for like a few days and like just like seeing what happens instead of putting ourselves at risk but without being so much family it was in Florida so we're like it's tough is like we want to see him so bad we haven't see him since like the beginning of January but is it putting out some what rescue guys are in this situation not it's my mom died in two little siblings and it was safe for them to be getting on a plane it was trending on Twitter also that they were thinking about banning travel from California in Washington yeah I don't know what's gonna happen with that there's obviously a lot of like things out there that we don't know like how to the our kids you think it's scary I mean everybody out there it's just like a scary thing I know it's not just the US and I know it's not just California the u.s. it's literally way worse it's a global threat so stay safe out there we love you guys and definitely you know we're gonna because you're also you live in any of the places that are being crazy affected right now like China Italy any other big places and a lot of the European countries right now yeah Dynasty em because we'd love to help people especially if you're like diapers or baby formula like anything that you guys can think of that you guys don't have we would love to help you guys yeah it's a hard time so we're here and we're gonna keep posting content as best we can obviously we just felt weird putting videos out there and I'm just like ignoring this so that's that's how we're addressing it but we are just gonna try to live as normal as possible and just you know hopefully make you smile hope you help make you feel just like you're living a normal day but we have a baby appointment coming up so we're gonna find out if you have gestational diabetes and that's a big thing so all Crona by yourself aside well in this film we just so you guys know we're not actually leaving when you guys see this next part we film this part a few days ago before all this craziness started happening yeah yeah so I hope foreign virus is still going on in China but I hadn't like started coming over to other places that much sugar yeah totally fine going to the doctor now we would be I feel like I'd be a little bit more scared to go anywhere near a hospital that's all we got to say we love you guys stay safe and here's adaptive equipment   good morning everybody it's a beautiful day thanks for tuning in to the blog we're on our way to a baby appointment right now a little baby we're going to baby Z's appointment we're excited I haven't seen the baby since the baby was a microchip size because I missed the last doctor's appointment             with you better than one lollipop is to pups bear yeah air balloon she wanted that bear kids all right so we're heading back to the doctors because what Savannah was doing was she she's getting tested for gestational diabetes yeah so it's another today I don't know yes yeah we're excited with Posey today I had gestational diabetes if you don't know what that means we'll probably a little definition of what it is essentially yeah I essentially something that I can't eat bad foods cuz that can be really enough fingers crossed that she doesn't have it because you don't want to add it but it's fairly common so we'll see we'll see so this and then I feel sick disinvited anything since last night yeah I'd like and last night was just a rough night because we did sleep at all she's got a good like a bark like a dog call kind of thing and stuff we brought her a bed with us she never sleeps on my bed but and now she's like pretty okay probably gonna take her in as well cuz I was like I'm really intense coughs huh we don't want her doing it again I could she didn't sleep well we did sick well so rough day so Posey is actually looking the chair so we just caught her she's in the doctor's office looking the chairs yeah so she wasn't already sick she's going around looking all the chairs in make sure that she's really sick like a pineapple it tastes like a pineapple just got pricked if I know she has gestational diabetes we think oh my I'm gonna be positive and say you don't have it this time around oh you know she thinks you - oh my god else ask PO see what you think ice cream and diabetes it's the biggest reason it sucks with one you can't eat a lot - it can be a healthy for the baby and three you have to prick yourself four times a day usually the baby's butt the vein is the biggest fear was hates needles a team you had to prick yourself four times a day I lost my phone so I came back not in the doctor's office in Pendleton we looked on the car it's not in the car not in the doctor's office we've got gas on the way here so I only thought of a bailout let me guess I haven't been on it like at all so I can't even remember when glad it was good leave my phone we found it it was in the car under our huge mess that we always have in our car of course that's where it was whoa I just want my phone call yeah I saw that so it's just prayers are being answered because that was actually very hard yeah like even I know it sounds like so silly to make that a big deal but it really was so I was like on top of like all the Predators trouble okay I'm gonna get wait anyway yeah I'm gonna get it anyway so it's okay to like eat this a few times a week yeah so I just like for me of a said like such a bummer because yeah when I feel like with use like pregnancy is already like such a difficult thing anyways like a ding any extra complications that you just feel are unnecessary or that other people don't have it's like so if you have it again we feel for you especially Savannah yay and the last thing before we end this vlog you guys know that our baby's name starts with a Z baby Z super cool and I posted on Twitter but a lot of you guys guessed some really funny

telling you to do just kind of keep your distance from large crowds yeah we are also board including poor Posey just we're bored so we're never vlogging yes cuz they're trying to figure out thing to do but I had this idea we got a lot of time on our hands just trying to kill time make the most of this obviously anybody out there who's been affected by this we are praying we're you know reach other people that we can help with and there's a large community of people like us who are just families and you know have nowhere to go and just trying to make notes this situation so we follow a lot of YouTube channels this YouTube channel called the North nuts might have heard of open comes I go to them for creativity cuz they are very creative family they live in Australia g'day mate I saw that

of Carl that's something that we would like think about actually I do a lot of looking into I'm gonna say that we can't make it happen but that is like a big thing to buy a house in Hawaii and stay

shake your booty shake your booty just kind of ease man thank you so we're about to take Posey swimming I'm gonna show you guys how awesome Posey is in the water but I'm grabbing her swim diaper in the laundry room that's why we keep her swim diapers and there's a giant horse fly right there the camera doesn't lead to justice but this flies cute it's a big fly and I want to try and get it with my foot blop not by me I don't cook I be a man I might be the man the household guys but I have secured a bunch Oh   got him I protect this house I protect this house no one's gonna sting my family you hear me a little   I posted on my Instagram story a few times got your golf scene but I'm training Posey to swim because we have a pool in our backyard a little hot tub it's to cloning at the pool it's all heated but we can heat this bad boy in 30 minutes we're teasing 8 hours you know cool the little disclaimer um we only heat the hot tubs like 92-93 while we're here we were practicing with Posey for the past few weeks supposed to go to a swim class once a week with me where we have an actual professional trainer and she works with Posey on swimming and I've been there so she I take those skills back home tarah hot tub we work on them almost every single day because I want Posey swimming by the end of the summer summer to show you guys some of her skills I'm pretty proud of it loved the water she loved I'm not sure if we told you guys I feel like we have but every Lea didn't really like swimming like she was kind of scared of it and I think she might have some people I like for yeah she learned how to sew when she was 4 she probably kind of learned when she was like - just because I feel like I've really learnt learned really fast just new things she was just terrified of the water like she wanted nothing to do with it so she would just scream and freak out every time you put her in it she don't learn until shows for Posey loves the water so she's totally opposite I feel like we can have her swimming well maybe even by the end of this video   so as you guys you see a bit we were working on is getting who used to putting her face underwater and not breathing in so blowing yeah so you just do that by teaching them to blow bubbles so she does it for fun but she also doesn't stay chilly or she's walking around the pool with a hot tub or if she has if she falls in she blows out but does it breathe it so then you don't breathe in and panicking a little too much yeah but at least she's not Charles I leave this flavor I'm always right next Posey sometimes I let her walk around the hot tub all by herself just because I was excited screams I think it's good for her to like figure out the back and she ever falls in that she knows to hold her breath and I'm right there to catch it so those are little things that are working out like that - she's dead she's down she's up and no totally back yep totally by little by little you know we started out like initially I was like half a second she was in bra she's in rough well now it's like she could hold her breath for more and more and more and day by day we got more and more so it's just those little things boys you want practice swimming let's record swimming de mama   one two three and put her under ready here we go one two three I know all the way to mama and we're easy asourian very Western rumba lucky mama here we go check the mama white two three yeah yes yes yes she can learn to navigate herself because there's Jetson here for sure on what should happen if you're in public pool so just teach him to be saying yeah yeah okay so we've also been working on holding our breath I don't just do this all at once I go under there with her so I feel her she's squirt me your fantasy but little by little we just do like 1 second then 2 seconds now she's up to like 5 seconds so I think it's all safety just as far she knows like to hold your breath as long as you underwater when you come up you breathe ready Boise let's do it here we go 1 2 3 yeah yeah all right yeah yeah all right yeah yeah but never take a little breath little breather and then we'll try it again and honestly we come in the hot stuff like 30 to 45 minutes at a time I see hot tubs like a warm tub um but we only practice swimming for like five ten those minutes most the time I just order half one of the water South choose plays has fun and knows that you're not supposed to breathe the water in she falls in she's good everybody's always totally good and you can even hear sometimes like right when he pulls her up she's still blowing out so cute fuzzy do you love the wah-wah pony do you love the wah-wah can you say guava   you ready check that guy between one two three ring and rap good always do the one two three so she knows when you're ready just come in until you ready and then or he we've been working on her climbing out she's not too good at this I just think it takes more body shrinking a 14 month old little girl has but with these toys always gonna brighten with the pool toys cookie the toys will get him if you're out here all by yourself won't you do you'll get the toy go get him go get him get a toy you know fine thanks I'm okay I'll just reach you grab it yeah right damn look at those toys thanks remainings you chopped really fast yeah go get a choice okay go get him go go go go go go okay good time like like good girl boozy that one definitely need some more day and it's they they need some assist in all ways to work she's not swimming yet like I said I'm trying to have her swimming by the end of summer but listen fingers crossed last thing is her jumping in on three ready one two but honestly most importantly she just loves the water and I love that and we're trying to just make sure that you say yeah water safety so important we have a game around our whole pool but just in case I don't know you guys you never know what happen you ever know and we're not pros at this but she does take swim class so we gotta protein we know you are boiling   come on let's roll hey what's up welcome back quarantine day seven what day is eight i'm freaking for sure what

she's very good at her schoolwork um and she's been really easy like we're having a lot of fun together doing homework um in school every morning i really like normal school with my own teacher but with my mom i actually kind of like it more now because she's really super nice so we thought that we would end this with like how we actually do things so in the morning we do like workbook pages we do like tests we sometimes just teacher things that you should be learning right now um but next week we're actually gonna be getting like her real schoolwork from school and her teacher is going to be like sending it all to me so i won't have to like come up with stuff like this number one are you ready yeah important i have an important test to do today i get it that's a hard one river the river is cold i'm cheating she's trying to peek look at that she's trying to peek on that thing side side side the side of the fence is green white that table is very white this table's not white at all actually so i don't know what you're talking about you want that all right so i get to do the last four questions you ready and these are gonna be hard are you ready because you know i'm the principal i'm principal's principal hard teacher here we go ready hat   okay you ready banana yep because i saw your eyes dump truck dump truck yep dump truck a dump truck trying to make them hard but still doable you know and the last one is gonna be trampoline you might be able to do this like i like to jump on the trampoline with all my friends on my birthday party after i have a big cake and it tastes so delicious okay so number one so you guys you know some of these are a little bit harder than what she should know but she a great so this one she just only got the n wrong because it's important much of that looks great river is correct feet is correct nice side is correct yeah he's on a roll how'd you get cat right banana is correct no banana right oh that's pretty good wait wait what were you laughing about with banana did you think you got it wrong yeah you did it and i thought it was an e no you did it banana dump is correct but not this this is dump truck it's just a truck

ready because if there's no n it would be trampoline you got seven out of ten correct and that was great for your first homeschool spelling test i'm a little bit more challenging than every first grade teacher at the moment first grade is harder than it looks okay on a real note everly has asked if she could be homeschooled now i think it's just like a little face she's going through right now because she likes it and it's fun right now but i'm still going to send her to school once school opens back up um but i think eventually i would like to home school her because we have a lot of fun

crap that's terrifying Busey seriously love this mask don't wanna find them and scare them with this mask she's gonna love it   you can have it yeah a little but she's actually almost like a little scared Oh who's a yeah girl she can't even see kids yeah all right guys so we're still quarantined I think everybody so quarantined and to be honest the first month of quarantine we didn't do anything active we've just been lazy at the house I'll be working out really good for a while before quarantine and then quarantine happened and I just stopped but this room's kind of aunt Goei that I made because this is the room that I'm gonna turn into my mancave so this is what the room looks like it's pretty empty right now if you guys have any ideas let me know but as you can see at the moment we got some workout equipment so I'm going to put everybody through intense workout - in tents don't worry guys it's gonna be safe but obviously how many pull-ups you can do all by yourself okay do you think you can even do one pull-up she's standing on our stole that's me okay I want you to try and do 5 pull-ups yep in by the end of quarantine I want to see if you can do the number of pull-ups - how old you are so I'm gonna see if you can do seven pools because you're seven years old then I'll give you ten dollars cash money on your marks get set go pull up I'll count that as one even though it's kind of weak okay touch this take - ready set go pull pull pull one two Oh keep on keep on we do three is that fire yeah yeah three yeah 300 400 count it okay you go kick you more the only three way from seven don't touch this okay   Oh without you chest touch the ground nice over down chest to the ground yeah pushovers checks the ground they gave me trust me yeah exactly that's it Dania oh no what you want to show up on video and put your body needs okay so it's underneath also you go straight down and then you just this is rather than you twist like that straight down twist up yeah that's fast fast nice good form Oh Batsy that's like 10 times better already now that we've got some everybody time to mass you have any idea where that rolling thing is sure what you think it is and we'll see if you're right so it's not scooter off-camera I demonstrated yep and then back in and then all we ought to slow as you can see you feel it in your ass slow slow slow there you go I never you get far out y'all one's gonna hold it okay just slow out oh he's good in your apps all right now the fish we're gonna do some more ads okay spring/summer second floor want a six-pack so first things first once you feel the ground like this okay just keep them right it right above the ground just pick up and see how long you can go for         let's get enough Ellis bidding okay I'm sweating it need some water so my hair is getting really long because I can't get it cut so I told Savannah in this vlog I was gonna cut my own hair Jimmy Neutron again I think California just did like another announcement like yes stay home for the whole month of April right yeah whenever we're filming this it's only March 30th means that we literally have a full more month we've already been here for three weeks a month seems like the people working at Target sound like that but definitely ready for this to be contained and over and as I'm sure you guys are you know I've started a little crazy Savannah's I think doing a little more okay than me and she's probably a little more natural the whole body element is there homebody she's a little more what's it what's it long people who and what my parents going to sow it's allergy season you know I get spring allergy season so like sometimes I feel like you know you can get like congestion that stuffy noses sneezes and then you're like oh sheesh like do I have this like last night everybody was like you feeling a little warm and you know it's almost like that we're all like paranoid I do have all the bikes and we got electric bikes check us out the chargin we're gonna go on an electric bike ride soon but my blog back because we got to get outside and explore this it's a beautiful day it's not raining anymore here in California so it's absolutely beautiful but right now it's a kind of sad like my 20 weak point where they literally change everything my last one was like a blood test and they can subtract three things I think good but now it's like well this is like this is usually the last time that you see the baby before the birth that's obviously because of kovat and everything happening and just social distancing which we support it just sucks you know obviously I wish I could go there with her and I wish that we do this together and sad that you gotta go all by yourself I mean with the house then being a passenger seat and whatever I've gone through the chick-fil-a drive-thru cuz I'm already 21 weeks since you're gonna like wear a mask and sanitize everything and just be super conscious and say cuz I've been the one like going to the grocery stores and like I haven't been a little more of just a savanna being pregnant Jesus yeah you just gotta be a professional so be careful I I think I'm gonna make you blog just so I can rewatch it and make sure that you were saying yeah our heart goes out to like we have friends who are literally having babies now the parents aren't allowed in there and like family members like other than like I mean I think the husband's are alone yeah our hearts go out big-time to you guys Hansen all right now your honor right now would be really tough we like having like so many people I can't even imagine so our hearts go out you guys we love y'all a quarantine day fighting all those days   eating some tangerines took a big bite let me see big bite 1q DP by the posies in a really big phase now where she just wants to feed herself good you got tangerine on a spoon bet you never seen that before Oh dip into tangerine and the yogurt and pull it out nothing next-level dude I think if anything else it prevents you from touching your mouth and nose what's your big entry points for the virus I promise you you won't be the only one with one of those on your face you know she is she just got likes to do it herself and she gets messy though   alright I'm here about my hand sanitizer with me at all times we'll see how it goes I'm gonna be super cautious and I'm praying and hoping that everything is healthy with little baby look there's a bunch of signs all over that's a food stand six feet away also I've been touching everything with my elbow because these elevators I feel like are 30s also I'm gonna help everyone else who might touch them very much last time I came in I remember telling you I couldn't feel him at all now I always feel him   ESA knows that Avion   I'll take softer sector seven talk to you guys I'd like it you guys can't hear me got everything checked he's all good everything is all good he was measuring like perfectly average I think I think last time they said that Posey was bigger than she was but she came out really tiny so who knows you know it's kidney it's his leg it's hard all that stuff was checked and everything looks good so that makes me super happy I just got told that I have to do another gestational diabetes test I guess they're doing it twice now which I wanted to kind of do anyway it's just to see if just to be extra cautious if I did have it so I have to do that for my next appointment let's take them another have to drink that drink again I'm super thankful everything looks really good and I can't wait to go home and tell everyone everything is good also a little side note it's actually really sad being here by myself I feel like it's always like Posey and coal or Posey coal and our Billy it's never just like coal by yourself definitely not just me so it feels really weird you're kind of sad but it's okay it's for a good reason and for the next one come on man back in the car about to go home I was super super careful I brought my hand sanitizer and sprayed everything before I'd touched it and after I touched it overall happy that that Cole and the kids couldn't come with me because as I was walking out there was someone getting tested for the virus like right in front of the hospital doors so that was a little scary I mean he was in his car but he pulled up right to the front and my two nurses all covered up went out and tested him I saw them do the nose test so that was a little scary I was really really careful the whole time so I'll be good had the mask on the whole time so I'm good but really happy the babies are healthy in about oh hey guys so I forgot to film an outro for this video so I'm filming the out to a real quick on my phone I

roll alright so currently I am in the messiest room in our entire house lovely rooms our garage garage as I would say but we're trying to turn it into a room but I promised I promised myself when we moved to this house that this wasn't gonna happen to our garage and it did we have a huge garage that we wanted to utilize provide a dance room or like have a workout stuff or like do something with our garage because hey one's garage always just turns into like a giant hoarding thing cause like it's not happening to my garage boom happen into my garage and I mean you can't even walk we just like boxes it just stuff everywhere so today we're cleaning it out right now this is what it's looking like we're gonna film the before and after process cuz this place is gonna be looking sick but look we got like seven strollers a lot of these were sent to us from companies for like brand deal purposes some of them were get me to your mom sounds right like the new baby and then Posey so don't hate on us crab and so many strollers we're figuring all that out but I mean huge cash piles already we're get like a goodwill giveaway pile so stay tuned it's gonna be a nice mug over but currently it's a disaster and you can barely even walk around I mean babe you got this you got this awesome treadmill that you like begged me for saying that you're gonna use it and then it got turned into a show   alright the walkway cleared out so we can walk and it's still bad but look you can like walk now I mean check this out that's looking a lot better a disco ball   check out this pile of trash that's trash this is baby stuff that we need to organize this is goodwill giveaway so that's like the only stuff is like still usable this is just literally all the trash that we had and there are just empty boxes and literal trash okay so we made it all the way to this end this wall that I just has a lot more not a lot more but all random stuff we shoved in the cabinets but guys check this out gonna get the ping-pong table and some of the stuff out of here get it organized some of this stuff is like Savannah's mom's or brothers that we need them to come by and pick up and once they do that we just got some baby stuff golf cart that with the car and we can turn this thing into something awesome so you guys know I'm working on my mancave working on that but we're also going to transform this into something really cool so give us a bunch of ideas cuz it's literally a huge huge room we got someone coming by to take it all away thank goodness so got a whole new garage on yeah anything so much extra space in a room to do back tickety's and we're not even done with it I mean we're still gonna organize this stuff I mean in reality all this is it won't be in here all that won't be in here and we'll probably find set up a place for that all you got your beading here's the car golf cart this guy and the electric bikes and that's it you guys keep you on our youtube videos your name Joe I

across don't touch the floor the floors lava the floors lava oh nice nice and not down down through the chairs yeah this is kind of tough because there's wood and strange places gonna go faster than

was like roughly three minutes and twenty seconds something like three minutes in 20 seconds we'll probably be doing this for the next couple hours guys but American home Ninja Warrior course make one in your house today it's fun see if you can be deadly enemies officially lost it or she officially found it it's actually raining here in California we'll just kept us locked indoors but everybody's like you know what I'm not staying indoors I'm going outside and I pretty sure she brought an umbrella like six months ago and it's the first time she has ever use it so I'm probably the last time she is it what are you doing   okay she's a force I said baby I want you to go out there do that next for me okay we're gonna have a competition where you go out and you gotta do a jazz routine with the Umbrella go and then the real treat y'all gonna watch me 200 huh sorry guys you're really missing oh she's okay everybody it's a moment you have all been waiting for unless if you fast forwarded the vlog then you suck you stink that's what I say right yes okay okay we put a lot of work into our blog so please don't fast-forward and watch it as all great content um okay this is a big moment three names mm-hmm so obviously you guys we aren't gonna tell you the Z name baby Z it's his middle name we do this with Posey and we gave you guys three or four options and I forget what the other options were I know that was it maybe Posey's middle name was arranged for those who don't know and that was the most liked name that you guys voted on so and obviously Susa but but yes if we wanted Posey rain so you liked any of the options that we gave you guys so we were overall just gonna let you guys help us bit with this one we like we're all give you guys three options right yeah and I love all three Savannah doesn't like one of them but we're gonna give you guys three options just to see and here you guys go but without any bias so we're gonna tell me what we're doing towards of what we don't like okay third thing like that okay cuz I'll don't tell them what you don't like okay cuz if you tell them they're not gonna vote for it okay before you like his name well baby Z it's either gonna be baby Z brain baby Z rain like Posey but it's felt differently this version will be spelled are e IG n Posey is RA Y and E so they would just have different versions of the same moment so we all have our middle names yeah that's Rose Richard Everly Rose Posey rain so we thought it would be cute for Mina ever they are told and babe easy to share they both as Posey rain rain that differently it's it's an are another are is Richard Richard I know didn't sound like any special but my middle name my little name's Richard I'm cold Richard my dad middle names Richards my grandpa's middle names ricotta fritters water Richards and deliberate so he wants to keep amateur in it which I'm not saying I don't like the name Richard I just don't think it goes well they don't know all but it first me I don't know the first actually this is an unbiased though and then another okay we're over it and and then the what I hope I don't sound too mean the wild card is cold so which I love babies Ecole do me just because I really has to manhandle my name it goes really good with the first night and I also thought it would be really cool like even though this babies middle name would if it was coal would be cold wouldn't have an are what we were thinking is our next if we have another girl the girls moment could be Savannah and so that next little girl's name wasn't it that way everybody the family can add like it's we're all kind of connected to each other piece of a parent even though Posey doesn't really but does cuz my I was called Rosie Posie growing up like my whole life like anybody who knows me know that's our so those are options okay we got rain Richard and cold so that's all we does sure how we're gonna how we're gonna decide is you guys tweet us answer MD Emma's comment on our instagrams my hold on I got it you guys know hey YouTube turn off for comments we aren't disabling our comments on all of our YouTube videos youtube disable or comments say disabled comments on those family channels of that except for a few specific ones which we have no idea why they are allowed to have comments on not venting just a little frustrated why we we don't have our comments on yeah you just got the old-fashioned way to go tweet us and scream us we're gonna tally them all up I promise you were gonna count all the votes and we're and we're gonna let you guys know what we choose in either the next video like that so don't vote based on our favorites okay III wanna know if I want to know your favorite my favorite it's tough I think rain honestly like kind of I'm like sounds the coolest like cuz that rain is like you right I god reigns over all Posey rains the rain I kind of I gotta think cold those the cutest I I think I think my favorites cold cuz I wanted to think it goes the best if you heard the first name hey but then Richards like a family name so like if we have another boy and we don't do Richard I'm a hundred years old because I just need to keep it even have your name like he actually I'm your name cool cool cool bike hole if you wanted to good if his e names like to out there for maybe there's like cool okay guys well you know what to do hit us up we're gonna tally him up and let you guys know what we're choosing we like you we like having you guys help us it's yeah that's fun it's like having a bunch of friends who we

Easter but we reminded everybody today what today is all about so Evelyn can you tell people watching what Good Friday is all about and why we even call it Good Friday     around 2,000 years ago yep Jesus died on the cross today and why is that a good thing why do we call it Good Friday because it sounds like a bad thing right   that's right who died on cross for our sins so we could go to heaven we're Christian so that's what we believe but what happens on Sunday what's the good news this Jesus was dead today he's dead on Saturday but then what happens on Sunday yep so when you sir Jesus comes alive goes that heaven and we get to spend forever with him if we believe in Jesus so celebrating Good Friday a little bit today but in case you guys didn't know Good Friday was all about that's what we believe in this household but um he's movement babies he gets excited about Jesus can we feel so Savannah can feel the baby but we haven't felt the baby all right so we have the baby yet so we're super excited because the man's been feeling the baby but I wanted to make sure that you got this moment on camera so can I go first he's actually moving right now   that was a big man like his

crazy so we're just trying to think of fun things to do around the house I said that we had a lot of fun doing was trying to make everybody's dream come true y'all seemed up the vlogs we've been trying to think of like what like if we could do anything if we could like have anything meet anybody go anywhere do anything obviously we're kind of limited now Warren seems like if we could get the ball rolling what would it be and we essentially made everybody come true she wanted to meet Charlie D'Amelio and thanks to you guys he helped make that possible um she FaceTime Charlie to millio and she told her son our next time she comes to California she's gonna make it ticked up in Beverly which was super exciting for a super awesome we're super thankful for all that but I want to go ask savanah if she can have any dream come true what would it be and see if she has any kind of answer any kind of response and see if we can help make it happen hey baby I got a question for you on the spot right now uh if you could have any one dream in a whole wide world any dream what would it be no no yeah you know we made every dream come true like meeting Charlie D'Amelio what would you be okay not that cuz you're already pregnant and I'm already making that dream come true anything like we can't go we can't really go anywhere I gonna say anywhere you want to go we can't really go anywhere but I wanted to FaceTime just may be fun you know it gives me something to look forward to be like super serious like favorite person in the whole wide world if you can meet them that you most likely can never really simply meet you oh three two one okay wait you were only gonna do Justin Bieber cuz you think it's good yeah okay I was at one okay so I'm thinking you know you guys got Charlie do millions attention you know we reached out May tick-tocks all this stuff I feel gets a little more awkward cuz you're an adult you can't like make it tick-tock like it's like an ariana

doing that Arianna Paige seaman yeah heard UNIX move out into yeah this is crazy Oh pranks are funny I'm not mad at you for pranking me because it was the most Awkward phone call in my whole life what's an awkward situation I no idea what to say I'm so confused why she was calling me it was all like so quick like why would she say say I didn't believe you I know you say it was awkward so I'm low-key happy that it was the fake Ariana Grande but that's pretty crazy that's insane how much that they look like like I would have never known ever what no no I mean no I mean I guess yeah so

about a little older that's it if you can guess my wife saying oh all right I'm 23 23 oh yeah two years older that's it so this is pretty awesome the manager found out that we were giving money away and so he came up to the window when we were getting our food and gave us $200 worth of chick-fil-a cards for us to give to other people so awesome so we're thinking of like people who I can just like

let's roll good morning guys we just woke up good mythical morning hey Posie look at the blog yeah I can't hide the bug Oh grumbling but it's okay well show you guys our quarantine morning routine we're not like anti TV I know that like a lot of parents like anti TV on their babies and kids we're not anti TV she loves to watch bear in the morning so sometimes we let her watch bear in the morning it's her favorite thing especially cuz we're stuck inside we're doing every up that's what we do we get everybody up get it Gator guess you see   its morning time good but yeah we would make sure that everybody gets up and we also make sure that who did an escape upon the stairs we got gates that we sometimes forget to close so they don't even make any sense she hasn't fallen on the series yet so we're doing a pretty good job whoa did you make this last night sir everyone's telling us that she made a blanket for it which we told her to put away before she fell asleep because sometimes especially like during a quarantine this happens it's actually pretty good for though open that gate lots of gates around here so how's it going under there baby so we usually try to wake up and play so this is very part of our quarantine routine as we try to wake up and just play then we change that baby's peepee diaper because that thing probably weighs like 10 pounds Posey's pee diapers they get packed so ah here's the kids playroom it's kind of like a tornado went off in here recently yeah and a little brother on the way it's just gonna get even worse she's gonna tear apart ratio which is how I do it and she literally just did this when she just drew marker to mark on the chairs so the quarantine warning Dean like it looks like we have been cordoned this week that's good it's just part of having kids well because it doesn't help but never rains in California it's raid war in California the past three weeks and it has the entire year slash more craziness um I made breakfast so I would say that I'm more of like the morning guy I'm bored it's like the morning guy incident is a lot more right to closure like I opened the day a little more with like getting Posey up and ready making breakfast the other way that I have to be such like the morning person okay she still is a morning person like she she's like groggy or anything she just pregnant and I let her sleep in a little bit more but she always makes the dinners she always like cleans up at nighttime or all that kind stuff so account like trade-off but I made breakfast so that's what we ought to do check this out Savannah made these last night chocolate chip banana bread muffins so I'm definitely but gonna snag some of those for breakfast but I'm gonna show y'all what I'm making most breakfast is I'm making waffles crouched every morning we're gonna hang Macon we have the bacon in the microwave eggs bacon we got approach up guys when you're making eggs you're always put it in a bowl and stir it before you even put it on the pan cuz it'll make it cook a lot better I think I'm out of chef that's right spray the pan with pam-pam where the eggs in the pan eggs are always better cheese on top typical breakfast avocado eggs and bacon avocado toes because we had last night at one scene we are obsessed with making banana breads that's like all we've been doing really nice we'll just have our family breakfast we're all happy everything we drink this Perkins elf cozy kind of eats like good animal thank you for your that demonstration of cozy   so I'll see how everybody's muffin is

Tom's toddler toothpaste no promo just showing you guys just baby safe and she loves it I think just think you like to take this with you safe don't watch cute walls at all she's kind of done good hygiene say cheese mr. teensy cheese excuse me for a minute   have you been brushing your teeth during quarantine good every day most days   but so what we do is we get ready for school so mainly all

what's up guys so as you can tell it's getting dark outside we're just chillin on the couch and I've got some exciting news to tell y'all so don't already tell according to the title and thumbnail of the video that Everly is auditioning for a really cool TV show we're not allowed to talk too much about it but because it's a new show it's a new show that they're working on and it's really cool but a lot of kids are being cast for and I've really made it through the first round of auditions and if she got a callback uh which is so everybody has like asked me before she once did you like some acting stuff um my only thing is all the way in LA and we live pretty far familiar like like two hours to get there so it would just be so time-consuming like with school but dance like there's no way that she'd be able to go to school and go to dance and do full-time acting like it's just not well she's never she's ever like a really one to do it it's not like my password is it's just like she's had an interest in it a little bit here and there yeah so when I got this text message from someone regarding what happened did this thing go so um they asked if she wanted to audition so I asked her and she was like oh yes I would right you were like that's so excited so I hate her I'm like okay this is like so ok this is just her first audition like she's like like it's not a big deal I was explaining to her like if you don't get a callback it's not if we feel like it's just fun just have fun with the audition and it was really cute the audition was just super simple and it's like her basically just like telling about herself and just answering random questions and so apparently they had left her they thought that she did really good if she got a callback which is really cool a lot of the kids auditioning for this are a lot older too so yes they're only being 7 he's also the youngest one and this isn't like some like small little like I can't say much about this is like a really cool thing so I if it comes to fruition and then we Han visto you guys a lot more about it but it's really cool nonetheless once the show comes out I'm sure we could tell you guys what it is whether she said or not but she has her second callback tomorrow so we're gonna go through a lot an email of like all the things that we need to have her be prepared for for the audition and it's a lot so a lot of stuff um I really even put some eye makeup on you know it's also nice she's ready for you show them your glam close your eyes so we can't show you oh like a couple of the things because it would give it away but we're gonna show you a good bit of us practicing for the audition tomorrow and then you'll get to see her tomorrow before her audition or her auditions on zoom' because obviously we can't go anywhere but okay you're gonna prepare two stories that you're gonna tell me okay so two stories um I bet you can make the stories true or you can make them a lie you can make them whatever you want and at the end of your story I'm gonna guess if it's true or if it's a lie that's on five okay you know everything but I don't know everything no I'm telling like I don't know I'm pretending like I'm the audition person okay go ahead tell me your first start with the first story that comes here so do you have a story that you'd like to tell me I'm being if you were having a baby and on because last time my dad found out it was a baby and my dad did it but now my mom wants me to see if it's a baby they're so happy so excited I think that's a lie I think that's true am i right yeah you're on time how you can really fool them is tell them a true story but tell them it's a lot they owe me it's my only feedback for that would be you have to make it a little bit longer so give like a few more details be like so my mom was taking the test out so nervous I was so nervous all the time cuz she had a wait for like a few minutes I was just so nervous I just wanna know already and then we sat down and I was still so nervous out there alien to this Organa but you can get details and then you can say that we like sitting on a scanner with post-it notes all around the house man you like you know they hate Martita yeah the little details are gonna be alright so now we're gonna practice you're not true story okay I think it'd be fun if she had like one true story but not to start so you I'm just gonna               she took to run trust me hopping away from losers is never good   okay maybe something yeah I don't wanna know what happens next okay we can stop the story I produce a lie they're dumbbell I've been told a little part of the auditions because she's gonna have me sit down with her and she's gonna ask me ten questions like just whatever she wants and I'm gonna the lady or everybody and ask you ten questions and there's a nice event virgins okay so in the audition you're gonna ask me questions so maybe ask me like two right now that you think you might want to ask me just to practice   what do you for fun well I was who I was thinking I was thinking that we kiss or for fun really truth what you like what do you like you love to cook for your family hmm I really like what I maybe the other night you know that ravioli she said phone so I'm just gonna be like well you know I work on my phone so I have to be on my phone instead of going to work my my phone my phone is all that was the funny one you guys are gonna crush this I can already tell I'm gonna go you guys are gonna crush this every great look great great look   all right so it's morning time and every audition is in less than an hour so let's go see how she's doing the audition is in 40 minutes hey ready III think we already saw you practice all last night I just kinda wonder like how you feeling we can't tell you guys too much stuff but she's really excited about it okay I've only told her tell how I feel right now in case I get the role that's like fun to look back on you know you excited or you nervous as well so she does I mean I can't Vagan Y of it but submit maybe we'll see I might try to be sneaky but we want her to do good so I don't want her warned about anything she's auditioning right now   you're excited yeah you think you did good yeah yeah we were tied you sounded like you didn't really good you kind of Christian you're kind of crushing it I wish that I wish that we could show them war but unfortunately I got to leave it at this   yeah okay well we'll just leave it open-ended like this and I don't have no idea when or if we'll hear back or anything but now I guess you if she gets her if she doesn't get it yeah yep okay say bye come on Nikki you guys okay this one's a little bit cooler than the last one have you have you bought up this whole thing by yourself Wow got a bigger one but I had to duck eat besides became in hold so we just had a big scare thought we're gonna go to the hospital honestly we just got this inflatable pool done while I was blowing it up Posie was hanging out inside of it obviously there's no water at this point she was getting out and fell over the side and she started crying and we didn't think too much of it cuz she just fell over sort of crying but we see your mouth and Savannah's like her mouth is bleeding really bad I'm like what the heck it was a lot of blood he was like opening her eye you know like were say it like posed you say I'll show us your mouth and she's not really showing us we gonna tell her there's a lot of blood in there I'm like rushing to the door and I guess sounds like she's like she's like gurgling on it you know she she's not coughing a lot and like we don't know what happened we just saw that there was a lot of blood she fell hit her mouth took her inside got her binky stuff such as a binky now it goes very comforting for Posie I don't drink some water down examine her mouth and I I was afraid that she'd that something happened to like the back of her throat or something but I think it just the roof of her mouth got cut somehow I see like a little cut up there I think was bleeding pretty bad but she's good now who would have thought that inflating a pool like this would have been successful I'm Absolem I hate when my kids you heard proposed he gets bonked all the time he's like so adventurous maybe she's adventurous and clumsy and is just a bad combo she's good look like perfect and happy and stuff and so many things have an off camera that obviously we are just gonna pick up the camera and blog but not we're about to go to hospital she's good I really wanna do a good prank on Cole and Everly I also want to kind of see how posing to this because it might be funny I bought a big fake stomach and not like too big to where it's not realistic but just a little bit bigger than what I am right now it's like pretty small but I just recently popped I'll show you guys in a second I thought that I can get away with maybe looking a little bit bigger I got this big pregnant belly I'm gonna show it to you guys it's super realistic too I tried it on earlier I'll try it on again for you but it looks really realistic and right now is perfect to do this because I'm me Posey and Cole are just here by myself I really actually just went to my mom's house he slept there last night and so my mom's bringing her back in a little bit so it'd be perfect for us to just be going on with our day and Everly walks in and I just want to see if she even notices because she might not even notice I'm gonna get Cole first right now he's working out so this is a perfect time for me to start the vlog go downstairs maybe put the camera in the kitchen or something we'll see and just see how he reacts I've never worn something tight before either like I usually just wear flowy shirts or big sweatshirts so I feel like it might just be like whoa this is the first time you've worn something tight and you just look so big all of a sudden so we'll see how he reacts but imma show you guys what I look like right now what my book looks like I'm right now I'm 25 weeks so show you from the side but so here's my phone I feel like it just recently got just recently popped so here's the pregnant belly and it like ties around really cool on the back so I feel like you can't even tell that I'm wearing it but it's really realistic so it sticks to me and then the front even has a belly button so it's perfect for what I'm wearing it's just super realistic when I tried it on earlier and it looks really good let's see the difference so see it looks super realistic you can't even tell that I'm wearing it I'm even thinking about maybe oh my gosh oh it's uh I don't remember it looking this big who knows if he's gonna believe this I feel like you might just because I've never worn something tight before but I am pregnant persons you might just look at me and just be like what the heck is in your stress huh it looks really realistic though like if I wore this out everyone would be like wow what are you about to have the baby okay I feel like it looks a little bit more realistic with this on it doesn't I don't know maybe that just makes it look bigger I found a good spot in the kitchen to set it up I feel like he's gonna come in from right here so you guys can see his reaction and I'll stand right here I'm just gonna be making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because that's super realistic for us right now it's lunchtime he is upstairs working out so I'll be able to hear when he starts coming downstairs which should be any second because he's about done I just told him I was making him food so you should be down any second and he falls for this     Oh   oh um Billy thanks Billy to prick your hey good prank I'm not gonna use it okay forget yourself read for a sec like half a second of our I'm with you every single day we sleep together and you know I see this is sick belly which is what I am I'm in my yeah but if you put a six of seven month belly on top of your six to seven month Billy then that's good I think everybody's totally gonna fall for I think specially knife bag not say anything or she won't because she always walks around saying when did you spend it gonna get baked yeah she's been gone for like over 24 hours so I just feel like I ate a lot of food every while you were gone and look at my something he's here it's Everly's Hong yay she's got a million stuffed animals together so what I want to do today you're not that's where he just called you big come to the door and says you got a big belly sad you she's only gone two days another pretty big Annette just so maybe just a dress bigger Oh - enough I told bigger to grow your belly I think is her being gone for a little bit was I at Grandma's house belly hey Bozek you say put it on maybe I should put it on he's pregnant so I'm going to set up a picnic for my parents because we're ordering food it's almost here so I kinda have to hurry set

the house mainly because of Italy the backyard that we're in in space this base the privacy there's a lot of things that went into this house the number one thing that we love about this house is the

grant or mom who needs no stairs I'm reaching out to you because you're home with the guest house is ideal for my client if you were interested in working on a private transaction to sell your home at a nice profit I have another amazing home to show you we listed like all the stuff about it the home is stunning the open floor plans with vaulted beam ceilings yada yada yeah the price point on this home would be similar to what my client would pay you for your turn essentially they are offering us a lot more money that we paid for our house it's weird today is gonna be showing us houses that we

like   it's got a big open kitchen that connects with the living room I like that yeah and then obviously this looks fun yeah I don't you Wow so you just walk right outside and it's like you're uh that's fun and I can already see the basketball court up there too   pretty basketball court hmm it's a hike up to the top of the backyard   yeah but then a little garden up here too and there's a playhouse for girls and then a little tree off of the boy pretty cool but I'm tired to climb up here do I really want to tired coming to the top of this every day Oh golf area I don't I don't golf though super beautiful and out and outdoors grill and hangout area super pretty super pretty outdoors laughing okay so Dalton house number two I mean how summer wine we're going have some acute thoughts and have someone um we like that we thought it was beautiful but we've like we like the layout of our house better are we like the layout of our yard better it's just like you get it's more usable land yeah so so far we still like our house better we like our house better but it was a beautiful beautiful I just find the outsiders off like two rows over style to marshana but we're at house number two so that it looks really pretty on the outside it's like at the very top of a hill like reeling it back right now and okay it's biased but it's fun to do this it's fun to be into our house let's go so you see this mostly house is hidden behind this hill so I don't even really know what most of it looks like yeah       yeah     yeah so this is the upstairs I mean just look it out and see into view that's beautiful it's like you just send a mountain home kitchen and then right outside super pretty pool for the slide   yeah little kids they did this you know twenty kids grew up they don't want to anymore you take it away and you have this park right there that's really cool so this is the master bedroom still upstairs all this is upstairs pretty with master bathroom   what is this secret room whoo it's Narnia downstairs little kids play area superhero can tell we love that house that house is a dream come true besides the art like in the arts really pretty are you still like are we bought our house because of the huge backyard so love yard space we love being able to like just entertain and have so many people over how the kids are running around especially for filming we just need a really big backyard because sometimes we just film it and just you guys know our art house that we live on currently it's an acre of land so it's not like a saying you know like 10 acres or anything it's an acre of land but it's still so open I think it's a little over Arthur and I was like 1.1 or 1.2 this one is 1.5 the whole lot bakers so beautiful home I like it more than the first one but we're going to house number three right now you guys we know y'all's opinion so here we go house number three house number three very beautiful outside very beautiful outside   so this one's on four acres of land Wow a lot of space in California California baby you're gonna love this kitchen see the pretty countertops yeah baby come look at the kitchen     all the privacy in the phone booth room   outside big pool a little big pool guest on four acres I guess is all this what bars   so all that would be our property whoo guess I'll go check that off well playoffs for Posie beautiful gazebo right there so here's the the back house Wow so fun these floors gumball machine brick wall back there this place is so cool it's like a movie theater right here oh man I wish I had this as like a teenager how cool would that be come back in here yeah only problem is I have daughters so I don't want my daughter's back in here with any boys yeah yeah the cameras and all the so cool back in here got the fridge bathroom behind the guest house has in-ground trampoline I can jump on it but then this'll spot Wow   pickle or everybody's wob all over there Wow upstairs cuz I'm this way press on that way probably be the answer   so do you think well that one it's almost like too fancy right there your head goes like we like nice things like it's out of our price range outside of our price range so we can't afford that anyways yeah it's just tough because our house I mean y'all see you house no matter how pretty the backyard house is in California a backyard its yard it's so pretty again it's like beautiful but it's just like we're all about just like the flat land that you can just like run on and have friends over and like play play games games kick soccer ball just like run around and I'm like all these backyards are beautiful but it's just their stuff there's like stuff in every spot so you can't really run around especially with our kids yeah but all right so we all looked at three houses you guys let us know if you like one more than the others or if you think that we just stay in our house looking at our backyard right now and it's tough because we just we got a great backyard that the kids play kind of messy right now cuz the kids are playing it so much so that's a good thing y'all let us know what you think I feel like we both kind of what we want to do I think it we're leaning towards staying but it was still a really cool offer and what I said whatever offers come in like this we never want just like shut it down right away something that we won't like I got always design expected things so we're never opposed to it but we just like maybe it's not the time right now yeah so if you want to do this give it a thumbs up I still find houses but because of all this that's going on and because I've moved into the house this house knowing that we wanted to fix some things up they sir probably just get us started even faster because now we just have so many ideas as what we want to do we want to redo the pool you have so many so what you wanna do because we're gonna be fixing up yeah so if y'all enjoy this give it a thumbs up

you guys saw at the beginning of this vlog we got tested five days ago so yeah this is five days later actually but we got tested five days ago to see if we had the corona virus in the past not if we currently have the corona virus we don't have any symptoms so I'm pretty sure that we aren't currently having the corona virus but we got tested to see if in the past we had it and we just didn't know that we had our results are in so I just got the email and I'm gonna go check in with staff and see if we already had almost like but I'm happy I have a question about that kind of saying it happens gonna be like you know like oh I'm not gonna get it or like I already had it like I wasn't like that affected by everything obviously okay besides results whole brand negative negative negative negative apparently in the medicine community negative means good okay what about other relief fever white dress right now it's just like a tornado right through it and we only have two kids so I grew up in a family of six get some balance if kids I don't want to choose we have to we have we have a third on the way we have almost a half kids I always felt like you know this is a complicated situation and sometimes I get kind of touchy because Savannah its sedated tells me she's like I told you before we got married and I went six kids not like no you didn't tell me that if you told me what is six kids I would have been like hold on girlfriend I told so she holds it over my head she's a guy told you before we've not very Knightly I wanted it but I a guy like let's have a I can't at a time and see how it goes because you have a crazy kid you do have a crazy kid that's like okay we're done you know tomato crazy kid everybody's pretty great together realizing is like I want to be the best that ever and I want to be able to like invest it's what's a man selling are you seeing that dads that have five or six kids aren't that I'm saying that some guys can't I don't think that I'm capable of investing the time that I feel necessary into six different children I think about stress come because I get fried chicken everybody dances imposes her thing is even doing this and then we're just like I could be happy with three kids I feel like I could be content after the z-man cuz we have every the older girl little baby Posey girl and envoy chef I already have girls a boy like would you be content with three yet well I wanted five kids when I met you you knew that you already knew I had a kid you knew I wanted a kid right and then I just wanted to get going I got two kids right away we got postponed Zeman's pop it was perfect I have three kids old that's crazy and I love it I don't you guys thinking like oh poor cool you look strapped to you something this conversation this conversation came out of nowhere but I want the kids that I have all I'm saying is that six I'd really have to be of six kids not as I were six kids I grew about five six five kids I think there's been spaced out they are okay what our kids are doing it is crazy next one will be more spaced out than clothes I just want unseen because they're really cuz they're like eighteen there are 19 that's be fun I am most whenever my wife is happy but I'm happy you're happy that more kids you give me the heavy rope exactly so I was like that so I think I'm gonna build the flow kids but because we're doing great so far we'll see we'll see if three kids rides us but I would say that the only thing that we never do about anyway because we disagree about lifestyle but I would say the bank think that we disagree on or I ever do our view or thinks about as always can't related which I'm sure every parent watch this can relate is like not imagine if you're we love kids I guess kids right in the picture like a bi yeah but then I think then we start arguing kind of the thing that's natural well I think we've addressed this before and like other videos I feel like yeah figured out like we got the same we kind of getting off track yeah but three kids I think okay we do want to foster adults we just watch that movie is family after keep obviously keeps saying it's an if she just like so then

convertible up there it's gonna be so fun where are we gonna go so that's a square we're doing here and we're doing it for tomorrow tomorrow can you guys just that's the square we know it's expensive this is a square though because it has four sides we love home school homeschool's so fun sarcasm good morning sweet girl hi all right we're ready to go bye-bye yeah if you guys haven't seen uh previous vlogs everly i mean posey's room has new wallpaper super cute posey loves it right this feels nice to be leaving the house we're so excited yes um we're still gonna be very safe but we're very excited it's actually my mom's like best friend it's like a family friend of ours and she owns a house in san diego right on the beach since she can't have renters right now we want to help her out we paid her to go stay for a few days it's helping us out because we're gonna have the best time i think that what the rules are at this beach are you can't lay your stuff down so nothing can like be laid down you can't like sit and stay put there but you can like be playing on the beach you can go in the water you can like hang out as long as your stuff isn't like laid out and you're not sitting right there but luckily this house is right on the beach we're basically just going to walk right on to the beach and go go play go honestly if it's not too cold we're just so excited to be anywhere but our house for a little bit still gonna be super safe keep our distance from people obviously um do everything that we would do if we were home     we don't eat sand we made it to our beach house we'll show you guys the house in a second but uh they're pretty strict on the rules cops are driving up and down the beach you can't set up anywhere you have to stay moving you can't play any games you gotta you gotta respect what the what the laws are but at least we're having fun right posie go go   for you   hey     so the people saying above us we're there people staying above us have this new puppy that they're that they've been letting posie play with oh soft sometimes she accidentally waxed it in the face posey what do you think about the doggy what do you think can you give it loves give the dog he loves oh soft socks   yep you want to ride it she's going to get another   cozy say i'll kiss the doggy and then i'm going to get excited be gentle though be soft oh doggy's going away oh posey picked the doggie a flower who's gonna get the flower to the doggy so he go so nice dogs love flowers   maybe he wants to play fetch with the the stem that the flower came on and everyone's over here vlogging on her ipod you'll see here she catches the actually vlog nurse and now she's getting awkward now she's trying to feed the dog rocks and the dog's playing along posey we don't feed the doggy rocks ew oh no don't eat it   she's like does it taste good is it a giant gummy worm posey can you get it off did it help can you say help here we go   okay so we're back from that little getaway vacation uh retreat whatever you want to call it um it was nice even though the beaches were pretty much closed we can't really do anything can't really go anywhere we pretty much just sat out on the balcony it was so nice just to be in a different location and different houses you just like drive yeah obviously just driving in the car like being able to see the beach it was nice and don't worry we didn't see anybody or anything like that it was totally socially distant and the airbnb was totally clean before we got there and so all good there um there was a family staying above us um well they live there so the the unit has three levels on it like the house and the person above us own the top two so they're always there but her daughter was visiting them and she had this puppy that was eight months old that you guys saw that you guys saw and the puppy would just keep coming down to our level because we're on the ground and so she was like are you sure it's okay if he's down there we're like we totally don't care the girls love them it's keep it's keeping them busy and we're having fun with them so that's just where the dog came from just so you guys know um but posey was like all trip like i just vlogged like a little bit of it but that dog is with us like so much and um i think it's like a golden noodle that's like the most it's like popular family dog right now i don't think that one was a golden doodle it was cute it was adorable we didn't even ask because again we weren't really talking to the people above us much just we would almost babysit their dog for them because posey and everything i really love the dog too but posey is just like so obsessed posey's still obsessed with animals yeah so suppose he was just totally obsessed with it so i got me savannah like talking like and you know we don't really talk about car much on vlogs um just so we don't want to feel like we're talking about something just for views or for anything else but he has been missing for pretty much six months now and we did everything that we felt that we could do as far as looking for reaching out on social media reaching out on public facebook pages and this and that throughout our neighborhood and nothing and then the other day we came across like old carl photos of carl with posie and it was so sad like we just feel like she'd love having him around right now i know i know it's tough so like we it just that guy got got the conversation going and everything too but i just feel like posey never really got yeah like she doesn't even know who carl is because yeah she's a baby but it just like got like a little conversation going like obviously we don't want to rush into getting a new dog or anything like that but i didn't get the conversation going of just like when do we feel just with the right time yeah i mean posing in every love like is it too soon to get another dog cause that's mean so just be like oh here's a new dog let's forget about carl or is that like a good thing to do yeah the kids we're you know we don't want to feel like we're just like replacing them in any way but we also want to jump into anything i want to make sure like everything is so safe before we get another dog in this house that like the whole place there's no way nowhere for a puppy to escape you know i just want to make sure everything's really safe honestly we'd probably get a big a bigger dog just for that reason i mean for for a lot of reasons it is but i mean you guys know how small carl was and he could kill the title we see bunny rabbits in our backyard and i'm thinking if those bunnies can get in and out of our game yeah he was smaller than that and carl's smaller than those bunnies so he so there's just like a lot of things that we've been talking about so all in all i think we kind of came to the conclusion that we do eventually what and again this could be a year or two out because we just want to make sure that it feels right or three six months just whenever it feels right we really never know i feel like we like talk about something we could get a dog in like five days or we can not get a dog someone's gonna play that cup saying in one or two years and then it's gonna be the next vlog is yeah we're gonna talk um but but you guys hit us up with like good big favorite dogs yeah and we really want a dog that doesn't shed even that's not like number one but i don't want a dog that sheds all over the house because we obviously we're obviously gonna have the dog being inside dog and yeah the less shedding the better so number one no shed well it can't shed a little bit but it's not shed a lot number two really good with the kids like a dog that's just always good those priorities number one priority good with the kids these are no specific order just what we want um and then what else honestly probably like it's kind of like a good like guard security yeah that's something yeah i'm gonna say security guard dog we we can have sketchy instances with people showing up at our house from time to time and just just safety so if we're gonna get a big dog i feel like any big dog is going to be like they're going to bark and let us know something's happening you know just let us know what kind of dog y'all think because thank you we thought like golden retrievers but then like anybody that we talked to about golden retrievers was like they should they shed so much so they're like is there so i don't know so yeah so we've thought about golden doodles a little bit yeah i don't know if a dude was that scary so now also bring these mountain dogs i heard are really cool yeah so we we're doing our research y'all help us out uh yeah hey bro i bet you won't jump in the pool okay yeah let me just steal it i bet you want to do a cannonball come on do a cannonball cannonball ball three two one go oh oh my goodness what is this thing um on your channel we gotta do a 24 hour

60 70 you haven't seen the baby frightening because he hasn't been allowed in my equipments go wrong a very so I've been the only one that's seen it maybe I don't think Everly besides the first it's

they gave us really cute bear two that had posies heartbeat of it so Everly still had that she was she was just looking at it before we left the house we'll be able to compare hoes cuz we leave it boy they saved all of posies pictures so when we get back to the house we'll compare those these pictures to these pictures I almost anything to see how much they look like and then I'll even see if maybe I have old ones of Everly to this stuff because it's like really acted out like we're close and I would try them us 28 weeks I'm in a third trimester now which is crazy this one by I feel like so fast but I'm just excited to see him and for everyone else see him cuz nobody's seen him in favor let's go   okay so weird we're messed up this place is called better Slurpee we had to we had to bail on our tacos because she said Oh babies we gotta go so this place is called the big reveal and they're open Daron carnivore Sam hello how are you say hi all right great before we get going gotta get

now we got to find evidence do you have ever lose you think don't Joseon I want to compare them don't show us okay guys so the left is posies forty ultrasound or I guess these are HD HD and then the right heart disease and literally the same exact time because look it says 28 weeks zero days 28 weeks one day so they're the same exact same along the theme of posies is if y'all watch our vlog like then you're following us Posie always had our hands in her face that we could never get the best child so showing like all this stuff that you see around her face that's all just like her covering her face don't just remove it that's it like that's right hand up on sofas when we went we even win a second time because it was so hard to get a good picture of her because she always had her hands like this but Z's are like kids are so clear so it's easier to but you get the gist I mean you kind of see the noses lips facial features what y'all think y'all think Z and he looks like he has bigger lips I really have no idea baby shake so much what do you think I have no idea miss too hard for me to tell from any ultrasound only got to still keep that yeah I don't know we have Everly's back okay cuz you ever lose I think everybody's just so so I did everything's at 18 weeks oh this is gonna be a lot like she has no chunk on her whatsoever obviously it's like scary ten weeks are laughy's ten ten weeks earlier and but Noah is nice you know like this is like the HD back then everybody still getting older than her so I might even really show too much of these because yeah it was a scary game again that's one nonetheless Savannah's been kinda sad for the past couple days     come on let's roll I really love does hair every always seekers with a Cyril thing they love each other but that's you you never even let me hug you oh hello little person everyone's got a horse every what are you doing you go get a horse they're gonna buy a horse wait what's going on oh you're gonna ride a horse yo Noah quarantine is not much to do but there's everybody to horseback riding lessons like ten minutes from our house and obviously it's kind of a shutdown for a while but obviously you can like keep your distance we're separating you think really goes right the horses that Posey loves animals as you guys already know so see the horses it poses that time I'll explain its Posey's nap time and we're not doing a nap so we are doing the binky to keep her happy he chose another nap but ever she doesn't nap during a nap time she doesn't she's just weird things like slain with your head into mirrors this kind of stuff   check out these guys what humidor oh my goodness pulls it up big horsey hey that's a big guy excuse you hi man he looks strong hey buddy oh he's that horsey oh this guy Thermidor   it's okay posies nice look look at daddy he's spitting well that's a good horse noise associate the horsey careful it's okay he's a nice horsey ever loves horses but she's a little scared don't let

high-five that's a country girl all right so we're back home and I just want to show off how cute poses outfit is okay Rosie look at dad let me see your eyelashes a few minutes later you're hungry yeah we're check for cold yeah okay guys several of the beaches here in California have opened up entirely so you're allowed to come onto the beach so we got the kids out of the house and we are on the beach we're obviously still social distancing is we encourage you to do we're just enjoying being outside on the beach everybody's napping who's playing but here's my see some people in the background don't worry no one's around us whatsoever so it's freezing here in California but this is kind of fun being   another fan   elihas ha and give a young it's just another boring down this college so we carry this tiny buckets all the way down to the water and bag just to what to say in the try and make a saying console right here we're not gonna get too close to the water because that's what more than people are but Posey really wants to help which we are gonna stop her from doing because pork has been locked up half her life can you do it let's see how it turns out look I'm gonna just one-handed while vlog oh I see you surgeons all better ready okay three two one oh that's good please please please please please oh   if you tear feels too long you just need the TARDIS of take away the hairless house   come on invites you kidnap yeah oh oh I wonder how you do that nap ha you feel good don't you every scar every car seat naps were hysterical okay well that was very fun at the beach and I guess all the kids crash on the car ride home what you think they both needed because we was staying up late and you can tell that there's a little bit of Feist going on at the beach but that's gonna happen with siblings so that's what it is we're working on it yeah but well rested and Savannah's kind of sad for the past couple days a Nia pregnant with hormones who's over here playing with her dog   but you keep me sad that sad cuz look at that yeah yeah soon yeah nine ten weeks and if things are how they are right now which I don't see them changing anytime soon they're not gonna let anybody in the hospital with me that's cool no one likes oh we're going to be in hospital for however long you know we go in once we have the baby they don't let you leave for 24 hours right I mean oh I'm aware they're proposing for two or three days works you there but basically with Everly there was so many people in the room it was just like so much fun and after there were so many people that came to visit like all my high school friends like I just remember it being like so much fun in the hospital you know if you like to look forward to and then with puck with Posey it was meeting you in the room we decided not to have anyone in the room but right after like you know every my whole family your whole family you know with your grandparents like it was so much fun yeah this is gonna be so different it's weird because I and obviously we know it's for our safety reasons like with with Z most likely ever Liam Posey want to be able to come to the hospital to see this you know until we come home laughter who knows how long but I don't want to like keep them from seeing him because I want to like show them to everyone yeah but I don't want them to meet anymore based on whatever saying no like and not that that's bad that it's like other people mean there I like picture so it's like to me it makes me kind of sad like I don't want them to see him for the first time on FaceTime I want them to see the person in person yeah it didn't really get this van it's been getting to me too cuz like as y'all know all my family lives in Florida we're in California it's like we only see my family like a couple times a year anyways and so that's like whenever like the baby was born Posey we got like all my family all my grandparents all my cousins like everybody on one spot which is so rare like besides our wedding like and Posey's birth so we're looking forward to that was II like having her family there is such a big yeah this was a big family member so I mean it's understandable and again we don't want to seem like this that were like complaining because we know that like so many people have been affected so much worse by the car buyer stuff that I we don't want to see my god poor us but it's just the reality of like things that we're facing and things that Savannah's feeling especially being extra emotional during she's pregnant but so many people who haven't we've had friends who've had babies who have been in the exact same situation and our heart goes out to them but you know now we're about to face it so it's just like it's not I know well cuz I remember when we were first quarantined and what mark just echo our babies not to August specially here in California yeah so how do you feel of like knowing we have the baby and you know I would like to see him for the first few days until we bring him home   yeah would you would you want to wait to meet him in person like three days later or do you want to meet him the second that he's born over FaceTime and real life so you'd run away I mean it would for the first time right she would have at least separately wanna meet him in pose he's not gonna have any day what the heck's going on top of these we're gonna we're gonna come home with that baby I'm posing today what is this thing I'm afraid cause he's just gonna be like oh yeah just like lock him in the face she's gonna kiss it

120 million degrees our hotel is right across the street it's connected to the water park that's here so we're really excited about that gonna hit that up in a little bit but we got some other things that we gotta do first   everybody was too scared to go on that giant slide last visit a year ago so yeah that's gonna be fun what do you think posies are gonna be swimming in a little bit we just got all ready and gonna have a fun day look who's here crazy looking twins when did you guys get here i just bought a noise we got in the pool but the first thing that we're going to is whatever was too too afraid and too short to do last time which is the giant mega super awesome big ginormous incredible scary slide water slide that is hey do you think you can do it do the one on the right first and then if you do that one then we'll do the one on the left okay oh my gosh i want to get somebody coming down oh as i can see you come down fast trust me you're going to want to do this 48 inches everybody's there there's no excuses here she can do it yeah we'll see if she actually does it i'm thinking that we'll probably come back down i don't really want to hold the i think i'm going to get more scared we got this i did this last year it's fun but i did warner it is a little scary but i think that you have so much fun doing it i should just want to keep doing it we're not stopping there we're going all the way up now what do you think ab oh no oh here look we're oh my here it's scary here we go you see it wow it's kind of scary if you do if you do want to do it again if you ever go down one of these water slides the number one rule is stay laying back cross your arms cross your legs and everly we totally stressed her that and she tried to sit up because she got scared and it just it just scared her she's good it's okay if you get scared i'm sure she'll go on again later but that's fine okay so we got two pregnant ladies well they can't comment no you can't comment in your head who do you think now that it matters size doesn't matter we don't care okay whose belly's bigger hey we got treats very honest mommies okay someone else i think it's close though hold on hold on turn sideways i gotta get a good view maybe go back to back go back to back hey can i go back to oh well whenever you do that that definitely accentuates it okay who's this bigger it's kind of not the best lighting but uh everybody whose belly's bigger it feels like you're the same she said the same if you all wonder where everybody's lips are pink that's sunscreen on her lips okay so i'm not sure if i uh explain what happened while whenever everyone on the slide you're supposed to have your hands across your chest feet together you go straight down lay back don't sit up because it's a steep slide mid slide everything that she got scared and she tried to sit up and because of that she was going so fast it flipped her under her stomach and she got scared she's perfectly fine but she's trying to decide if she wants to do it again what do you think of i want you you want to you sure yeah are you positive because you don't have to if you don't want to but but it is fun if you do it the right way and it's safe   so kyler madison just asked if everybody could help teach the twins how to swim so this should be interesting wow good job beb hey look it's a vlogging dad oh it's so

be so upset she's even more upset that she didn't go on it okay well she ran down and i told her we don't have to do it we can go back to the lace river we can go back to the wave pool and she said no i want to do it so she's so indecisive so she's going back up with her friend she's gonna try it i don't think she's gonna do it i think she's gonna come back down she comes down like crying and super disappointed in herself we just tell her if you want to do it let's do it if you don't want to you don't have to it's up to you um so she's going back up with a friend cause she really wants to do it

words to say whatsoever but what happened to George Floyd is horrific and our family is just appalled and we stand against any form of racism to the highest regard and we just wanted you guys to know that if you follow us on Instagram you've been seeing some of the petitions that we've been signing that we've been encouraging you guys to sign as well as donations so we'll be sure to link everything down below because we encourage you not to be silent we don't want to take this platform that we have for granted and whether you have a big platform or not be sure to use your voice and fight for justice if you've been following us on YouTube for a while we've got a lot of people asking why we didn't post this past Wednesday because since we started four years ago we've been posting every Wednesday and Saturday but we just fell out of respect for George Floyd and his family as well as so many of the important conversations are being had across our country we didn't want to add any unnecessary noise this Wednesday so we decided to take it off but that's why we're posting this video right now to encourage you guys to sign the petitions use your voice wisely and yes speak up we love you guys we know that now is just such a difficult confusing hard time in our country and and yeah like I said I really do not have the right words to say I'm at a loss for words but we love you guys we're staying with you guys you guys every single one of you are our family whether you're subscribed us or not you're our family and we love you and if you ever need help if you ever need somebody to talk to please reach out to us and yeah we're with you guys we love you we wanted to encourage you to during this time to spread love be kind to one another and that's where our country needs you love you guys okay guys we're transitioning now to our old house so we are forever old house not our current house but the very first house that we technically lived in the first house that we ever bought lived in together that we proposed into and so if you have been watching her vlogs for over a year you know exactly what we're talking about we love this house and we never sold it last year pretty much when we bought our house we've been her house for a year now and we tried selling this house all summer long we tried selling it we just couldn't sell it we're struggling to sell it that's part of the process of selling a home some do you do sometimes you don't so whenever summer is over we put renters in it so then we weren't paying for two houses and we and we had Ritter's in it all the way up till about a month ago we got the renter's out and obviously with coronavirus and the pandemic and so much stuff going on it's just a really hard time with people losing their jobs and just so much going on so it's just a hard time to even sell a house people to buy a house but we're in front of our house right now we're gonna go inside and we're pretty much prepping it to try and resell so check make sure that like the runners didn't do any harm sure they did yeah we're gonna bring you guys along because I know that you guys kind of keep in following us for a while loved this house as we did so it made me go back look a little different and yeah if you're interested in buying the old lebrandt family house hit us up serious buyers only if you live in Southern California but yeah so we never show the front of our homes you know we're living in it because we don't want you guys showing up at our house but we're not living in this home anymore so yeah this is what our house always look like our old house so again if you want it it's for sale serious buyers only here it is southern california is a beautiful we love this house so much and it's in the best neighborhood ever I know it looks good room guys we're in California where this is virtually no front yard okay hopefully the house is destroyed this is legit guys our first time being in here since we moved out I think I think no we're told that someone change the countertops but it looks fine I think this is the same right looks good so pretty much what we're doing now guys that we're showing it off to you is serious buyers only this was our old backyard makes you sad cos reminds you of little Carl isn't it because this is the house of a got a little Karlin and we're home cuz you know Carl was so small and obviously it's just a really small backyard but we'd play with him all the time out here in Finland we had awesome neighbors loved our neighbors fun little girl out area it's a great home we're great home so our previous renters put in this wallpaper in our master bedroom don't really like it so we're gonna change it back not sure someone want to buy it with this one if you do like this no fancy we just I feel like if it's all white and that's just a little better so one thing I loved what this house was it had a second floor but then I had this secret little third floor that was always a lot of fun so if y'all remember this is where everybody would have most of her slumber parties and sleepovers and it's just a really fun little private third floor loft kind of thing with this little birds nest here and I never knew this is for cuz you were just come out here and I always freak me out here so high but you can see the whole neighborhood kinda okay Oh house look

looking for a nice girl who falls on my Instagram so funny eyes okay okay so final transition of the day before this vlog is over as we're going to have our dog talk you guys have been super super helpful with helping us find good breeds of dog Savannah I went through a phase for like two three weeks we all kind of almost got one she was so close if you guys follow her on ice cream y'all saw her putting on Instagram story saying this dog this dog if you guys owned this dog or know any breeders of this dog you really like the what the Bernese Mountain Dog doodle Bernie doodles great dogs awesome dogs and we love it but and obviously also plays their dog awesome breeders from you guys to you guys yeah so we want to just had a ton of people reaching out and it's like too much like explaining some stories whatever all so here we go we don't think now is the best time of your dog we don't want to rush into getting getting a dog let me feel like we're so close I mean how many weeks we'll have the baby like nine ten weeks less than nine yeah so like like we're almost gonna have another baby I think I get we get a dog especially it's a puppy that's crazy right so then we'd have the puppy up all night we'd have to potty train the puppy we'd have the baby we're already in her name right yeah we'd also have Posey in her diapers okay we don't really need over it myself too hard we have Posey who's gonna be too soon and she's already like all over the place everybody's busy with just especially few she goes like school dance starts bad yeah new baby so I here to help with the dog we do want a dog and the kids really want a dog but I feel like we just don't want to rush getting a dog yeah we feel like a good time to get the dog would be like one Posey's two ish and we won't yeah i in and we please don't say you don't have a new one please don't say yeah Posey more but like Posey loves dogs like every like stars do we like dogs but Posey loves I really doesn't really ask us for it yeah so so I feel like I feel like if and when we get a dog it'll kinda bugging it it'll be the family dogs it'll be the family dog feel like it almost like we surprise Posey with it because we got Carl we surprise early with it was pretty much every dog and in this case it'll be the kids dog like I we were really excited up surprising Posey with it because she loves so much as L saw so we want her to be a little older so she realizes it obviously everybody's old went to where she whoa we're not gonna wait on z man sorry Z man he'll be your dog too but so that's that's what that's what we're doing that's just kind of yeah in a nutshell but we are very interested and loved the Bernese doodles so if like you're someone have a breeder who I'm talking to you that's keeping me like in the loop of everything for when she has when her dogs have puppies so that we can know like when they're having the puppies if we're ready for those puppies at that time like wow biggest reason that that that we're looking for that specific dog is because they're so good with kids and like our number one thing is like   yeah she's shedding like I honestly I'm kind of allergic to dogs like like pretty bad allergies like they're they're not huge they're not huge dogs but they're not smiling she's kind of the perfect mix but most important thing is they're super good with kids and opposed he gets cuteness aggression and pulls on a sea air here and there we don't want we're doing so unfortunately yeah we thought we were ready for a dog we really were we were so close together yeah we were bordering chrome corn yeah like all of you guys I think our family kind of like group so we might we might foster a dog in the next couple months you know thing we might foster into some dogs so I've been looking for that but we aren't gonna get a dog so family kind of made us come back to yeah we so thank you family members for reminding us what scene in life we're entering in okay

right so I just pulled up to my doctor's appointment this is a big one this is my 30 week I'm a little late it's gonna be like my 32 week really but I'm gonna have this baby so soon I feel like this pregnancy went by so fast quarantine and everything I thought I was gonna go by so slow just because I feel like life was moving so slow but I just I I feel like everything went a lot faster than I thought it was going to be so my due date is August I think it's August night August 9th August 10th I need to ask today because I don't ever know I'm kind of sad to go into this appointment because I feel like it's such a big one in cold nobody is here with me because they can't okay because you still can't have anyone come with you to your doctor's appointments over I mean like that I got my master side going into a dark room by yourself like he's bit he was at every single one of posies so it's just sad to think like he's barely I mean he's only been to the 3d ultrasound and then I think the first and second appointment for babies he and he hasn't been to any of them since because he can't so it's so sad it's all right I'm gonna go in I'll talk you guys through anything that's exciting because this is a big appointment so let you guys know what happens   so big in there   all right so I just have my ultrasound and they are actually saying that the baby is measuring a little bit big which is crazy cuz Posey was so tiny but also if we have a bigger boy right that'll make Cole happy she was just like you're so tiny but the baby is measuring so big and so the doctors wanting to induce a week early um I went in to get induced with Posey a week early but I was already in labor when we got there I'm going in a week early for bbz so that will put my the date that I'm gonna have him let me think August 3rd I think so now he's gonna be here even earlier which is crazy I'm about to sign this consent of being induced so here we go so my doctors in here and he's saying that the baby is a big baby what do you think I didn't know I can make such big babies cuz you don't miss somebody give him that big he he says he's just hiding them again in my stomach but we're net so we're being induced not because he's big but just because I like being abused right so 39 weeks what is that what is that what day sir we do the second ok so while I just come in at like 7:00 a.m. or how's that work probably your services versus new production or problem okay all right well that there you have it due date August 3rd look who's here with me now I just picked up my girl well I've locked my baby appointment today because I have something crazy it's kind of kind of already told you I'm having the baby a week early she's confused she's like what why he's a big boy the doctor said I was because I never I never know if I believe it because they told me everything was gonna be like nine and a half ten pounds she came out seven eleven and then they said Posey was gonna be big like eight and a half and she came out exactly I think she's like six eleven or seven pounds so who knows you know like not saying that the the nurses and the doctors are wrong they're awesome sometimes the measurements can be a little bit off so well we'll have to wait and see if me and Cole can pull off like a big boy that's gonna be awesome your dad doesn't even know so we have to get to tell him that we're having the baby early when we get home he doesn't know he doesn't know so yeah hello okay you wanna tell me something how the babies sound go get one good she got back so yeah also they told me here's some good news yeah but is some good news good news is you can come to my next testers appointment oh I thought this is last one when doesn't go in the next one don't weakness but there's not an ultrasound at that one so it's kind of boring so I probably I'll show if I get haven't been to a baby but from now on I'll be home soon so you're they're saying Oh so here's here's some bad news they're still saying obviously no one else in the hospital right now as it now just might back a change and then here's some crazy news I go to like lay down and she's I talking about how tiny I am and then all of a sudden she's like well your baby's in the 90th percentile she's like really big go see but then she's like but working I'm confused how he fits in here so he's literally like social finished up with my stomach right now so sad we're guys his head she said his pet is in the 90th percentile big and the richest part before I rested his body than 78 Wow so he's like he's measuring like two weeks for me he's measuring at 34 weeks and I'm 32 weeks math big boy she's nothing he could just be long you know and that's like what I supposed to be long and skinny come on skinny because I don't have any but I'm like kind of really nervous she said that he probably won't be more like eight packs Posey was such a little baby she's stupid speaking eight pounds I have measurements right now it's like four pounds four ounces and that crazy yeah and obviously we don't care about like as I'm gonna have a healthy baby we don't care about that but like I think as a woman pushing out a bigger baby that's a more scary than pushing out a smaller babies yeah yeah whenever you do a natural birth and all that so positive so it was supposed to be like eight half pounds and she met six eleven they told me Everly was gonna be nine and a half pounds and she came out 7-elevens but again we no no no dissing dunkers that's our experience with excitedly they tell us it aside sing uh let's guess we'll see if yeah because a lot people they're like spot-on yeah okay okay I guess he's coming soon I know I wonder what it is with me why why all the babies met her big in older sons I'm gonna be interested to see if he's like actually bigger no no we'll see but so anyways that was my last thing yes he's gonna induce me on August 3rd   that's earlier instead of the 10th oh that's a week earlier we have like a week like the week countdown every everywhere maybe seven weeks instead of eight weeks oh man summer now and it's just gonna be June is gonna be over July having me over things here yeah I'm kind of stressing out what if it comes in like six weeks you can we were so good we were so prepared for Posey because I am with him we're just not prepared yeah it might be like third baby syndrome but okay well that's exciting I love you I love you I wish I could be there with you it's kind of fun to have like and if he doesn't come before then and we're going in on the third no later Wow okay well you heard it here I guess you've already already here huh doesn't you don't you guys I'm kind of all for this because one that's full-term 39-week sizzles terms of debate is gonna be super healthy I had Everly ten days early and Posey came a week early so I know that and I am like all for epidurals props to anybody who can push a baby out without the epidural I think you guys are superheroes and I wish I could do that but I will not that's exciting but that's all yeah it's really sad when doctors   I'm not excited to stay in here we need to go to bring cozy in whenever everything would want to come with us bring get really any pause I don't like I don't like it's sad like I don't feel like it's like as exciting as it was a cozy I bet like a lot of

that one oh yeah it's a little baby don't eat them she keeps trying to eat them   what are you doing i'm just vlogging what what are you gonna prank me or something no   um   we wanted to update you guys on posies swimming journey you know so much more about this i don't know so posey started i s i always want to say irs isr swimming lessons basically it's like swim safety but she's learning how to swim but she's also learning how to swim to where she could save her life if she were to jump into the pool i'm not like an expert on it but what they basically teacher is if she jumped or fell in whatever okay she would be able to um float on her back and then start swimming and then float on her back until she could reach the edge of the pool or the steps whatever she however she could get out so it's basically teaching her to hold her breath when she can't hold her breath anymore she turns up and she floats and then she goes back to swimming until she can reach the edge especially because we have a pool we're really good about like always keeping our gate closed we put a gate up as soon as she started crawling basically we want our kids to swim early everybody didn't learn how to swim until what like four and a half yeah i really didn't learn how to swim until she was four and a half so we want posie to swim earlier which four and a half is fine but i think since we have a pool yeah we just need to be better about yeah there's always tragedies that could happen and obviously we just want to be on top of on preventing it and honestly we were kind of against it for a little while i i was kind of against it because one as a dad i wanted to be the one who taught her how to swim i taught everybody he was nervous about it like scaring her too because obviously in the beginning of her swimming lessons it said yeah she was crying and it was hard it was hard to walk to really it really is if you guys know anything about isr lessons they're hard to watch at first but she's loved it today so we're gonna show you guys because today was about day five yeah i mean only day five we're gonna be doing it for a month or two and so by the end of the summer she will be swimming which is super awesome just because by day five she's already improved so much which is incredible crazy so we're gonna put in the video that you got on your phone so you guys check it out i have a few clips we'll like show you guys like day one and then up to day five which was today and she's so good today we're so proud of her if you guys follow today on instagram uh if you don't follow her but if you do then you've been seeing these on our instagram stories but we're gonna put them in here in case a vlog people haven't seen him yet so you can see the progress day one through day five we'll keep you guys updated because that's honestly super cool and we're super proud of her any of you parents have been like thinking maybe you guys want to do it um you really should it's hard at first to watch like it's very it's just sad you're seeing your little baby struggling in the water but i just don't know what's going on so like to them they're just like why the heck am i doing this but today i feel like it was like a realization of her like oh this is fun like everyone's copying for me and the guy who's teaching posie like he he's so amazing he's so legit like he's renowned mike michael yeah i thought he just said his full name so if you guys know michael um but he's like literally renowned across the u.s for being like one of the best women coaches ever and the today show is actually at the place yeah where we're filming today we asked for posey not to be filmed or anything but um that's just like how well known and renowned he is that he's he's so good so there's experts like i get all over the u.s so we encourage you guys okay we're gonna put the videos   bye     okay guys so here's our pool savannah has a vision tell them honey well i'm eating we are

whole process so we'll be showing the design that we're going to do this is something that savanna's been wanting to do since we moved into the house i want to make this like a cute little garden area with like really pretty flowers and just make this like beautiful flowers okay there will be like the lounge area you know like some some chairs that's a barbecue we got like a whole side backyard mid summer we kind of want to get design ready so that whenever summer's over we can just like get right into it because it's kind of a long process to do any kind of backyard renovations so we're starting today all over for like the best outdoor design people these guys are the best like they're so good you guys have to check out their work we'll link them below for you guys so you guys can

letting savannah take over the reigns because as you all know she loves designing and all this kind of stuff so this is gonna be so fun first she's been wanting to do like i said since we moved into this house and i've been kind of pushing the brakes a little bit just saying like slow down now green light go so she's excited about that but um i'm gonna briefly show you guys what our backyard looks like right now so you all know here's the pool like we talked about we've had this gate around it for the longest time so it's a great pool but it is like 20 something years old um so this part it's so sharp like they said that essentially just needs to be polished but like every time that we go in the ground because it's so old it's not polished and it's honestly super sharp especially on kids and posies all around the pool we got tile falling off it's happening all over the pool little things like this y'all just aren't gonna be able to see like in normal vlogs but because they're showing off now there's a lot of this kind of stuff is happening like all over so we're literally gonna redo the entire backyard like it's gonna look like it's gonna look like a whole new backyard what so here it is out here just big ol cracks like that all throughout it which just makes it unsafe and not look good so we've been using this giant flower pot area for turtles home um we actually have like a nice tortoise house you guys haven't seen that vlog here he is serious we talked today and we want to surprise everly with getting turtle a friend because we feel bad that he's kind of lonely in there so friendly and cute too yeah actually he's not really gonna run away on us stay tuned for future vlogs we are gonna get turtle a mrs turtle and maybe a bunch of baby turtles would happen that'd be sick i like turtles all right so here's jesse want to tell them a little bit of what you're thinking yeah ready ready okay so what i think we should do is like open up both sides like bifold doors that open all the way out or sliders because it's so big yeah this will just feel like one big giant brew so bigger pool and then like water feature in the back i know you guys want like a slide so then there's like usually a waterfall coming from the pool into that fire pit it becomes like this this feature that accentuates the vibe in the house even if you're not outside yeah that's pretty cool what's going to happen in that backyard robin are you excited yeah so excited it's gonna be fun um all go check out his instagram we'll show you guys his instagram right here also link it

whatsoever but Devan is obviously nearing the end of this pregnancy and she's starting to swell and a lot of that swelling is happening I know we've been doing a lot of big rapacious for this kind of

weird babies we are pregnant with boys and girls and they move next door and now we are the same anyway we were thinking since we have the same doctor and our doctors down to it juice us both the doc did the doctor to bring this idea do some the same day and we like have a race like you can get the baby out faster who's gonna have it and then need to submit a challenge okay Abed it's like obviously here we got you for serious thing but it's buddy like our doctor thinks that's really cool so we were thinking it might be fun to get do something same day but we'd like to want to know other people's opinion like is that weird if our babies have the same birthday or is it a where there's like to get you something anyway yes we don't know weird or felt like we got a child's birth is like a super important serious thing but this is your last baby but supposedly last baby and be so fun as best friends to do that like super seriously I can just be fun now like babies yeah with your best friend did like make it silly we can make your birthday we don't have to make my child's birthday silly like we're like a mask you're silly hi our child's birth videos are like really silly like

lot of time with each other but we've had a lot of time each other absolutely go to be each I really don't know I don't know cookers III feel like how our relationship works Dawn was like okay babe

like the Jojo slime company and other slime stuff but yeah exactly I mean slime is not a new thing by any means but we feel like it everybody could have a pretty successful slime company especially cuz it's something that she's like super passionate about so maybe I if you know some people who are in the toy or a kid production industry we can get some calls going and maybe get some balls rolling soon you still around to be perfectly honest but anyways alright guys what is log pretty much over but I just want to share something with you guys it's late and kids are asleep and Savannah so gone she left Thursday right after lunch and we've gotten busted a Thursday all day Friday it's Friday night right now you go to be seen this tomorrow on Saturday and then she'll come back on Sunday but just not having her here has just made me realize how much I miss her and I'm sound cheesy but she really is just the glue to our family and you guys don't see how incredible a mom that Savannah is just off the camera she dedicates her entire life just to being the best mom and the best wife and the best friend in the entire world so I just want to shout out my wife who's not here because I miss her so much and I don't know how I would do life without you so I am so excited for Sunday for you to come back because I'm lonely right now this is Yuji where you be with your little spot and your giant pregnant pillow thing but I'm doing some that I honestly haven't done and wait too long that I need to start doing more recently I bought myself and Savannah new Bibles so we obviously had old Bibles that we would read together but I bought us these new Bibles to have our names on them and just more so or like in encouragement and motivation didn't get us more into the word I feel like our country and just everything is in almost a state of turmoil just with everything that's been going on between the virus and racism and all the hatred and all that so um you know being a family who believes in Jesus being a family who obviously doesn't have it all together we are not a perfect family whatsoever we have our daily struggles all the time but being a family who just believes in Jesus and believes in the faith and the hope that he can bring that that's only gonna come from us reading his word and praying and getting closer and more in relationship with him so I want to show something with you guys this is one of my favorite verses of all time it says it's Matthew in case you were wondering at Matthew 11 verse 28 it says come to me all of you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest this is Jesus talking take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light and I honestly read this verse to myself almost every single day every single morning just come to me all you who are weary and burdened come to me all you who are just tired and I find myself just tired a lot throughout the day just so you know if I get on social media and I look at the state of our country and I just I have so many friends who are hurting so many brothers and sisters in Christ and just they're hurting and they want justice and come to Jesus and he'll give you that peace he says my my yoke right here let's see he says take my yoke upon you and learn from me and I love down here I got the Bible that kind of explains what things mean and it says we can get into focus a yoke was a heavy wooden harness that would be put on an oxidant attached to equipment and the oxen would pull it so essentially people back then would know exactly what a yoke was there was a thing that you were attached to an ox it had a big old cart full of stuff and I'm Jesus is just saying take my yoke upon you so take off the burden of your yoke you're pulling so much baggage you're pulling so much unnecessary take my yoke upon you he says for my yoke is easy and my burden is light this is my favorite part and you will find rest for your souls I think oftentimes we find rest and so many different things I know myself included we try to find rest and just sitting down and watching a movie we try to find rest from even just sleeping and I'm not even saying that these things are bad I do them and oftentimes I can overdo it to where if I'm exhausted I just wanted to play some video games I can overview that but I'm not getting to rest for my soul and I can go and play games where I can go and get away as long as I want but I come back and I'm still almost even more exhausted than I was when I left so Jesus is saying find rest for your souls in me and I've and I found that to be true so I want to encourage you guys that if you just feel exhausted and tired and overwhelmed look to Jesus now that's what we're doing in times like this and again like I said we are imperfect but that's why we're looking to the one who we believe is perfect and that's as Jesus so who loved you guys thanks for watching our videos yeah we will catch y'all okay you ready one no come closer one one two three     come on let's roll hey guys so the vlog is actually over I know that he just started watching it but stay tuned because you're about to watch an entire blog but at the end of the last vlog I shared a Bible verse and I want to start doing that and I shared at the end of the video but this one I want to start it off at the beginning of the video so we're actually getting ready to go to bed and we're doing our Bible reading and I just wanted to share it with you guys before the vlog even got started so like I showed you guys Savannah and I got some matching Bibles and recently we've been trying to read more so I just wanted to share a quick little verse out of Matthew 14 verse 25 is where we're gonna be picking it up so this is a story of Peter walking on water which is actually something that I got tattooed on me the verse itself shortly before it on Jesus went out to them walking on the lake when the disciples saw him walking on the lake they were terrified it's a ghost they said and cried out in fear but Jesus immediately said to them take courage it is I do not be afraid Lord if it's you Peter said tell me to come out to you on the water come he said then Peter got down out of the boat walked on the water and came to Jesus but when he saw the wind he was afraid but and he began sinking crying out lord save me immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him you have little faith he said why did you doubt and when they climbed out of the boat the wind died down then those who were in the boat worshiped him saying truly you are the son of God Jesus is always calling us out of our comfort zones he's always calling us out of the boat where we feel safe and on to the water and while we're focusing on Jesus even though the winds are howling and the waves are crashing and all that stuff as long as Peter was looking at Jesus and his eyes were locked on Jesus he wasn't afraid and he was able to walk on the water but it was whenever he was looking at the waves and looking at the wind and he became afraid for us that's looking at the world looking at anything that can give us anxiety looking at all the stress we start to sink and we cry out to Jesus and whenever we cry all the Jesus he always reaches out and he it's us but he reminds us why why did you take your eyes off me you're gonna sink it's gonna you're gonna sink every time so yeah I just want to share that way you guys keep your eyes on Jesus stop focusing on all the stuff that's just trying to scare you and distract you and you're a lot less likely to sink right there right okay to the block so guys welcome back to the vlog some company sent us a bunch of dad hats and I thought come on that point in my life where I just don't even do my hair I just wake up and throw the dad hat on and get ready but my beautiful wife's at least she's back yeah I walk Savannah left your best friend's bachelorette for three or four days yeah we got some news you're about to call your doctor oh yeah so this is like kind of like a don't talk right here so if you're at the kid you want a fast board then go for it - am i lose your mucus plug and usually what that means is like the baby could come within days or it can come within like one two weeks if you like look it up I just looked up and said I can come soon or can come one day two weeks after you lose your mucus plug I'm awesome but I know that's exactly what it sounds like it's an acid Oh mucus something in there that comes out of here and it means I think it I think what it means is like that your cervix is starting to open up which makes sense so I have never seen that before like with either of the girls I don't ever remember like losing it or seeing it and I like noticeably saw it today it sounds like oh my gosh like I'm only 34 weeks right now so we still have a good bit like we have five weeks until my induced day six weeks until I'm would be due but like this is really early for something like that to happen so I was gonna call my doctor and just ask because I've never before we think that the girls I don't know um it doesn't call my doctor and I was gonna have you guys which means that me which means that if this is true baby could be coming any day in the next few days or two weeks but wherever you look up losing your mucus plug that's what it says and she definitely lost her mucus plug so well I'm gonna call the doctor we aren't doctors so this was like our train of thought as this is happening yeah hi this is Sabina and lebrandt um I had a question for either the nurse of the doctor they were able to jump on just a super quick call I am pretty sure that I just lost my mucus plug but I've never I've had two babies before so I've never had seen this before I'm just not sure if that means anything I'm like super early though I'm still 34 weeks so I didn't know if I needed to ask them or okay okay we don't have like the baby's room done yet no like all that or I'm doing like in July and like we don't have because of course we couldn't yeah we don't have like the baby stuff and like so much stuff that we had I prepared already with Posey just quarantine we've been a lot more setback and stuff so if he comes like now I'm alright alright we didn't do our babies Amazon through diapers but that's right divers the other breast milk will be good but oh yeah um I mean I'm always having Braxton Hicks like I feel like I just have them all day long off and on but I'm not leaking okay so just call if I start having the directions or John linka okay all right thank you unless certainly your kotaki then you're a manic how to do this vlog miss the water brings ask     so got a different dad hat on and we are at posies swim class if you guys haven't followed along y'all know that Posie is doing is our is our son is our swim lessons behind watch los blogs it just kind of teaches babies that if they were following a pool or something to be able to float themselves and swim themselves to a niche so we think it's all right well Posie did an amazing job swimming was so proud of you I mean she's only been going for what like three weeks maybe Mike two weeks how long now on but because every is like Gigi's right now her grandma's we're about to pick her up before we picked her up we wanted to surprise her as you guys know we've been looking at different kinds of dogs and stuff maybe because we're bored during quarantine we don't want to rush in anything anything like that and you guys have heard us talking we want to get our turtle a friend so we're gonna go to the pet store we forgot our masks Savannah's gonna decide to grab the mask quick but like I was saying we do want to get our turtle of turtle friends so we're gonna surprise everybody she's been begging us that's what we're here to do and maybe see what I'll say yeah or we could surprise and early with a parakeet host what do you think well I called this place 30 minutes ago and they had a tortoise and it sold out one there one tortoise someone came by and got it I know we're sad and we called literally every Petsmart every Petco within 30 minutes of us and every single one they like ten of them all sold out of tortoises mr. president we're gonna pick her up had us all planned out gonna be now all right well it was the next day because as you guys saw yesterday the girl who got all ready today cutie cuties and we can't tell every surprise but we had to tell her that we're leaving in a second because sisters in town so she's gonna be staying over the sister so he can't be like where are you going how come I can't come so she knows that there's a surprise so we're gonna go pick up the surprise and be back in a second but   that's a big that's actually a really good one to my good friend Larry Oh okay so what rides with jiminy crickets day my good friend Larry just woke up from her nap and look at those those snuggles ever do you love your sister yeah Posie kiti's to see you I succeed all right suppose that this place has it we got him and when you learned a lot of information you can't put two male tours as the other and you can't have two different species of tortoises so they have I said whatever species in there but we aren't sure it's a male or female they didn't know that code in know so we had like look it up the snake what ours is and hook and we're just crossing our fingers that this one's a different gender than the one at our house and then they can live together because if not we got to keep them separated because they can kill each other didn't know that tortoises were so fine up brutal this one's a little baby nonetheless every gonna be super excited for now we got some other tortoise stuff food home yeah should be fun surprise let's see him so so cool about this one is he's actually a baby ergo cutie is he's so little so we had to check out our turtle because if the turtle that we currently have is a boy then unfortunately unless if this one is a girl they won't be able to live together boys and boys can't live together because they can fight so as long as one of them is a girl obviously we got our main guy over there and we'll keep this one in here for now just until we find out so nobody gets hurt alright now it's time to surprise up okay you ready one one one two three   yeah we got a new turtle but this one's a baby so that way our turtle can have a little friend oh yeah I mean there's side you show people so here's our other turtle and we love him he's just because if it's a girl then we're in the clear we look stuff up oh it's a girl for sure yeah I'm pretty positive um its tail it's how you tell guys see how it slanted though it doesn't like how the girl one that you showed me I'm hoping it we're hoping it's a girl cuz if it's a girl then as long as that's a girl they were good I can get girl and a boy and they're fine yeah that just can't be a boy oh look it is a guy and until we find out for sure what this one is we don't want them to interact so kind of keeping the men distance don't get too close over your buddy he's like hey what's this guy doing who's new guy oh all right time to move yeah why can he not well because we had to find out if it's a girl if it's a boy and they'll fight really if this one's a boy maybe but we don't know what this one is until it gets big what do you think keep you gentle gentle so I oppose you yeah be soft okay don't be soft so he looks a lot of stuff up and we definitely have no idea I'm pretty sure that we had this is a female this is definitely a female that's what a female one is and then a male's is like a good bit longer like its long and it slanted out like that yeah ours has a short tail you get foot butter side down it's a short a offshore and it's like kind of slanted out like the female ones pretty sure we have a female I'm positive you know we could do is we could send a picture to our to the guy that we got that hit guys I'm sure she would just be nice and tell us guys okay so Everly we don't know if it's a boy or girl but I think that I think that you can name this one yep whatever you want whatever yep last time we without the turtle we get three ideas of what you guys vote but this time I think because we're surprising ed with it she is a decide okay it's not too much thought every came up with her name Tom         we'll keep you guys updated right now we're separated until we find out the genders and we want to be certain about that we don't want any Terrell getting hurt tortoise scanner so you guys be sure to do thumbs up subscribe in front

sprinkle because it's all of our first boys so yeah there we fun but before we get the vlog started I wanted to share with you guys another Bible verse like we've been doing in the past couple vlogs I kind of want to keep it's a tradition and you guys seem to enjoy it and just kind of share with you guys what I've been reading and so today we're gonna be reading something out of Mark I'm kind of a saying in the New Testament what are we gonna be doing from mark 15 starting at verse 6 and for a little bit of knowledge not what's going on here essentially Jesus had already lived his perfect life on earth he came from heaven to earth he loved the perfect sinless life he came and He healed people performed miracles loved people brought hope and people hated him for freaking truth and they had him arrested so this is right whenever Jesus was arrested now it was a custom at the festival to release a prisoner from whom the people requested a man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrections who had committed murder and the uprising so it's Jesus who had no wrong as well as a man named Barabbas who's a murderer the crowd came up and asked Pilate for them to do what he usually did do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews asked Pilate knowing it was out of self-interest that the chief priests had handed over Jesus to him but the chief priests stirred the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead what shall I do then would the one you call the King of the Jews Pilate asome crucify him they called out why what crime has he committed a spy but he shouted although outer crucify him wanting to satisfy the crowd Pilate released Barabbas to them he had Jesus flogged and handed over to him to be crucified it doesn't seem like much and a lot of people ignore that and I'm kind of coming at this from a perspective of what my favorite pastors named Judah Smith did a sermon Jame about this I'm gonna link it down below it's only eight minutes I really encourage you guys to watch it after this vlog but it really points out the fact that back then they would have two people who were guilty of some kind of crime and they would release one of them back to the people whoever the people wanted so they had Jesus who had done no wrong whatsoever and Barabbas who was a murderer and they called out give us back Barabbas and killed Jesus and you look at us you're like what that's insane but knowing now Jesus loved BRABUS and like Judah Smith explained in his sermon Jam we are Barabbas but all the times the Bible we use like the most extreme examples and cases so obviously we're not all murderers but in this case Barabbas was an actual murderer but Jesus loved Barabbas and Jesus knew that he had to die on the cross for people like Barabbas and me and you so that we could spend eternity in heaven within Jesus so it's just a beautiful example of love and compassion and how much Jesus loves us and loves Barabbas that Jesus didn't say work he let Barabbas go he gave the people what they wanted and he let Barabbas go because he loved Barabbas he loves us that much so that's all for today and I hope you guys enjoy the book so

of needed a haircut anyways corn     come on let's roll hey guys I said before this vlog is started I want to open it up with a little bit of God's work real quick I've been doing this in the previous vlogs if you've been watching and this one's gonna be a little shorter than some of my previous Bible readings and honestly if you're not a Christian and you think that the Bible is just bogus then I don't expect you to listen to a single word that's coming out of my mouth you keep asked for this if you want as a Christian we believe that God's Word is necessary so I'm reading it to myself and other believers and I encourage you to listen as well and maybe you're on the fence to where you don't know II bleak today I'm gonna be reading from proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 is what we're starting into some of you verse 5 at 6:00 and this says trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways submit to him and he will make your paths straight I mean it's always important but especially with so much going on and I think I've been stressing this in our past Bible readings but just there's so much going on we tried to lean on our own understanding we're gonna fail every time we try to rationalize if we try to understand our human brain what's going on but it says lean not on your own understanding but on God's because if God is real and God is truly in control even though it seems like chaos God knows what he's doing in God's in control and God can work all things even things that the enemy deeds for evil God works all things even those things for good when we believe in him I just want to encourage you guys this week and all that you do submit it to the Lord and everything you do to glorify God and watch him bless it this week all right dread for you baby girl oh she's like like a dog chasing a sale so guys so guys so guys she actually liked swimming now she's loving it's really I'm really hoping that she likes in the vlog cuz I swear the past like three days all week she's been liking it so we'll see     so everybody has horse camp all week which is awesome she loves that cozinha just continued every week pretty much all summer she's doing her some lessons and it's eight alright she's late those oh yeah fingers crossed he's definitely getting a lot better and enjoying it now so we're hoping that maybe the second half as I got really well she's the reason why they don't enjoy in the beginning is because it's just so new like they're flipping onto their backs and of course water is getting in their mouth a little bit so they freak you know baby's gonna like trying to learn how to swim yeah but now she likes it really cute how could you be a Savannah's want to go to another baking appointment so I guess I guess are they taking you weekly now is that what they decided to do tours in but we've kind of become like joked about it and a lot of the blogs about like Savannah's like feet swelling and obvious if you guys have been watching that is we kind of made like a light joke about it right but you are so swollen my hands are so swollen that I can't get my ring off my ring is stuck we've tried everything to get my ring off which is a whole nother story maybe we can try getting it off another time again but my ankles are Brad my legs are even starting to get bad and my eyes are starting to get bad which is weird so so bad i she's we do in essence all baths every night an ice pack that we keep in the freezer because like every hour we got a proper feet up until the ice pack on like we've downplayed it a lot of our videos like she's actually hurting really bad and I'm going to today I'm gonna tell them everything that's going on or a hopeful and confident that it's just towards you ever pregnancy she's falling into 30 I think it's just really hot I'm used to December being really big in December can both the girls I was huge summer now I'm huge in July so yeah it's a big difference of weather so I think I'm just we'll see she's going in right now and should she lie when she comes back so alright love you baby I wish I could come with you I'm not allowed to go later I'm still not allowed to go there so it's just there was one week where they allowed it and it was the one week where we where we didn't have anyone to watch Posey or Everly and so you have to save them because they're not all they weren't allowed to go there I've been able to do those HD or something so that's like yeah at least I been able to see the baby you're strong and you don't need no no man first one was sad first start myself now I'm like a pro at it big girl hello I was waiting for you every grandma's after horse baby's asleep at their swim you left so now I'm here you guys hear that if you guys have heard banging or and the off-chance you seen somebody so mr. cave as you can see we portions of our house entirely blocked off as well as back here I'll show you guys in a second but we have yeah so they're doing our baby nursery and they're doing a movie theater room but they like blocked it all off so we don't even see them and all their team is way masked and super safe but so basically we're just we don't see anything until the very last day when I leave yeah we have no ideas although we're in all that we know like before but we don't see like the old process because I can't say we literally haven't even seen them we can hear that like the behind the wall themself but they've done they've done such a good job but it's like blocking themselves off so even though they are in our home I'm gonna show you guys exactly what I mean they were math gloves they're Kings being the best about keeping us safe so here's our bedroom but they have the whole area where posies I mean babies these nurseries gonna be back there and then gears were pros he's sleeping right now but they have it blocked off on this side too so the nurseries right under this side I decided there and it's the same thing with the movie room look with the movie room is I got the very into the house anyway so it was even easier to block that room off also subscribe to mr. Kate's YouTube channel willing them down below because I'm not sure what they're posting but they're able to post a lot more than we are because they're doing all this stuff which is a little update will obviously talk a lot more remembers all done but he said that if my swelling gets any worse I didn't have to cut my ring off like whatever like like we should ice your hand and try and get it off they said that I'm a full centimeter I'm like a little over 7 meter now and I'm naked so that's more than I was outside because that's when I was barely a centimeter yeah baby he predicted that he thinks the baby's coming back 37 maybe 38 weeks so that would put us two weeks from right now but but they also have new coded protocol right you're telling on the phone now for the hospital we both get tested right away let me go in and get the results within an hour or before we were told that we were we would only get tested if we had a fever yeah so before they were always doing the fever and if you had a fever bin they would test you if you didn't have a fever than you were good but now what they're doing is they're testing you no matter what which is good because it keeps the nurses and doctors and everybody safe but now they're testing both of us so even if we didn't have symptoms and we're one of us test positive that cold kept in the room so Cole has a and I don't he can't be in the room if I have it if he doesn't I still can't be in the room - I have to have a baby by myself which was really sad and again we're not we're not like mad because we know that I it has to be done it just sucks now like we're having like the conversations of like obviously everybody's at horse camp we've been like letting pose you like the swimming classes like now we're like we've been seeing our close friends which is a lot you're allowed to be around yeah we've been seen our close friends and obviously Savannah's mom but we're always outside with our current state which is good like we've had little parties here and there and we've always stayed outside we haven't let people come in so you know that we feel like it's good to just being outdoors you know actually social distance and not like be touching like our close friends like we talked to all the time like they're doing a good job of only saying when it's okay so we feel like we've been doing our best without just making ourselves go crazy but now it's like we really really need to buckle down so these next three weeks I think three weeks yeah these next three and a half weeks were gonna really really buckle down not see a single person besides my mom my mom's not gonna say a single person either that's gonna be us here at the house just laughing again yeah we'll have a lot of downtime purple also a lot of nothing to do so we went to Arizona but other than Arizona we haven't I'm almost like thinking just I just like we're just gonna be going crazy here as so many of you guys are like a private house on a beach somewhere like we can't so go and be private you know but obviously this baby could come sooner like bag if your water breaks in a week then that's almost ideal you're strong you're stronger than I you sad we can't see our friends again yeah yeah I know we're about to start doing Bible studies outside in our backyard we're there with our friend group again but can't swim that and hose he's just waking up yeah she always plays there the bear and bunny in the corner Posie bear I love you did you hear dad dad did you hear dad dad yeah all right now we are getting a new car because we're gonna be having our baby I'm pretty sure we've attempted this quite a few times in vlogs before we've told you guys why we're getting a new car but we're finally gonna do it so when the seats are done it's fine there's lots of trunk space but we need Everly to go to the back seat out because we have the two babies that are gonna be on these seats so we need trunk space so guys there's our current ride here's the new one that we're looking at as you can tell it's pretty much the exact same thing just a lot more trunk space our car cuts off like here so we like this much a kind of trunk space we're going to need lots of grocery room yeah usually we get yeah that line is just like that sewed ready for the baby we got nursery almost done new car and we're ready pretty man   I'll just leave it just leave it father   so supposedly hot water gets the slime out of her hair we knew that his day was gonna come as much as every lesson it's very well we just came out with a video like my test ever your Jesus like oh I was GG was here four deities reacted     so it's funny because we actually got a slime and carpet what like two weeks ago how we put the slime is land on your head like how did it get your hair like that let's go brother right I think the horse was gonna be like the final bit you know you kind of needed a haircut anyways this morning okay I came in I came in I came in a tad late but it's alright baby the blog is over if you're joining in a big thumbs up subscribe if you aren't subscribed because this baby is coming ASAP you don't miss anything so be sure term post notifications so you don't miss anything and follow us on and scream right down here to keep up with us even more and we your shoutouts and every single blog to new follower so it's gonna be next for your shoutout just follow us on here this video shot up go to people who follow us in the last vlog so let's see what we got we got Kathy Babb ten we got am Alice OH -

and I like you okay elevate her hand so we elevate your feet when I got the pile of pillows and now we're putting we're running out of pillows because she sleeps like a crazy but I decided to go with pink for Manila because very bright blue and I don't want to draw more attention to my feet then so usually we get all the pillows from all around the room and we probably speed up as high as we can I should get that should just give us a love stuck up there for you oh no because then your booty can be in the bottom and your hold there hold worse your body like syncs up you know then we got her eyes pack right next to our sugar free popsicles so that we love so this is actually a heating pad and my mom makes them I'm my mom and my grandmother actually used to have like a website where they as a heating pad filled with corn not like popcorn but like the big ol corns like no other band the big old curtains and it's like you can microwave it and it gets warm and it's good for your muscles and that kind of thing but you can also freeze it in this case we've been putting on Savannah's feet every night because push about you oh yeah right yeah Wow okay so crushing there oh oh oh my oh my god oh yeah give him told him how bad you've been contracting well I know I mean it's kind of the rat snakes have gotten a lot stronger so I get like last night we almost ought that she was going into labor because if you have what so many contractions in like an hour I start timing them just because they were five minutes apart they were just braxton-hicks it wasn't like painful so and I was fine I have them in the middle of the night all the time but that's just kind of sleep through them or wake up to them and I like sleep I think other women who have Braxton Hicks knows know what you're talking about what I can you don't know if you're going into labor necessarily because it's like yeah you're always having little kind of contractions so it's like when the wind is the real thing and when it's not okay well guys y'all enjoy coming soon I'm so I'm so ready to have this baby mm-hmm I'm feeling so much pressure down there like I was doing the dishes tonight and I just where I hadn't

here's some new followers we got Ruby Marsden one we got 515 we got green eyes busy mind and pretty face rolling yes your name thank you much for fallen liking our pics and look at y'all I've been pregnant a way to love each other do they turn it out       come on let's roll good morning guys so from this video with a little bit of Bible reading and I finally here with me today where I wanna be reading this with her and it's gonna be coming from John chapter 14 verse 5 and 6 is where we're gonna be starting and just so you know what's happening this is right after Jesus died on the cross and right before he goes back into heaven and Thomas one of his disciples asked Jesus Lord we don't know where you're going so how can we know the way so they're asking I'm like how do we know how to get to heaven you know you're going to heaven how do we get to heaven and Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the Father except through me if you really know me you will know my father as well from now on you do know him and you have seen him so Jesus is saying that He is God that Jesus is God that Jesus and God of the same person and that the only way to get to heaven is through Jesus is through believing in Jesus so this passage is actually really controversial today and keep watching heard Jesus say this today they only think that he was being disrespectful to other religions saying that Jesus is the only way to heaven in reality Christianity into belief in Jesus is the most inclusive religion that there is it doesn't matter who you are what you've done what you haven't done the only thing that you need be at the heaven is to believe in Jesus and trust in Jesus that he has saved at his side of the cross for our sins and he's just being exact he's being specific and be like me telling a friend how to get to our house you know if there's only one way if there's only one road to get to our house and I say go down this road I'm here and at the very industrious barn house you will find our house if you take this treat if you follow my directions exactly but what if my friends said no I'm gonna go down to 41 I'm gonna turn the left instead of turning right and I'm gonna go down this road and then I'm gonna get your house I'm like you can do that if you want but you're not gonna end up at my house so I'm telling you how in my house Jesus is telling us how to get the heaven how to get to his father's house because He loves us so much he's being specific for a reason that's why that's what we believe that's not teaching Jesus you got any questions no you got it okay Wow enjoy the blog okay so its first thing the morning we just woke up and we're gonna do some fun because we've been in quarantine and going crazy and every favorite thing to do would you say that that this is your like number one favorite thing to do second or third we bought a bunch of huge bed sheets from Target big ones like because we I think what if we try and make blanket for it some blankets like don't work you know I don't you short right yeah the too heavy they see running up space they're really light so I you know this is how you suppose makeup like I mean look this is one too small one I mean we're gonna literally be able to cover this whole room we're gonna vlog the process and make the sickest biggest blanket board cuz it should take out this whole room and this is a pretty big room so I hope that we can make the sickest blingin for it okay put the kid to work   we use pretty much all the sheets it was harder than we thought we brought up so many chairs from downstairs got some extra blankets but it pretty much took up most of the room right yeah so I'm just going to show you guys how big it is from the outside all the way through gets high in the back whoa this is awesome alright well there's a hole in our blue a super awesome big blanket for it you name it something cool hey Evan who's that Oh Moe I was your new favorite thing hey Posie look we bought a blanket fort one side oh what's a blog we are at a baby appointment fun we're getting out of the house for some reason the hospitals and the laws and everything it almost changed on the changes on like a weekly basis so I can come so we drop the kids off at Grandma's we got our masks and obviously you guys know we've been quarantined about as good as we can try to do but if they're gonna let me in to see the baby then we're gonna be super careful an actual appointment yeah - I've gone to like your HD ultrasound thing yeah but that wasn't an appointment no it's like an actual appointment like this yeah this is this is exciting stuff for us and we're actually having an ultrasound today so and I think he's gonna check and see if I'm dilating can we just had the baby cuz you're in so much pain like usually your finger they will be totally healthy fine and big and he's he's good to come out   right now seven pounces oh yeah still got three weeks ago two and a half so this machine measures her contractions and I guess I see up there on the graph it's spiking cuz she's having a big one which this happens most days throughout the day yeah hey hey you you take my breath away the three centimeters dilated guys they tricked her hey I'm just kidding come on e day you're gonna say crazy stuff though the new car dropped off here it is looks just like the old one pretty much but like we said in a couple of logs back our car cuts off like here so we get like this much after cutting some space we're gonna oh yeah lots of grocery room longer back more room for the baby so cars officially here so we're officially ready nursery will be done today actually new car old car this is a cleanness this thing will ever look right in this area with the kids just crumbs and look at this so things so I guys can see looks exact same only difference really on the inside is that there's gonna be two TVs abz baby posy and then that way it can be back here and kind of have like a little space where I really actually really excited to like be back there by myself because I thought she was gonna be like a little sad because she's like super take our own little private spot a little private TV such as you watch like her big kid shows babies got the baby stuff but again big biggest reason trunk space kaboom honey hi so so are we gonna do VIN sound come on let me see you get gum yeah it's kind of a tradition we knew that like we were gonna do this and we're gonna go to type a little bit later but because it if you go but because she feels like the baby's coming tonight we're gonna add a I always think I'm a really long walk tonight she's going on that mission you this baby out we're gonna try to do the baby mom dance move we won't like they think of something really cool like a really like big and like different baby pompidou doesn't mean just like Sam and Nancy may always be yeah because I'm you really always

we do someone like dancer on the camera again so here we go that's right   supporting alright pay my rent your opinion is irrelevant you relevant customer baby mom I can do just what I like   Rominger please this is my mother oh my oh my okay hey i'm i'm okay but my water broke so just start heading over here when you can     way come on let's roll   hey guys welcome back to the vlog so it's actually the night before we upload this video and um i'm reading my bible and i want to share something with you guys so i'm reading out of uh romans chapter 1 verse 16. a lot of you guys have heard this and read this but for those of you who haven't i want to share it with you this is paul speaking and writing this book it says for i am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of god that brings salvation to everyone who believes and it goes on to explain so much more but i just want to keep it short and simple at that and i think that the big significance of where this is coming from is paul wrote so much of the bible so much of the new testament but before paul became a christian and before paul had an encounter with jesus he went by saul his name was saul and saul actually persecuted christians the same guy who wrote so much of the bible was essentially the most sinful man that you could imagine he hated christians he rounded them up in jesus days and he would have them brutally killed and then jesus had an intense encounter with saul as saul was on his way to kill christians jesus had an encounter with them and he said saul saul why are you persecuting my people and paul saul gave his life over to jesus became a christian started spreading the gospel everywhere saying this same god the same jesus that i've been killing now i have opened my eyes and i realized that he is the savior he is the risen god um so he says i am not ashamed of the gospel um i somebody who's the biggest sinner i somebody who have been killing christians i now am unashamed of this gospel so i feel like it's so significant and he goes on to be persecuted and killed himself for the gospel which is just as the bible says a beautiful thing so kind of intense but super awesome especially in the crazy world that we live in i want to encourage you guys to not be ashamed to not be afraid um to live out your faith and to be vocal about your love and belief in jesus so enjoy the vlog well hello you look so cute right now what do you eat popcorn that's yummy thank you we're gonna go on a family walk because we're trying to get this baby out really we're trying we're really trying to get this baby out she was three centimeters dilated a week ago she has a baby appointment coming up soon and if she's even more dilated then they might just let her have the baby especially because her contractions have been so bad recently her brexits are getting worse i'm swelling really bad he's sweeping my membranes on tomorrow we have a prediction that the baby's coming this weekend do yeah look at our look at our gate because we've had swim every single day for five weeks posey is an isr swimming lesson which i'll explain in a second but i'm gonna let them get in first and then i'll explain to you guys posey's an isr swimming lesson i heard about it a while back like when she was six seven months old because one of our neighbors actually did it with her daughters it just scared me like i didn't want to have to deal with her like crying in the pool or being scared of the pool because of it for me i was just really nervous to put her in it six months later i had a different neighbor reach out to me and i feel like it was a total god thing like her just reaching out she lost um her daughter from drowning when her daughter was around posey's age which is so sad but now she is like so inspiring she holds isr swim lessons at her house which is such a commitment she has people in and out of her house all day long for six weeks and she does this all the time you guys at first when we first put her in she was like crying and didn't like it and i was like oh maybe i don't want to do it anymore and then weeks later she was loving it so happy and so good the main thing about isr is it's all for safety so if a baby or a kid were to fall into the pool they know how to get to the edge how to swim to flow so six months to 12 months is just floating and then 12 months on they learn how to sweat posey literally knows how to swim now like she's 18 months old and she can swim she's like a little fish she loves it i feel so strongly about this like i want to encourage so many people to put their kids in this because it's so like just having the man there's a helicopter accidents happen and i would know i know now like i have such a piece of mind me and cole that like she would be able to get herself to the edge of the pool which is so cool it's just so safe and it's so awesome and just having a pool in our backyard it's so cool to see this little tiny baby swim in it are you ready is it cold one two three go   see see so she rolls over to float and then when she catches her breath again i'll give me one two three go she goes and gets them good girl good job one two three girl so she's totally doing this on her     step good job baby look she's not crying she's not upset she loves it can i go in yes you can do two one good hello everybody it is everybody and today we are doing something really special really special today we have been doing something that mean i really have been waiting for like um maybe like a couple days yeah not that long we haven't been waiting that long to do this but it's been a thought so we've been excited like well we probably think about it for like a week now i'm doing it i told you 37 weeks more believable it's my third baby like a lot of a lot of women have their third baby early um so i thought this was super believable to do the water break the water prank challenge what am i saying water break prank prank yeah on your husband on my husband yep water breaking prank on your husband or dad we are going to go on a walk because we've been doing this we've done this this is gonna be the second time that we've gotten a walk everybody convinced me to go home the other night and it was so fun but we went a little bit earlier so it's gonna be darker yeah if we're on a walk i'm having a lot of contractions i'm texting cole like i can tell them how close they are how close they are even if they're not close lie to give false information intentionally with intent to deceive after we'll come into the house and i'm thinking that what i'll do is i'll already just like wet like she'll have to she'll have a water bottle i'll leave the water i'll leave a water bottle maybe on the porch or something when we get back and i can pour it on myself and me and everything like frantically run inside and she's going to be my helper this time this is fun because last time and gigi's going to be on call and my mom is gonna help us i'm gonna tell gigi that she has to run over she has to watch the kids we're gonna make it super believable gigi's in on it um i think he's gonna believe us only for the fact that i've been having so many breaths and hicks every single night we think i'm gonna go into labor and then i don't i just sleep it off but it's believable it's believable and i have my little helper with me and she's a really good actress guys i have two ipods she has a just kidding this one's broken yeah back to the point um i'm thinking that we'll probably put a camera like facing when we get into the house no we could put it um we can put it facing the door so then you get us maybe i can put my phone facing him right when i get in too i have shorts on just to make it more believable i feel like i could like pour it all over my pour the water all over my shorts and then like have some water dripping down i'm gonna have it okay   have fun with it   i didn't get everly saying the first part when she walked downstairs but she walked into where cole playing fortnite was like mommy's having a lot of contractions so we're gonna go try to walk this baby out i don't think it's a good idea she's good all right ready we're actually gonna walk and we're actually gonna try to walk this baby out before we do this prank how funny would it be if i actually go into labor i know during this video okay ready yes okay so me and ev just got back from our walk i'm actually feeling really crampy lots of braxton hicks right now so the walk the walk helps but um are you so excited this is my mother oh my oh my okay looks like i'm like so gross ew and we have to make it seem like it broke as we're walking and then you know   all right   hey yes     okay   here i'll go get your phone   gg yeah my mom's water bro are you sure yes yeah i'm okay my mom my mom i hey i'm okay but my water broke so just start heading over here when you can   yeah she's coming uh       we that's why i kept asking you over and over   breaks you're not gonna believe the little girl who cried pregnant or labor oh man so you wanted to drink nah are you even i just poured a water bottle on me but i am having contractions if that helps   yes i'm totally fine we got him i love you i love you too thanks for not being mad at me that's okay did you really like for real you had no idea what you're continuing at all oh like she's like coming over just because like you're always contracting so much recently so it's like it seems like right you went on a now the other night it helped having everybody she's she's good at this she helps me like prank you all right good job pound it high five we did it we did it she's going into labor   come on let's roll   hey guys so still pregnant that

up to my water breaking   hopefully   i'm hello my wife is in labor and we are at the front of the hospital okay what is your name my name is cola brandt my wife's name's savannah lebron there he is best thing you can do sometimes it helps if you count   you guys ready       is this it everything what do you think i'm timing wait they're both timing how long these contractions are going on for this yeah don't show that's not nine minute long contracting i'm going backwards from ten but she's been having contractions for the past 30 minutes five minutes apart okay so i would say that they're like 50 seconds long so this is actually the first time i've ever brought the camera out i might delete this but it could be tonight i'm tired of them sorry i'm very into this right now this is the first time that they've hurt me that they've been painful and i'm cramping really low down here and a little bit in my lower back which i know means you're heading towards labor so we'll see this is kind of scary right now we're just kind of waiting i've never had them hurt me before because when i was four centimeters i got an epidural our thing is it's late at night it's 9 30. so we're trying to decide the hospital's like 20 minutes away do we go in have them check her out both the kids here so we'd have to call grandma to come over and watch the kids what did we just like fall asleep and see if my water breaks and i chance not getting an epidural but you don't want to risk not getting an effort also just i just told samantha whatever you feel with your body no i don't know i'm here to help i'll pick myself up and everyone's company oh okay i'm doing it it's like a number it's like a number exactly wait where am i all right that was two minutes two minutes apart so as y'all can see we've been it's 10 45. she's been having them since 8 56. um we're going in there   we're kind of delirious and we can't believe that it's actually happening right now i've never felt i mean i could be more than four right now but i've never felt four centimeters having contractions because i was getting at the draw like three this is painful i feel for those moms at l a a like apple b as in boy and then r-a-n-t all right we're getting out of here so every next time we come back this isn't the real deal then something's wrong with me this works bad next time we come back we could be bringing the baby back how crazy is that crazy and posey has no idea because she's sleeping i don't have a baby brother doesn't even know that there's a baby in my stomach we're just gonna be like all that posey noticed that she fell asleep we're gone for two days and we come back with a baby that's kind of sad okay all right have fun with gigi take care of your sister i love you   we love you bye take care of our house for us okay take care of your baby sister okay i'm gonna have one right now so let's go those hurt so bad   no not good no this isn't going to be like one of those happy vlogs like posey this one hurts really bad oh doing a lot of this recently we're honestly at this point just hoping that we make it to uh get her potter girl   you good also i'm pretty sure that they got to stick those that's gonna feel so good i'm pretty sure that we gotta get checked for corona virus so they're gonna have to shove those giant swabs into our brains and see if we can it's happening again that soon oh we gotta go baby make sure that you get your your shot can i like run in and like do anything i have no idea unless i hello my wife is in labor and we are at the front of the hospital i think you have a wrong number i do i know i i do i i'm actually i'm actually off one number okay sorry about that i was off a number sorry yeah yeah hello we are at the front of the hospital my wife is hello my wife is in labor and we are in the front lobby okay what is your name my name is cola brandt my wife's name is savannah brown you okay are you having one right now i hope i'm just being a baby and i'm like five centimeters or something you know yeah not like yeah good how are you i'm just gonna grab your time go for it any um exposure to anybody with covet any shortness of breath fever no skills yeah i think this guy's coming now yeah little boy first boy there he is best thing you can do sometimes it helps if you count so count that count in four five go out for five there you go this other monitor's going to be through contractions   another one yeah what the heck breathe through it together okay pump this fist a couple times for me there you go just like that deep breath in blow it out good job you're gonna hold your hand just like that okay   yes you're doing awesome okay it's almost over it's almost over so she is seven centimeters um that happened really fast because yesterday or the day before i was four she was just four and she's having just contraction after contraction right now and i feel so bad for her because these are some big ones they're they're hoping and rushing to get the epidural in time all just like in the car breathe and try not to tense up so much she has two to three minute breaks and then they're so much stronger from when i got here too so when we got here i was seven so i at least have to be an eight   nope he's doing it right now   all right guys she did it she got the epidural i did it how happy are you right now happy i'm not being construction though they just gave it to her so it's still hurting but oh there's nothing like how it was still hurts but you're not yelling oh it's so much better see this is nothing compared to what it was obviously and he has been out there who has a wife who hasn't had an epidural nose but she i've never seen savannah yell in pain and she was yelling so loud and it was the hardest thing for me to watch oh my gosh i'm so happy that i did that thank god for medicine thank god for good medicine how how do people do this without one they're just like could you imagine pushing the baby out without it there's like superheroes you're a superhero yeah you're superior but i didn't go all the way doesn't matter you're almost eight centimeters if we still had like four more hours of this and i had to go for three four more hours of those and they get worse and worse without enough people do it oh my god a hundred years ago everybody did it all right well it's backwards but it's 12. i mean it's 203. four centimeters two ten centimeters and three hours it's ten centimeters and for those of you don't know what that means that means it's time to push crazy this is crazy they just checked her look how bad she's shivering yeah the shivers i'm not cold at all but it just means it's ready it's time to go it's time to go it also sucks because the doctor who we've been who delivered posey the doctors we've been dealing with this whole time he doesn't wake up until 5 00 a.m and get here but still wait a way that i can yeah you can't hold the baby he is there and he is ready to go hey but hey but how's that epidural feel right now because we haven't even done an update it's also good i love epidurals so actually we haven't even so did epidural i updated you guys last night i think what happened she brought in pillow because we were going to take a cat nap she said take a cat nap lay down i think i fall asleep for like five minutes i hear savannah go my water broke so her water broke on her own which is fine because last time that didn't happen they broke your water it's funny my water never breaks on its own but it took it took it to get to 10 centimeters 10 full centimeters but good thing you didn't break on its own at the house because go tell her i'm feeling a lot what's happening i don't i don't know what's happening i'm just feeling okay okay i can deliver if i have to okay babe they said i could be wrong but i'm just telling you just yeah no they said they said they said for me to put gloves on yeah yeah whatever okay did you tell my mom told your mom yeah that's what you what did you say and she doesn't take it back here crazy i guess we'll just send you a picture of the baby good thing we came here when we did good thing you came here like an hour later i probably wouldn't have been able to get an epidural right you would have definitely delivered without the effort yeah great honestly maybe like 30 minutes later what people say about third baby is so accurate oh man i don't know if i'm ready for this are you ready this is the real question yes yes yes i'm ready okay you're good i'm gonna grab all my stuff i need for delivery okay okay i'm not going far 2 a.m all of our babies are too yeah that's what your mom was saying oh my goodness evan posey came through but but posey was 2 p.m yeah but still too was your last one at 2 p.m yeah she was 2 like 2 12 but everything i think was like 2.05 pretty cool my mom literally so we better be so weird how did you guess that she said you're gonna have all of your babies in the tubes can you film all right i think he's bald yeah that's insane she's feeling them right now she can feel him right now oh my gosh i can't even hear you giving him a headroom getting so nervous trying to spiritually communicate for him to stay in there for 10 more minutes timmy oh manzie come on we got it crazy oh my gosh this is whenever the camera starts getting really shaky that's

hazy man hey i'm your dad dad hey i know i'm a little scary at first z we we're like the only men in the house look at you hey hey it's okay hi hi hey i'm your dad hey look at you buddy you're so calm we could use that in our house maybe we can teach your sister something oh my goodness it's your birthday   july 29th july 29th buddy are you kidding me we're gonna see how much you weigh we're gonna see how strong you are seven pounds seven two seven two seven two seven two you hey you were one ounce heavier than your sister one ounce heavier than your sister   it feels like we were just doing this exact same thing it feels like it was not that limited what the heck like literally this exact same thing he's looking up at you like posey was looking over you oh my gosh he's so chill   what the heck this happens so fast we were about to go to bed he started saying he was having contractions and the next thing we're here oh my god oh i love him so much how did you do that look at him he's just like so we have to have like nine more of these let's just focus on this one look at him he's just oh he's so he's so happy like he doesn't even know what's going on he just knows he has his mama you probably hear your heartbeat the same heartbeat inside of you i love it look he's like so so happy not sure what posey's gonna do hello   hello   all right we had our baby we got our babies feeding them we got wheelchairs out of like the delivery room and now we're in the what room is this i don't know it's like the room where you go after before you get to go home um so obviously with covered protocols and other things like we just got to kind of stay in here for 24 hours they'll monitor the baby and make sure everything's okay but that was honestly i mean you can't ask for a better delivery just as quick and it was amazing except for all the pain that you were in it's so painful but in the beginning once i got my epidural guys because i didn't get that until the very i don't even want savannah to try to speak and brag for herself i wasn't watching at all and she didn't get an epidural until she was literally nine or even 10 centimeters which is full like full as strong as the contractions can get and luckily they gave her the epidural and it kind of like calmed her down so it slowed the process down a little bit but all i have to say is if you're about to have your third baby you need to run to the hospital because the third baby just flies out of you but savannah was just a total rock star i mean i didn't vlog it obviously because it's like i said hard to watch and i didn't want to be too evasive in that because i don't get any of it i got one on my phone just just so that you can watch it you know i thought maybe like you would want this but she was just i'm not gonna put in the vlog because it's sad but she was just screaming i mean savannah does have a high pain tolerance but she was just yelling that hurt like yelling loud i don't wish that pain like bloody murder yelling anybody our doctor who we've been using i don't even know if we said this but he didn't deliver the baby they had had to call somebody down the street not someone just a doctor but healthy baby healthy savannah for now so that's all that we could have asked for you guys might have kind of seen this like i don't like it didn't necessarily go perfectly like whenever the baby first came out whenever z first came out they laid z on savannah and if you guys saw the video you see obviously he looks super purple and and all that and didn't think too much of it because all babies looked super beat up when they first came out but he wasn't crying and i'm sure this is super common too like i'm sure it happens all the time but yeah he wasn't crying at all so like you could tell the nurses were all nervous and it was making us super nervous and just they took him from me and like tried to get stuff out of his lungs he was he was laying on her limp for a little bit so i actually put the camera down and because it really scared us we tell that to scared the nurses but the nurses took him and got him to cry but that was actually really scary for us so other than that he cried and came to and now he's eating and nursing and perfectly good so we're just excited to hopefully get out of here sooner than later and if all's good and go show everly and posey they're gonna be so excited everyone's gonna be super excited posey has no idea that poison's gonna be so confused i'm like more excited to see oh baby i'm kind of like i know everyone's just gonna be so obsessed and it's gonna be the cutest thing ever but i'm almost just like so excited to see posey's reaction because i have no idea what to expect i know so here's our delectable lunch that we get at the hospital cheeseburger for me some apple juice chocolate pudding booyah an apple an apple they keep the doctors away and savannah i've got some baked leaves and some good old wet bread turkey sandwich turkey sandwich that's savannah's favorite food in the world actually so i'm i'm actually favorite turkey sandwich so two things first off savannah tested negative for covid so they actually had to test her negative i didn't get tested but no fever or symptoms so luckily it has had to get tested um two they might be letting us go home tonight so usually they don't let you go home until 24 hours after the baby the baby was born at 2 42 so that would mean that we won't go to leave until tomorrow morning actually let you leave at two in the morning but because baby's super healthy this is savannah's third baby um and i'm doing really good she's like not bleeding too much and stuff yeah she's doing good herself babies doing good we're confident and comfortable i think they can let it go home tonight so i'm looking at this pain tolerancy thing and i remember asking savannah last night right after her contractions what she was a one to ten but now she's in like a different state of mind with the baby how one to ten one to ten what was the contractions that you had to when say at the house 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life you're at the house one like that was fine i can do like five six centimeters contraction so those are fine i went to the hospital i was seven right yeah those were getting more painful like i would say those were probably like four and then those ones closer to my epidural like when i was hitting nine ten centimeter centimeters that was the worst pain i've ever felt in my entire life it literally it literally feels as if someone is takes a knife and it's like slowly cutting you from the inside up from the inside out yes or just by your stomach area yes that's really what i'm like like i don't even know how to explain so if it literally feels like somebody has a knife and they're just okay well we can't get so it gets so gruesome but it's literally the worst thing about well i don't know what it feels like and like i think the scariest part is you know that they're going to keep happening you know you know what's going to happen again i know i felt so bad for you because it was like the anticipation was like don't go away and then you you're like shaking you're shaking literally like it's going to happen again it's going to happen again in all he's doing good they just think he might have a little bit of jaundice he's so sweet we've been very blessed so far he doesn't cry so far he just chills so we made the morning we had a good night with little man and they're letting us go home so his jaundice didn't get worse and they said it's all right so we're gonna monitor that as we go home and just take them into the doctor tomorrow and check them out yep are you doing so good he's doing so good so much last night lots of sleep lots of eating lots of pooping see how he sleeps tonight his first time on the binky right here first time on the mickey figuring it out the girls are gonna freak out oh man look at your outfit buddy you're so ready to go home your first time going home funny stories we were filming our our nursery tour and we were about to put that video up for wednesday's video but then we had the baby so yeah if you guys saw we have to redo it not long ago savannah posted a q a saying hey we're gonna post a q a tomorrow and so we did the q and a in the q a we showed you guys the nursery um but she went to labor later that night so obviously we didn't want to post like a q a about the pregnancy yeah while we had the baby so kind of postponing all that because little man had to make a grand entrance   first stop savannah want me to vloggers but we are starving after a bunch of hospitals i am not eating this not he is eating oh mcdonald's can i getting starbucks can i get a sausage i can cheese my griddle z-man did great in the car thank goodness this guy's posie is not a good car baby calling it day one not sure what he's gonna do   hello hello hello hey hey look look yeah how is he look it's a baby   you should go sit down on the couch but even have them in between the neighborhood   hi are you so excited to meet your little brother

no okay you know what go wash your hands wash wash those hands as good as you've ever washed them we were gone for two days and we come back with a baby what the heck   got to keep you all clean because you know you're a mess oh you want to hold it hold on i said so you just gotta remember like how posey was whenever she was first born his neck everything you're just gonna look so soft with you know like he can't even move his neck look look you can give him a kiss give him a kiss yeah be gentle do you like his hat what do you think is he so little what does he smell like cause i remember you telling us what pose you smell like the first time he smells him he doesn't smell like anything he doesn't no look how cute nope the baby's sleeping we're not expecting this out of position we knew everything's going to look like i was going to be this adorable but so i want to see his hair let's see it you want to see the baby's hair i'll see his hair he actually has here i think you guys both came out bald whoa he has a lot okay do you want to give the baby his binky yeah yeah okay ready are you so excited this is cute   see the binky her hands are good right you can

baby's mouth like this let's see see if he'll take it he's kind of asleep so he might not even want it hey does he like it hey how does he like movies yeah he had one in the car okay soft girl yep look let's see if he wants it don't push it down gently yeah you can yeah um   he's awake now what do you think of i like him he looks so tiny on you she's beyond them toes that's her big she's gonna be holding you a lot i bet she loves holding the babies who do you think he looks like you kind of well and in facetime he looked like posey whenever he was born but not really anymore yeah now he's starting to look like his own little person huh so we're getting z-man's baby stuff built and posey just wants to be in it baby you want the baby this is gonna be interesting oh look at her oh you want the baby with you sleep with you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you're so cute   no no no more can you give him a kiss you give him kisses oh it's sushi soft pizza oh all right it's our first night a little z about to put him down in his bassinet and i think that z man broke a world record for pooping another day in a day for a newborn baby number seven let's hold his foot like make sure he poops like at least two times oh he's good he is eating and pooping everything out of them there's a no promo but i know savannah gets asked to give it what her favorite newborn baby parts are it's my favorite thing ever owlette sauce see outlet sock it tracks like the heartbeat have the baby make sure that he's sleeping okay can you sleep otherwise if i don't know that he's okay i won't sleep savannah's asleep much her first couple months of the baby being born because she has newborn baby paranoia i think like so many people can relate to but this gives her a lot of peace of mind again that's not even getting paid or anything to say this we truly love it and everybody loves him foreign now this is weird two babies in car seats i know some people three doesn't seem like a lot put to us all of a sudden three seems like it's like a full house we got a full house a full family and we're going to the first uh going from one to two was like didn't seem like anything going from two to three seems like the biggest we're outnumbered we're outnumbered but we're going to the his first little uh doctor's appointment thing checkup he's still only like i'm gonna probably two days old i think so i'm gonna check it out oh little guy okay six pounds okay a little update so we're at our pediatrician because 24 hours after you have your baby they usually want to do a checkup especially because it looks like z had uh jaundice um not severe but enough to where they wanted to check out by him the next day they checked him out he's looking pretty good but our pediatrician said that he's looking a little yellow and that he wants to re-get his jaundice levels checked um so savannah had to go back to the hospital that's where she's been she's at the hospital right now with z um and they're retesting his blood to see what his i think is like bilirubin levels if your bilirubin's high that means that you got like a lot more or a lot worse of a case of jaundice if it's lower that's better i guess his just came back and it's in the critical area so savannah and z gotta stay overnight at the hospital so that the nurses can monitor him and make sure that it doesn't get worse he'll do some kind of light therapy on him to try and boost his his blood levels and um yeah again we don't know much but i guess he just has really bad jaundice and um it's not super rare it happens in a decent amount of babies but obviously at the end of the day all that we ever wanted was just savannah to be safe and healthy with the birth baby to be safe and healthy and um he's pretty healthy but not as healthy as he can be so trusting the doctors i feel so bad for savannah because she is just exhausted the first couple days of having a baby or just really tiring because you don't get too much sleep especially her being up breastfeeding him throughout the night and so much stuff so having to go back to the hospital and sleep in a hospital that's not near as comfy as our cozy home um i feel bad for her so i'm about to head out drop some stuff off for her and she's gonna stay tonight bless you bless you posie   so made it to the nicu with savannah you've been here for what you've been here for like five hours already yes maybe longer we thought you were just gonna get some blood work done on the baby and hopefully get some good results and come back but the results didn't come back as good as we were hoping and so now he's so i spent the last four hours crying my eyes out savannah was crying a lot now i'm just happy that i could be here she's crying obviously because it's sad news but also because she wasn't sure often times in nicu and in this situation they make the moms go home so that's what i was told at first because i was gonna have to go home so i was just a mess but savannah gets to say the night i get to stay here i'm a little happier so i brought her some lasagna and clothes and toothbrush and all that and but this i didn't i wasn't expecting this i walked into this and it made me so sad they got him under these lights that are supposed to bring down his uh bilirubin levels they're obviously monitoring him and just want to see how he's doing the next couple days so   this is where where we'll be swapping off for the next few days we got grandma home with the kids right now but definitely not not ideal whenever you have a new baby   as long as we get a little baby healthy that's all that matters   well that's probably the saddest thing i've ever had to deal with was there for a few hours and i think on top of it we're just both exhausted and just want to be home with our whole family just want to be at home with our new baby i mean it's been i think two full days i'm really losing track of time but we had a good first day and obviously we know that it could be a lot worse and we don't want to look at the bad side and stay positive and count our blessings and stuff but um yeah i just feel so bad for savannah she's just i've only seen savannah cry probably a handful of times maybe 10 times total in our whole marriage she was just a wreck today every time i called her on the phone and i think it was just unexpected and she saw so much pregnancy hormones and but i i think it was more so that she was she didn't want to leave her new baby who obviously isn't doing too well at the hospital by himself because with everything going on with covin and so much other things um a lot of parents and different hospitals and situations and things aren't able to stay with the nicu baby they gotta leave the baby overnight and that's just not savannah she was gonna she was telling me that she was gonna sleep in the car right outside the hospital and just be on call and be ready um she's just the best mom in the world and so i've just been praying all day i i don't even know what to say we we don't know this is obviously just all in god's hands and um we're hoping and praying for the best there's so much blood work that is coming in tomorrow so we're just hoping and praying for the best it might not even be the jaundice that is really getting to him it could be some kind of infection um so we're really just hoping for the best that those billy reuben numbers are high which lets us know that there's some he's battling something and we assume it's jaundice they assume it's jaundice but until the blood work gets back it could be some kind of infection so um i i we initially thought it was going to be uh an overnight thing maybe a 24-hour thing but it's sounding more like it's going to be a two three four day thing um at best if he if he gets under control if not it could be longer but honestly at the end of the day we just want a healthy baby just want a healthy baby however however that needs to be so just uh be in prayer we just trust god in times like this it's uncertain and it's scary and it sucks and we know that we aren't the only parents dealing with this thing could be so much worse so um we're just i'm just praying for my wife praying for sweet little baby z and my girls at home we just want our family all to be together and be safe and healthy and that's all that matters that's all that matters nothing else matters but i don't i don't know what else to say well we'll keep you guys updated as we find out stuff tomorrow so i'm gonna get some rest it's late it's leaving the hospital again at let's see 10 42 so gotta get some rest all right for day two we got some chick-fil-a drop off savannah's been here a long time hi guys i feel so bad for savannah i feel so bad for our baby but i dropped her off starbucks this morning and i didn't vlog or bring the camera but she had been crying all morning long and i showed up and she just stopped crying   anytime i say the word anytime i even bring up crying   because i can't i'm so bad at this stuff like any time that any of our kids get sick something happens like i get major anxiety and i start like stressing out like i won't eat for days at a time and like i know it's not healthy that's not good but with kid stuff so like with this this advantage is like so strong and she just she most the time holds it all in but she's finally letting it out which is like so many pregnancies too anyone who like just had a baby can relate you're just like so like something i've been like seeing usually if you walk in you don't talk to me about crying i'd be like blowing my eyes out right now that's happened this morning but we got chick-fil-a yeah we'll update you guys on the baby he's doing okay but they whenever i bring food they send us back in this little little private room just because we're on the we're on the what the neonatal floor the nicu floor so they obviously got to keep it as sanitary and clean actually like really surprised that they landed which is really cool they let me and i don't see a lot of parents at all in here so it's just the best experience as far as the nurses and the help that we're getting so i'm so thankful for that but so they've been letting savannah actually take him out just to breastfeed he can come out for 30 minutes every three hours so we get to have goes huh the most important things for him right now is that he eats good yeah that he poops good and that he gets lots of time under the incubator lights and he's doing all those so um the blood work also came back i said he had no other infections of any kind so fortunately it's just the jaundice um which is what what we're hoping for so we'll get some john december's back later in today and hopefully they're hopefully the better so cute it so i just relieved savannah letting her go home see the kids because she hasn't seen them in almost two days now so she's going home and uh i'm gonna be with everly and posey and shower and sometimes it's like two o'clock so she'll be able to hang up there until night time because he's definitely got to stay at least another 24 potentially 48 hours it all depends on what his numbers come back with so i'll be here with baby for a little bit and so sad i hate seeing him in this thing but it's for the good they added another light so it looks brighter they added that big boy up there to boost his levels and get him better       all right so it's night two that i'm leaving um savannah wants to stay again obviously it's it's best if she stays just because she's got the milk and needs to breastfeed him and all of that um i keep extending the offer that if you want to pump your milk i'll stay you can go home and wake up with posey and everything in the morning and sleep in our bed but she's just the best mom in the world so obviously she just wants to make sure that she's by her newborn who's um recovering in the hospital so she's going to sleep by him but we've just been trying our best between the both of us just swapping back and forth so that we can still go home and be with everyone posing and spend time with them um but also be with the baby so and also be with each other so we'll have an hour here and an hour there where we're both in the nicu and spending time with each other so we're just kind of losing track of time because this has all just been a whirlwind you know we went in in the middle of the night to have z um he was born at 2am and we didn't get any sleep that night or really the next night uh we were in the hospital for like two days with him and then we went home and everything was good and uh saw the girls and we were with our family slept that night the next day had the pediatrician thing um and then he told us to go to the hospital to get blood work done and honestly he did not expect it all to have to stay at the hospital so that's whenever stayed there last night tonight it's happening and will most likely be another night or two unless if his test results come back even better which we're just praying and trusting god for but at the end of the day no matter how long it takes we just went healthy baby um it's really wearing on savannah i think she's just exhausted for every right reason um i mean that along with just the hormones that come after having a baby um so postpartum's no joke but um she's she's so strong and i love her so much and um we're gonna we're gonna come stronger from this and we believe that so um i'm going to go home be with the kids and uh check in with savannah and the baby in the morning so it's day three of mama and the nicu yeah and uh everyone to hang out with grandma a little bit get out of the house for a little bit she was with us this morning yeah yeah look i'm talking to the vlog he said hi and i'm about to go and swap off with mama so then mama can have some baby in every time everyone's going to meet us at the hospital and i'll stop off so i'll be there but t i've realized that posey and the kids other than z really haven't been in the vlog at all so i want to show you guys that they're still around we've just been exhausted and not doing the best job at filming and documenting this but like we said most importantly just getting baby and the whole family healthy and back home so but we actually got ready and we're about to go see mama so we're excited right you wanna go see mama baby and baby she's walking out saying baby can you say baby can you say hey can you say mama mama so it's day three and i just pulled up to the hospital and me and savannah are about to swap off so she's super excited just to get out of there for a little bit like i said she wouldn't want to leave the hospital and leave the baby there all by himself but it's good to come out and see the kids so here she is getting to see a little posey bear for the first time in a little bit so she's pretty excited and gigi's dropping her off with you right oh yeah they'll be here any minute i miss you all right so it's morning four i think three or four um and z and mama were supposed to come home today and um because he's been doing better he every day he's been in there he's been doing better his numbers were really high which isn't good if they get too high it can result in brain damage and luckily the doctors and nurses have been taking great care of them having wondered that light therapy as you guys have seen and it's bringing his numbers down if his numbers were good they took him off of the lights to make sure that his numbers stayed low without the light therapy um so that's what we were hoping for that's what we were praying for that's what we're believing in um and so i came back last night i was here with the kids this morning savannah's there the baby and they test his numbers we're waiting on the results um and they come back not the best they his numbers went right back up without the light therapy yeah it's just it sucks not not knowing why that's happening nobody really has answers so instead of him and savannah coming home today um they gotta stay longer how long we don't know i'm just trying my best to just remind us to not lose hope to not um get so down and disappointed and frustrated and angry because i know that that's what the enemy that's what the devil would love to do in the season is for us to waste it i know you guys have probably heard the saying don't waste your cancer obviously this isn't isn't cancer but it's just a saying that in in in tough and hard times don't waste it don't be down in the dumps you can learn so much from it you can grow so much from it and that's what i truly believe that god's doing from this and i'm just i'm reminded of this verse that i want to share with you guys in the bible it's um romans 5 romans chapter 5 verse 3 and it says not only so but we also glory in our sufferings we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope and hope does not put us to shame because god's love has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit who has been given to us obviously this is very mild suffering we we are so aware compared to so many other people so many other situations but in this time it doesn't feel good it feels like why us why is this happening why can't the baby just be healthy and good and we'd be home with our family and resting because we're already exhausted and you can just keep piling on things it's covered my family hasn't even seen the baby they're in florida like so many things that we can just pile on that oh poor us but we want to rejoice in our sufferings because suffering produces perseverance perseverance produces character and character hope and we have hope in jesus and that's nothing can break that but this also goes on to my literally almost most favorite um scripture in the bible it says you see at just the right time when we are still powerless christ died for the ungodly very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person though for a good person someone might possibly do to die but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us so it just goes on to just pretty much just proclaim the gospel that we have power in christ because while we're still sinners while we were still dead and our sin jesus came and jesus died for us and that's how much he loves us so we have hope in that we have hope in jesus and we have hope and these great and blessed and talented doctors who i'm god's put in our hands so um yeah i don't know how long we're gonna be here for but um we're hopeful we're confident and i'm about to go to the hospital right now check in on sav do the swap out thing where she comes back with the kids i hang out there all day and um just praying for the best all right make sure you say good okay this is the first time that like it's gonna be said okay okay you ready well we're gonna say it a lot we're gonna say a lot i'm saying this is the first time so you gotta make sure that you like pronounce it good and i guess sounds cool all right ready here we go drum roll   all right dad's here for a visit still here feeding the baby we're doing um formula instead of breast milk right yeah because forming was supposed to help drop the numbers his numbers went back up when they took the light away so he only had the blanket light um but when they took this light away his number spiked back up to 17.8 i think which is really high whenever we first bought our menu like 19. it was 19.8 and then it went down to 13.7 which was great and so they were thinking of sending us home this morning if the number came back lower than 13.7 and they totally thought it was going to be but it came back at 17.8 which is really high so i've been a mess all morning but i'm doing better now and we found that when i talked to the doctor he said that doing formula switching over to formula can help him break it faster so i'm just pumping every time that we feed him formula so then when we get home i can still breastfeed him but the formula should help us get out of the nicu faster just right now so we'll do formula today and tomorrow and hopefully leave tomorrow if his numbers go down but if they don't then we'll still be here so that's what's what's happening and i'm about to head out i'm gonna head out   savannah's gonna stay here and pump for a little bit then i'll be back what like an hour or two and we'll stop out so you'll go home for the night i'm trying to convince her because she's been here for three nights in a row trying to convince her because the baby's own formula anyways to go and sleep at home sleep at home and i'll sleep here on this comfy couch bed with the baby you should you should get some sleep baby literally since the baby's been born you haven't gotten more than like three hours of sleep a knife i can see it in your face people look me in the eyes you're losing it honey no i'm fine i don't want to i don't want to sleep away from him that's sad i'll come back we'll talk about it yeah we'll talk about it think about it   now we're doing the trade-off doing the trade-off doing the baby he go oh posey's obsessed with this baby right now it's kind of heavy though eva's swimming with one of her friends right now her new friends ooh everybody has a swimming with a friend so you'll be here i missed you so i might have going there is kind of what we've been doing i'm gonna go in there relieve savannah for a little bit let her hang out with the kids i'm going to go in um and hang out with z man and i'll get his new test numbers in a couple hours which we just really hope we're good if they're good then we might be getting out of here soon if they're not good then we i have no idea if they're not good we have no idea what's gonna happen so daddy's gonna go bye bye can give me a kiss   very nice thank you hey i love you hi so something else is cool cause while you're in here they teach you cpr and obviously this is a dummy baby fake baby pretty cool that we will have this in our back pocket if we ever need it so we just got a test results back um i'm gonna remind you guys of what his numbers were so billy rubin is essentially what gives babies jaundice and if the billy ruby is too high it can cause brain damage um for his age they said that 24 25 the number 2425 billy rubin can cause brain damage whenever he brought him in he was in 19.7 which is pretty high not high enough to hurt him at all but they put him into the light therapy and it brought it down um and brought it down to an 18 the second 10 that we tested which wasn't as good as their winning but then the second time it brought it down to a 13 which is really good news and then they took them off with the light therapy and it shot back up to a 17 which wasn't good because that's whenever we were hoping to go home this morning so they just tested him again and it went from a 17 down to a 15. so they're hoping for a 12 they said so it's kind of in the middle um so he's staying in the lights and we're going to kind of see what he's at in the morning i think i might have convinced savannah to stay home so i might be doing the night shift here but we'll see i just want her to be able to get some good sleep um at home and not stress out of the baby i don't know if she's even gonna be able to sleep at the house but i really just want her to be able to spend more time with the kids and not sleeping on this little hospital couch but he'll be there little buddy i'll be here um i'm just praying all night that we'll get some good numbers back get some good numbers back we've been here for a while and just ready to go home have our family back together i'm dating i convinced savannah to let me stay the night you all be praying for her because she hasn't made your anxiety not being here with a baby but she needs sleep so i'll spend the night with my big man   can you tell i'm exhausted look   they said he's been doing good so they're letting me hold them for 30 minutes and feed them hey you get to move your data for a little bit say hi everybody say hi everybody you're so cute we love him so much we love you so much already you're gonna do such awesome things one day you could be a world changer you know that look at you we love you so it's day five and um we're just tired i let savannah sleep at home last night and i was there with him last night and now i know why savannah's so emotional and it's just i'm waiting in the car to go inside because i don't even want somebody to see me upset but we just every morning we hope for the news that his numbers are good and we can take him home and we just didn't get that this morning again so they're going to run some more tests and try and figure out what's wrong with them and how to get him better but we just want to take him home so i just put up to the house and it's tough because i don't want savannah to see me like this i don't want the girls to seem like this because it's really hard for all of us right now and i just want to go inside and it's hard to it's hard to put on a mask and pretend like i'm okay but we're believing that he's gonna be okay she's hard it's hard sorry i told the vlog i was gonna try not to come inside and cry   hospital makes you exercise i think i   postpartum   i actually took a shower yeah but now you gotta go back to that place yeah i gotta go back and get sad you gotta go back to the sad place that room is just like so depressing i know it's so sad seeing him in there knowing that you can't do anything about it it's night um what night is it night five but this is savannah's first time holding him and like a good bit because i was with him all last night and then all day today we've kept him in there to get as much light as possible so i've been able to hold him all day so this is a blanket that shoots light into where he sleeps so that thing lights up they got a light on top that thing lights up and then they bring in the big mac daddy light where they shine this guy on them so he is just because he's getting lit and we still don't have answers we go through like mega highs and lows as you all saw i think last time i vlog i was an emotional wreck she's been an emotional wreck we've been like major this right now we're kind of okay but we don't have answers he let me sleep last night which was i didn't think i was going to be able to do that i kept texting him like okay maybe let's just switch back she told me she told me to set my alarm for 1 30 a.m and ask the night nurse if she if if i could come in if she could come in at 2 am like is that allowed and it wasn't loud but she said she's left i made myself i'm happy i knew it would be good for me and i knew we'd probably have a couple more days here so i need to i need to sleep you know but right now it's just late at night they're doing a bunch of tests in the morning and as of now we know nothing we know nothing besides the fact that this is a very rare case of jaundice that they don't really understand what's going on yeah they said that usually janda's case is out of here in like two days so i'm almost hoping that like someone watching this video like knows a doctor or know something that that can help us and if you do help us help us email us because they just want to know more you know this is so sad it's like not what you when you have a baby it's like not what you imagine in your head you imagine like going home especially with other kids in the house yeah going home being with family people coming to visit like already with like covert and everything going on and it already being the stream time to have a baby and then this happening on top of it is so sad so cute so z-man oh sorry z-man wakes up from like nine to like 9 30 to 2. hang on this is my favorite he's just awake right now we love it it's sad because they're about to put him back in the in the chamber and they got to put the goggles back on him and it's so sad when he's awake i don't know but we we really soak in these moments with them right buddy hey you got two sisters at home who are so ready for you to come back can you get better so we can go play with sissies you got some fun sisters you guys that's him he's so little that's him look his little foot is like almost by his face he's so cute guy you're my little man that i can't wait to play soccer with you   hey guys so i'm at the house of dev right now um savannah is still at the nicu with z um and it's actually day seven right now i'm about to go to the hospital and we have a bunch of uh updates for you guys a lot of new info i i kind of stopped vlogging day by day just because i don't think this is a day by day thing and it's turning out to be a much longer thing but we see your guys questions we hear you guys and we know that you guys want to know the name and um obviously we wanted z to be here we wanted to have him in our home we wanted to um announce the name with him and it doesn't feel right doing it in the sad nicu environment and we know how excited everly is to share it with you guys so we thought that we would let her share the name with you guys before i go and meet up with savannah um for all the nicu and baby updates so you want to tell them the name okay okay so are you ready to tell them yeah jump no you do know okay here we go drama we saw a lot of guesses of this you ready drumroll   oh wait just kidding psych okay we had to throw that in there because we saw a lot of zions and honestly i think that zion's such a cool name but it's not the baby's name we also saw a lot of zekes not the name we saw a lot of zayn's not the name we saw a lot of everything honestly except for the name um oh here's a gigi's dog gigi's also going to say hey hey me hey okay so the real name is you do drumroll are you nervous kind of it's been secret for so long now everybody's about to know all right make sure you say good okay this is the first time that like it's gonna be said okay okay you ready well we're gonna say it a lot we're gonna say a lot but i'm saying this is the first time so you gotta make sure that you like pronounce it good and like it sounds okay i ready here we go drum roll oh very oh that was perfectly set great reveal it is zlatan new zealand that's that's our little boy's name baby z is baby zealand um we've had that name picked out for so long and we love it do you like it yeah we reveal it we all love it and we can say it as much as we want on the vlogs i'll probably still call him baby z my little z guy i saw a lot of people thinking it was uh zemen because i was saying z man so y'all thinking it was zeeman or something if you don't like the name we don't care because we love the name so if you don't like the name and you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all because we love the name and that's all that matters right yeah and zealand is an awesome name and i wish that my name was zealand because my name's just cool but his mail and if you guys are curious his middle name is cole we want zealand coal cool   okay so it's officially been a full week since we got here almost exactly a little over a week but by the time you guys are watching this i'm sure we will still be here so it'll be eight days um new zealand i can say his name now hello zealand let's see if we can find his tag on him new zealand c lebron in the very first nicu video we honestly thought that we were just gonna have a two three day nicu experience so i kind of i kind of documented it i thought it was just going on like a one-night thing and they weren't letting me out the next morning i totally didn't think anything like this was gonna happen but once after like day fours kind of guys stop vlogging and i haven't picked it up since then just because every day has been worse it's tough people are out like people like ask us like is it getting better and the answer is no it's not getting better can't i mean i don't know if it's good i i i don't want to say it's getting worse his number is like it was going down and now it's going back up so i guess technically it's getting worse you want a low number but he's also getting older so the number going up isn't like horrible because it's not like in the high 20s or anything and we have so many of you reaching out saying hey have you tried this hey is it this hey be tested for this and essentially any common reason that a baby has hyperbili is ruled out um all the common reasons they tested for everything our blood compatibility is is great we're compatible with each other his liver is working fine his liver is great um his blood for the most part looks good yeah um recently they think and this is the only it's not my breast milk it's not your breast milk this is the only thing that they can kind of put a finger on is that maybe he has anemia um because his red blood levels are a little low and his what is it it's called um well his hemoglobin levels are really low which could result in needing a blood i'm not transferring either it's a blood transfusion or an exchange transfusion it's one of those and i know they're two totally different things but this is all just new information and we have so much information going into our brains every single day i cannot keep so much and obviously we're listening to everything that you guys are telling us so many things that family friends at anything because we're just looking for an answer now like all the things that usually babies are in here for jaundice for none of them are like why he's here it's now we're getting into the more really rare things that like the doctors are even one it's like one percent of it's like one in a hundred thousand that's how they explain like this is like one in a hundred thousand jaundice cases is like this where this could be the reason but it's extremely rare and that's kind of where we're at so now we're testing for things that take three to four days to find out we're reaching out to other doctors tested for g6pd right now we did a genetic test like genome sequencing sequencing so much stuff i'm sure you guys listening you're like you're like what that doesn't make any sense because it doesn't even mean we have no idea we don't even know what it is it's still like and i'm like researching every day but it's still all just like so much information so that's where we're at guys so much going on all in all he's eating pretty good he's gr he's gaining weight still so like the most important things he's hydrated um but we have no idea when we can bring it home it could it could literally be a month two months we have no idea it could literally be in two days i know it's all just like it just depends on when he decides when his body just decides to get rid of it at this point we just we're just trusting god that for whatever reason this didn't catch god by surprise and he's allowing this to happen again for a reason that we have no idea and we wish it wasn't happening and it sucks so bad but he is god and we're not and we trust that and that if we're praying for a miracle 20 times a day and if god wants him to wake up tomorrow with a super low billy number and us to go home then if that's in his will then it'll happen but if not we pray that we're okay with whatever path he leads us down even though we would really like to go home so god would really like to go home the second we get out of here whenever that is like you don't realize how sad it is until you walk down the same lobby to go to the bathroom all day long until you see the same exact nurses like i'm so bored and you're staring and you're staring at this tiny room with a baby right across from you in an incubator all day long yeah that you can't hold and you can't take home and then i oh and then i have all this guilt of like okay but i have other kids and i need to go take care of them so like then i need to go then i switch with coal and then i'll go like spend time with the girls but then the whole time i'm with the girls i just have so much anxiety that i'm not with my baby like it's so weird i like don't even know how to explain it it's like so overwhelming the whole call ride home to the girls i cry and then the whole car ride back from the girls i cry because i feel bad that i'm leaving the girls to go to him like like i just like all my my emotions are just like all over the place all in all this is probably the hardest this is not probably this is definitely the hardest thing that we have ever had to go through and then second was being 10 centimeters dilated but i would do that i needed to take him back home there's just so many mountains and valleys and there's not really mountains but so many moments like this yeah we're like i'll be good and then all of a sudden i just i just think about it and i'll be home alone and she won't be in bed with me and i'll think that my baby's not here and i'll start crying and it's just but we're gonna end this here um honestly guys just pray for us pray for my wife pray for our baby we pray for healing in jesus name we are declaring life we're declaring that we can go home um we pray for a breakthrough and we pray that you guys pray with us so thank you guys for your support and we'll catch you all next vlog hopefully going home we're leaving are you so excited we're getting out of here look he has this going home outfit on he's even got his going home hat on it's party hat oh it's a good day it's a good day we're going home       so i'm filming my phone because we got good news i didn't even bring the camera because we weren't even expecting it i guess we weren't expecting it it's just unexpected so they took the big light off right here again i'm vlogging on my phones i'm sorry little boy still in there but they had a big light right here the mac daddy okay so the next morning um last night i was vlogging on my phone you all saw we were extremely happy because it was essentially the lowest his number has kind of gotten with us a little therapy it was a 14.4 which is still pretty good jaundice but better than what it's been um this morning we were hoping that it dropped even more because it would show that he's kind of declining he went from 14.4 up to 15.1 so we were hoping that it would keep going down we were hoping they would keep going down it's not terrible news because um it didn't spike but it didn't keep going down nonetheless um that was that was with his jaundice blanket which you can see under him lighting up and the jaundice light um because it didn't even go up a whole point they're taking another light off just to see what his body would do on its own not on its own he still has a blanket but with no headlights so they took away this one they've already taken away the big one so now this is his first time only on the blanket honestly pretty much since we've been here yeah it's never just been about no pretty much since we've been here he which has been almost 90 days now it's a step in the right direction it's been never taken before yeah so we're hopeful we're confident we woke up and we had the news and we were a little bummed because we were hoping for like a 13 or 12 or you know we're just really waiting for god just to like take it away all at once but we're trusting this process we're trusting what's happening our little guy's eating he's growing he's awake right now and we're so thankful because because there's no light above he doesn't have to wear his goggles if he doesn't want to so he's got to be in here but at least he can look at us and we can look at him and he's very happy with the goggles so tonight will be a really big deal like tonight's the biggest deal yeah tonight's the biggest deal tomorrow's like the next biggest deal every every new test is the next biggest tonight we'll know if he like jumps a lot with just the blanket or if he just kind of stays in the 15 range which would be awesome because that would mean they would take the blanket away to see what he would do next yeah if he can stay below 16 tonight that'd be awesome if you can even drop with no blink or just a blanket then you would be oh my gosh he's the best baby i'd be so happy but you are so easy the doctors keep saying that usually babies who are in here as long as him scream the whole time so you get no swaddle you're stuck in here we can't hold you that much oh okay but he does it for like half a second and he's like okay but we're praying we're believing we're trusting he's gonna be okay day ten uh yesterday was a really good day we're being quiet because he's sleeping and it's just kind of quiet time here in the hospital but yesterday was a really good day um they ended up taking all of his lights off for the first time since we've been here because his number dropped to a 14.8 with only one line left him overnight and his numbers shot up from a 14.8 to a 16.8 um which isn't good it went up two points overnight so he's back on the light we were really excited because we thought we might be going home soon this doesn't necessarily mean that we aren't going home soon but it just put us back a few days or more because it means that essentially he's not better and we don't know why so they're actually having the chief hematologist right hematologist come by and talk to us in like an hour like the chief hematologist like all of orange county like the smartest person to come and explain to us what she thinks might be causing this because none of the doctors know and that's where we're at how are you i'm okay we're tired my family came in from florida a few days ago because they had these flights for a while to see the baby and it's sad and unfortunate because they likely won't be able to see the baby which is honestly it's okay we just want the baby safe and healthy but at least uh evan posey have some grandparent time and family time in the midst of all this so that's one pro but um we've been going back and forth back and forth back and forth so i can assure you that we're not just leaving the kids at the house with babysitters with family and just whenever we vlog we happen to pick the camera up here but i'll try to film a little bit of the house through the week so you guys can see the girls and they're doing all right they you're a lot happier once you're outside of this room yeah i feel like i picked the camera up in this room more often to update you guys and this room is just so it's just so depressing there's no other way to put it we've kind of explained that in the previous videos so if we always seem sad this is a very sad time but i promise you that there's little joys in between whenever we find out good news and whenever back home with our healthy kids or even in moments where we're holding him he's eating good um it's just really hard so y'all just keep us in your prayers and we'll keep updating you guys and right now we just don't know what's what's going to happen day 10.   all right we got some good news it is day 12 12. day 12. still nicu they're taking them off likes again so the experience for the nicu has been good news ben who's good news bad news we're mostly bad news bad news so every time we get good news we don't necessarily even vlog it because we think bad news is exactly yeah and this is on my phone so we didn't even come like preparing to film anything but we got good news he's hello and the doctors and nurses want to take him off the lights completely again this happened in the past we shot back up but we're feeling we're feeling different this time yeah and he's looking different he's looking really awake he's alert i mean because the lights kind of dehydrate him and make him sleepy i feel like so but because it's up and down he has to be steady for 48 hours it's wednesday at 11 a.m so if he's steady we can go home friday before noon which would be a full two weeks in acute but we thought we were gonna be here much longer and we could be he could chew back up we know though but it's a good moment right now that two weeks in the nicu is long enough and this is my first skin on skin with him since he's been born since he was hours old so this is very special because whenever he's in that bed with the lights on we don't want to do this hey can you show everybody can you show anybody your cute little hat look at your little hat see almost dead almost did they even say that we can put him in an outfit like he hasn't had an outfit on since we've been here zealand we could put in a little outfit he was smiling earlier oh don't you smile yeah guys guys we need to put in like a real outfit so we're gonna put it in the roll off it but before we did that one though um and it's so sad because my family flew over florida to see them but they leave tomorrow likely we might exceed their flights might not but they're going to be tomorrow the heel is possibly on friday the next day but it's okay as long as you get a healthy baby that's all that we care about ourselves oh jesus please help his numbers below tonight so he can stay and not have to go back on lights oh i really impose you want to see you so bad i'm assuming that you guys already know this but because of coco and just nick here in general everybody imposing haven't seen him since we've been here so they haven't seen him in about two weeks so if and when we can bring up home it's pretty much like we're bringing him home for the first time he's probably going to be bigger definitely looks so cute to me right now oh my gosh he looks a little like a fake baby doll so i'm getting ready to walk into the hospital swap out with savannah savannah's definitely stayed so many more nights than me out the hospital but i think tonight could be the last night at the nicu tomorrow marks two full weeks so i want savannah to get home get some good sleep because if she comes back with this baby one she hasn't been sleeping too good at the nicu um the not most comfortable couch and two um if we can bring our baby home then she's gonna be super busy up through a lot of the nights breastfeeding all that um so i'm gonna go and exchange with savannah and hopefully this is our last night here this is the the first time i've been excited walking into the hospital because i think it might be my last time walking into the hospital so fingers crossed praying hard believing big that we're bringing our baby z home in the morning the test will tell also we're taking a big test in the morning and we'll see what his his numbers are this could be our last night here if you got good numbers in the morning i believe in you you have so many people praying for you buddy you can do this we do look pretty yellow but they said that's okay   so it's the morning and we got our test results and they weren't the best but they're good enough to go home so we're going home today and savannah doesn't know yet savannah's going to be here any minute he's hungry and we just found out so i get to tell her that we're going we're home excited okay his numbers aren't the best we gotta do a lot of follow appointments and we still don't know what's wrong with this guy but we get to take him home so that's that's major improvements mama's gonna be so excited we're leaving are you so excited we're getting out of here look he has this going home outfit on he's even got his going home hat on it's party hat oh it's a good day it's a good day um we'll explain a lot more after we get home and show the girls him and everything but just kind of what's going on we've already scheduled um appointments to make because still honestly i have no idea what's causing this and something is causing it um it's still happening it's still happening his levels are still high but not high enough to where he needs even the nicu and because he's two weeks older his body's more

just going to be fun i'm so excited hi so kyle's swaddling him in oliver's blanket so you guys are going to want to watch their videos as well because this is accent it's the exact same thing so it's

oakley and halston um just to see if they even notice i i don't even think that they're gonna notice i think i don't know we'll see but so you guys have to go to the fish fam channel after you guys watch this video and go watch tatum and oakley's reaction with zealand being oliver um so that's what they're filming right now and then i'll take zeeland back home with me and madison is going to come over to our house later to switch um just to switch with oliver and zealand to prank ev mainly i mean we'll see what posey does but i think it's going to be really funny seeing everybody's reaction so i'm just going to take in these baby snowballs right now and put the camera away because i love this little boy i walked in and they go they go i don't like that baby he's weird so i get

yellow oh baby that is so cute you guys both had babies pretty much the same time and stuff are they a week apart here exactly one week i can tell he's heavier yeah oliver was like at his last point it was six and a half pounds oh so he would drop two um he's already eight and a half oh my goodness they're gonna colors are so different i know he's like super ready he's like i'm thinking i'm gonna put him in one of his outfits yeah because i think everybody everybody will know do you think she's gonna know or do you think she's gonna like know right away she's gonna know right away i know okay so me and mama got a date night planned tonight we got one of those picnic collectives and here's the girls with a turtle everybody just got back from dance class   and he's a turtle you guys are wondering our turtles are perfectly fine bow turtles they're good don't go see baby z come on come on hasn't seen him like a whole day so everybody actually just switched to a new dance studio she did so i'm pretty excited about that because she's made some new friends it's a lot of fun yeah you like it what was your favorite class today i don't know it's probably jazz or ballet really badly like that right wow it's a boy teacher and he makes um he calls me um every day he calls instead of not really yeah he calls everybody nicknames that's because it's so funny she what's so funny oh you're the worst of pranks you should like get it going wait what's wrong what's wrong i know who this baby is how do you know oliver how do you know this is all over here that's steven what are you talking about oliver z does not grow this fast i got you oh we're smaller than zebra no just his head oh pranked um the twins with zelen earlier and they they saw me like walking in with oliver towards the end of it and they go mom i found the real oliver and then they kept saying oh this baby's weird this is not our baby this is a weird baby is funny so guys you want to predicament because posey can actually climb into the turtle habitation thing and she's always trying to get him and throw wood in his water bowl so i don't know how we stop this we just kind of usually don't let her in there but she really likes it in here and she's really obsessed with the turtle recently so kind of difficult right posey can you say oh yeah yeah and then just like that guys that easy tatum goes oliver looks like posey and we were all confused and me and savannah are actually on a picnic date night tonight so this is a team called the picnic collective no promo but we love using them and so much fun great

of big news something that we want to start doing something that we talked about a lot in the nicu and i feel like it's kind of perfect timing to start doing this on my birthday um a time to give back um so i think of how we even get into this so we don't really have a plan we don't have a plan yet but we we know that we want to do something yeah we know we want to do something with just giving back to families that either are in the nicu have a sick baby have a sick kid have lots of hospital bills from from sick kids um like something along that lines even like people that have lost a kid or lost a baby just financially helping and like even just talking talking to them and like being someone that they can talk to i mean and raising awareness of certain things not saying like we have experience and all that at all because we don't but just someone just have someone to talk to yeah and just raising awareness and just like giving having it be to where we can like show you guys this family and then like we all can like go support them so it's like so much support that there's like we know that we have this big following and we don't want it to seem like we're doing this for a video or or whatever um but this i feel like we're almost like we're all better together like all of us together we can like help this family just like we can like show their gofundme and like you guys can even give to them if you want also or like we can show their instagram handle and all of you guys can go over and just like pray for them and just give them good yeah just be there for them just be there for them and like we noticed through this that like with our situation with zealand like we're still waiting for answers and like we're still like going in like getting tests done and and he might not have anything he quite likely has something up but having the large audience and following with so many people out there who have similar situations helped us ask questions to the doctors help us bring attention to them and that there's so many stories out there there's so many families out there who are in similar situations where it's like we don't know what's going on but if we can broadcast and highlight their their their story not not in a way to try and um glamorize it but in a way that like listen this this is what this family's struggling with there's so many families out there who are trying to raise awareness for a very rare disease a very new thing something where they feel like they're all alone and maybe if there's one two five twenty of you guys watching who are like no way my so-and-so has that my so-and-so has this and they can connect and they can rally off each other and just um it's just such a hard time i mean being in the nicu was and we were only there for two weeks but that was the hardest time ever for us so we just know that we need to do something and again we don't know where this is going to take us but what we want to start doing now just because we don't want to wait until we have it all figured out just because we're like we want to do something now um is we have a family mind who are about to call up we're going to show their story because they have been trying to raise awareness for their son for a long time i've been in contact with their family for several years now um and and they've helped us we've helped them um just back and forth they're just an amazing family who we've been in contact with but they've been trying to raise awareness for the sun i posted instagram stories here and there but we really just want to highlight their family um on here so we're going to show you guys a clip of just their their their battle that they've been going through with their son um it's not easy to watch this isn't gonna be something that's light-hearted and super easy to watch but it's just super real so um if you want to fast forward because it's just too hard to watch we get that but i do encourage you guys to watch it because this is what this family goes through every single day and it breaks our heart so um and then we're gonna facetime them we're gonna call them up and see how we can help   he was admitted into intensive care moments after birth weight only two pounds and 15 ounces after spending two months in the nicu he had began suffering with unexplained seizures digestive issues and cataracts   it's conditioned puzzle doctors and every test fail to offer answers   we're happy that we know what it is now   baby good morning   say good morning everybody huh there you go good boy good boy hey what's up man hey what's up guys hello you guys doing all right awesome we're doing good we're doing good thanks for taking the time to talk with   yeah hey well he's always in our prayers and um we wanted to ask you guys if it was okay um we wanted to share your guys story on some of our upcoming youtube videos and um link your guys gofundme to see if we could help raise money on top of awareness obviously for your family and your son's condition as i know you guys are already trying to do um we wanted to see if you guys are okay and comfortable with that first and foremost um obviously that's that's something that that you know you guys don't have to make a decision on now but that we want you guys to you know to be comfortable with no we appreciate it man that's really what we've always been trying to push is just trying to get somebody to to notice him and to you know maybe someone you guys kind of maybe felt a little bit of it you know what i'm saying like trying to find someone to give you some kind of answer and um with him it's just the same thing we just know what it is but there's nothing to do   yeah what would you what would you guys say that the hardest part is obviously aside from seeing your son in pain and distress what would you guys say that i got like the number one thing that people could help you with would be if people could help you what would be the number one way that people could help you and don't be shy you can say literally anything look um me and my wife have to leave our careers in order to be here with both of the kids because you know my oldest has autism so just him with him just we have to be next to him all the time all the time like he'll be sleeping we try to like fall asleep while he's asleep and then he's like he has vomit coming out his nose out of his mouth and it's like so he just can't you know not not leave him and now school starting you know how with the covet and everything noah has school so i have to sit with him so we change schedules in order for us to try to function and you know so i i go to sleep at 4 00 p.m i wake up at one in the morning she takes over um and then like you know i'm saying like that's how that's how we do it from one to one basically and just that you um i guess though what i'm trying to say is the financial um instability you know what i'm saying like not knowing what's gonna happen next because we're like yeah you know she was a bank teller for a long time for almost 14 years i was a caregiver i used to take care of elderly people and so that's just gone now um we've tried different things you know to try to make it out there but um i think it's just that the worry of what's gonna happen next how are you supposed to continue to care for both of them um yeah no absolutely well obviously we hope that getting your story out there will raise awareness we'll raise um hopefully some some funds to help provide for just your family and and it's hard time i mean i can't even imagine just having the situation that you're in on top of like you said and in covet and lockdowns and already crazy times um so so we hope that you know some of our followers can can go and donate but on top of that we want to um give you guys ten thousand dollars today just to help with help with stuff right now just obviously we don't know if and when you know people might give their own but we want to give you guys ten thousand dollars just to help out right now because uh we went through a little bit of it but we couldn't imagine i mean you guys have been doing this since today he was born we won't do it for two weeks and he's doing better praise god and we really do pray for your son and your family all the time but like you said you just don't know when and i could not imagine being in your guy's shoes and i know that we message all the time just talking about how strong you guys are um but you guys are fighters and we look up to you all so much thank you thank you so much man we're just talking about what we're gonna do today um   like what can we do next um thank you guys man i don't know what else to say other than just thank you yeah hey hey hey we are we aren't doing this for you guys to give us some some crazy drawn out reaction we love you guys and we just want to help and um and obviously if you guys are comfortable with us sharing your story as i know you've already been trying to do for a long time then we honestly all that we want to do is help um whenever we're in that in that two-week period we felt so lost and that's why i even reached out to you a lot because i knew that you had been in this and i believe that you guys can help so many people that this isn't happening without reason and we believe in you guys and god chose this battle for you guys and and y'all are gonna come out so much stronger as i know you guys already have from so much of it thank you thank you that just breaks our hearts it breaks our hearts it's if you guys watch it it's incredibly hard to watch um like he said multiple times you guys should go follow them on instagram support them in whatever way you can he said this multiple times that if it's that hard for you to watch imagine how hard it is for them as parents to watch and deal with every single day with their own baby so we don't want to sugarcoat it that's just the reality of what it is so if you guys we want to ask you right now if you guys can go click the link in our description box down below donut to their family they had to stop work to care for their kids in times like this would go good both of them don't work and they have to switch off sleepings because nobody could ever sleep with him so it's just so sad it's so sad it's so sad so i can't imagine we're praying for them we're lifting them up but if you guys can help financially you guys just don't even understand if even if it's just a dollar if anything that you can do i know that some of you can't and that's okay that's okay we don't want to guilt trippy if you can't give we get it but if you can please do we'll link it at the very top or description box click it donate anything helps you guys can also help us by emailing us like families that you guys know of that we can reach out to just just famous who really need help for future families who really need help just like how we talk about early we don't know where this is going to go where it's going to take us but we just want to help people who have kids who are sick and just need help a lot of you guys have been asking for an update on him so we want to update you guys but um i took him to get his blood or his bilirubin levels checked and we just got it back that he's 6.8 so if you guys have been following and like know what's been going on with him he had drawn us really bad he was in the nicu for 14 days because of it and it was just like such a weird case of just like he just kept going up up up and like he'd go down and then go back up again with lights on like it's just it was a really rare case that we still don't really have answers on um he got whenever he took him he was at a 19.8 yeah and if you get into like that 23 territory they say that it can start causing brain damage so they got to put him on light but the difference of his was like usually they can get babies levels down really fast just with photo therapy lights and for him he would keep going up with the lights and then he'd go down even with the strong board yeah he had the strongest all over the place for 14 days and then when we left he was still even 15 which is still really high it's not like in the critical range but it was still really high but safe enough to where we can go home and deal with it at the house um and we just had to keep getting checked up but so now he is at a 6.8 which is huge and because it's huge because the lowest that it ever got in the hospital with triple therapy it was a 12.7 and then it started going up with triple threat again so it's never been this low it's just really good we're so happy right now but um you know at the same time we all i i honestly talk about this i feel guilty i know it isn't weird like i i feel guilty that like he he's doing better and i know that there's kids like nathan and famous like that who they don't know if and when their kids get to get better so that's why we're doing this because we don't want to forget what we went through and last thing too because a lot of you guys are asking was we never we still don't have his test results back but when we do like just for the genetic testing and just to figure out what else is going on with him we will let you guys know but they said that it could take six to eight weeks so it could just come whenever it could come tomorrow i could come in six eight weeks so that's it um and what you guys are about to see is his first photo shoot this was actually done what um a night ago yeah this is done last night i think i'm like losing track of time but this was done like like last night um so we aren't going into this now but we did this last night so hope you guys wanted to show you guys how cute it is because it's pretty cute so now you'll have a little smile on your face you see your mama all right you guys see your mama babies first photo shoot you gotta get those stretches out yeah are we gonna get those stretches out let's see if he likes the really tight swaddle i know remember i think posey hated it remember yeah and he's already kicking he's already

weeks ago something like that a month issue and they uh this has been a big project we started talking with them back in march honestly before all the shutdowns and everything but all that happened so then um last month we kind of talked to them about doing our movie room and the baby's nursery so we wanted to have the babies nurseries done a while ago but luckily luckily we got it done right before right before i i mean it was done what a week before he came because he came so early yeah so we're going to show you guys the baby's nursery in just a second if you haven't seen it on mr kate's channel yet um but before we show you guys that we're going to show you guys the movie room that mr kate did as well we're going to show you guys before on each because the befores on each were pretty much nothing um i'm gonna show you guys it before right now in the movie room we literally had nothing in there just some some nice chairs we had some nice chairs and a big tv but that was it um the before and after is insane after you watch this video go watch their videos on the movie room in the nursing room because they're so cool they're like really long detailed videos of like start till finish and it's like the process is just so cool it's literally like a tv show like like we're just showing you guys before and after but like on theirs it shows like the entire process and it is just insane and so awesome like such high quality production stuff and they were so safe while they were here they you know following coveted protocol they're like so awesome keeping everything safe and sanitary with us and with them so it was awesome they're the best the rooms look so good so good so be sure to go and subscribe we're gonna link mr kate down below be sure to go and subscribe to them because they deserve all the subscribers on youtube they're the best um okay here comes the movie room we're excited to be here yeah show us your space all right movie room you say okay nice movie theater trailers it doesn't feel like a movie theater like you almost want to be able to leave your house when you come in here right like layered right built a tier yeah stadium seating honestly without your guys help i don't know if we would have ever done this because like we would have been like content enough and gotten so used to just like we got chairs and a tv and you have crushed ice is that what that is yeah like you were saying like carpeting so yeah yeah for like acoustics even like movie posters on the wall like make it really yeah you know it'd be cool to make like movie posters with you guys is like this okay so movie theater awesome and here's the after got a little ticket booth right outside the door open it up oh my gosh holy guacamole yeah this is insane     everly rose the dancing detectives they literally made these posie in her pony these movie theater posters i'm pregnant aloha this is right before z came so we got a little z baby in there but i mean they literally made a step up here which is insane so look at this put in new lights on the walls like movie theater lights as well as over here click that switch lights that go under the steps what the heck i had like a level like that before so they did the level and everything so like the back row you know isn't blocked by the front so you can actually see so awesome i mean red walls so many details that honestly i can't even tell you about you just got to go to their thing to tell you the tell you about it popcorn it's a little stale by this point because yeah this is like it's like a month old like we said the candy used to be so much more food if you watched the original video on their channel they came to a stack to the top that understood how much we've been in here we've we've literally been in here every day it's just a tv it's just our same tv but it looks like a movie theater tv so awesome so awesome we love it i bet you guys are ready to see the nursery okay so now we're outside baby z's nursery and you guys fun fact we filmed this nursery tour video and it was going to go up on the day that our labor vlog went up because i went into labor that night that we filmed this remember we filmed the nursery review at like seven o'clock at night or something i went into labor like 8 30. yeah she started going later at 8 30 so we were gonna show you we planned on showing you guys this like a month ago yeah ish something like that um but he came so postponed but you guys are gonna see it now um this room was literally just an extra room that we had that was kind of like a guest room completely blank there was nothing in it besides air mattress bed that's it there's an air mattress so if my family came just an extra room but so they did everything i'll show you guys before literally nothing so right now the nursery is basically just nothing it has an air mattress white walls nothing going on it's a tall room but otherwise it is small it's a small little postage stamp room it's actually the perfect size for a nursery nothing it's great yeah we've got the necessary nursery items coming in here i'm so glad we're getting rid of that we have a new beautiful fixture going in to the bathroom it's obviously the bathroom is so much part of this room the nursery also has its own bathroom um in it but it's just pretty plain yeah when we came and scouted we were like okay this nursery has an ensuite bathroom which basically just means no other rooms access this bathroom so it really is part of the space part of the design so yeah we couldn't leave that room just plain and white as is i have a new picture going in on the ceiling there they didn't even have on there like we're gonna have blackout burns for them overhead new vanity bulbs and also i have a floor lamp too and then what else we're doing here we're doing so we're doing like a molding situation   my favorite this room   oh my goodness how cute   so awesome confusing how do you do this it's so awesome look at the wallpaper look like i don't really have too many words to say other than like men this room's awesome i love it because i feel like it's not too baby-ish you know and i feel like this is a room that he can grow up in like whether he's like a newborn or three or eight or whatever like he can stay in this room up until he's like even a teenager it's like a really cool room as far as just like the design crib yeah i didn't think about that but i mean so many little details they added a little soccer details that i love she hand painted these are hand drew and their little soccer jerseys on all the other girls so cute so i guess he probably has to play soccer we're gonna let him do whatever he wants but you know if you're a baby and you're kinda like seeing soccer maybe will want to whatever yeah and i love this changing table because when i'm when you're not in diapers anymore you just take it off and then it's a dresser what wow i got a fishing net so it's kind of like boat themed as you see if you go into the bathroom they didn't just do the bedroom they did the bathroom as well which is so cool it's literally like a boat themed   bathroom   they made this whole window like a porthole boat window yeah so cool yeah there was nothing around there she handed her that the walls should laugh i learned that from her this is really neat added in the light painted the doors well so many little details and accessories and it just looks like entirely different it was just a white normal room and now you got the coolest nursery ever they just look so good on both the rooms both rooms you walk in you're like like because before they were just not anything at all it really makes the rest of the rooms in our house look a little we're almost like can you come back and do a couple others can we collab with the rest of the rooms around the master bedroom everything pushy because now you walk into z in the nursery room the kitchen into the room um

i'm this is a very asked question as well how did you guys come up with zeal's thing yeah um you keep up with it yeah   hello guys welcome back to the channel um as you guys can see we're posting on monday because we didn't post on saturday um there's just been a lot going on not not like bad stuff but life's just a lot more crazy with three kids and uh we might have to skip a day here and there or even like in the potential talks of like we love and we've always just like i've always just held this small little camera and blocked myself but now that we have two little babies and like they're kind of hard it's hard to vlog with them it's hard because they're just like i got my hands full or trying to film so i don't know we're figuring this out but we obviously will keep being constant but sitting down and doing a q a is kind of the easiest video to make so that's what we're doing right now we haven't done one of these in forever so we thought so much has been going on so this is kind of perfect timing it's late the kids are asleep they're sleeping it might be kind of echoey we might not talk too too loud because we don't wake them up but um loud enough forget to hear so we're gonna get right into it all right so savannah asked you guys on instagram any question that you guys want to ask here we go let's get into it i went through and i picked them out so she has no idea what they are we haven't done these in a long time yeah it's always fun for us so some will be short some will be long but stay tuned for it all because i don't have to talk about yeah okay here we go ready first question how long have you cole been together we've been together for like a long time four years we've been together for like a long time four years four years we've been married for three yeah together before yes um does posey ever get jealous of zealand no that no we've seen something yeah i just screenshotted that because honestly a lot of people ask that question yeah no posey's been really really great with him this is probably the most asked question how many kids do you plan on having this is just like always asked like when you when you guys gonna have your next kid how many kids oh you answered wow that's very generous of you are you guys thinking about baby number four no no i've never been so on page about that before nope we're very content with where we're at now and we do want another kid or two but um or two not now so if you guys i think that we also like we're not very sure like we'd love to like have like a two year age gap between those next two but also who the heck knows with us i can promise you this if you see us post a video saying we're pregnant or something like that in then next year it was an accident but we're super excited about super stoked but it was an accident we're not trying for a probably one at least maybe for two years at least yes are y'all wanting to adopt yes and that's yes or something along those lines yeah and again it it probably isn't now um and probably isn't in the next few years probably won't be like in our youtube time frame yeah but um who knows you know it's one of those things like i don't want to say no because god could bring a kid who needs a home into our life and i shouldn't that's that oliver is way cuter than zealand   that was a question that was nice we're so young i mean i just turned 24 so like there's so many things even like 20 years like we're like in our 40s like who's to say that we want to like adopt a kid when we're like in our 40s or 50s and we have this nice home and an extra room and so like there's so much that goes into it but shorts long story short between us having kids i probably i probably won't have one more see so he probably wants to have one more and i'd probably so we'll probably have three more this was a very ask question do you guys plan on getting a dog again soon so we were thinking about this for a second but i don't think we're going to yeah especially not right now we're actually really looking into it like like in the middle of quarantine we're kind of bored life was easy you were pregnant no no but now we had the newborn all the stuff with the nicu and just like life just got crazy yeah um no not right now do you guys think that you would ever move again um i saw i i i saw this question a bit like are you guys planning on staying in california for everything you guys think you would ever be we honestly talk about it a lot more than we probably should we we talk about about the possibility of florida yeah more so just cause all my families in florida um we either talk about the idea of trying to get my family out here to california or the idea of us what it would look like for us to get in florida so that it's very up in the air but we do talk about it yeah so it's not like we're like in california forever you know we just kind of trust we're going wants we like we're very like spontaneous and we kind of get bored a lot so i could see us just like randomly one month being like let's go get let's go here this is a very ask question as well how did you guys come up with zeon's name oh yeah um yeah i actually ran into a little boy at church and his name was zealand z-e-a-l-a-n but i thought he said zealand at the time so i was like that's so cool i love it like i've never heard it before i went and told him and right away he was like that's it like we both just loved it right yeah yeah and then and then i found out later that his name was really zealand but i just kept cause we didn't we have like a ton of girl names like on deck mainly you but like we don't have like any we never had a boy name we never had one no we never so like whatever it was like she said zealand i was like oh man that's so cool right when i right when i noticed i liked it and i told him and he noticed like right away that he liked it i think we were just like super excited and like with posey we had like names before posey and like some names that kind of came up like in between and stuff with zealand it was just zealand always zealand never thought anything of it so when people send you rude dms or rude words anywhere what do you do about it ignore it yeah what do you do about it i don't care i block them yeah i block them as simple as that yeah they're me too but i also just don't care there's a lot of mean people and i know i don't know if that makes sense so bad she does really good job but like as a girl one of the girls tend to here's the thing i'm gonna say one thing and if you have anyone talking about about you personally also just know that anyone that's talking bad about you doesn't like where they're at in their life so they're reflecting what they don't like about their life on to you yeah do you have date nights and how often yeah we we actually do this a lot we just we need to we love date nights um i mean i'll say once a week yeah you know i mean it's like i mean obviously we did it for a whole month straight yeah with like him and the nicu and just something there's time frames where we just like don't and we don't have like a set date night it's like every friday or every it's just like once it's like oh it's been actually on average when things are just going smooth and normal once we always have a day night yeah and that doesn't include like sitting down watching netflix like once the kids are in bed like we're talking about natural get out of the house go on a date go to dinner why do you guys turn off your youtube channel's comment section i read that really poorly but we don't youtube just turns off random families comment sections so so why is this all we can't turn them on even if we wanted to but what is baby z's status so i got this question a lot too we do have him on some baby dating websites okay he's doing a lot better a lot better a lot better yeah i don't even think he has any jobs anymore i mean we haven't gotten tested in like two weeks now a week a week it's been like a week um i've always shot it down i know i haven't ready but but last week a week ago he was only in sixes which is awesome because when we took him into the hospital he was 19.8 which is really high so he was six last week i'm i i feel like he's like three or two now yeah because he he looks so good like his color and i saw like about like asking like did we ever find out what was causing the high bilirubin what his diagnosis was everything they ran every test imaginable everything came back he's normal we're still waiting on his genetic testing results but once we find out we'll let you guys yeah so we don't know yet david francis how long did it take about five weeks how long did what take or was it six months i bet i'll say that and then time frame between five weeks and six months okay that makes no sense what's some advice for being a single mom due in january oh just give one one piece of ice one piece of advice doesn't have to be too too much just take care of yourself too that's true i feel like that's probably something i did take not do myself i just like was like so which is good like i feel like i was a good mom but i think that you also need to like take time for yourself too how do you handle postpartum stuff and this was like a very broad question just i think you talked about it a lot in the nicu about how you were very emotional and a lot of what was doing i thought you were so wrong with me you would like just like turn the corner to look at me and be like were you crying today and i would like start bawling my eyes out because i don't cry and then like 25 times after brazil and emily but this wasn't there so that's why i said since i met you i don't even know because i didn't have it with everly and i didn't have a phobia like i don't think i did did you notice anything no not with both but with zeeland i noticed i did honestly i noticed that i did in the hospital the night after i had him and i didn't think he knew this but i was crying for like 30 minutes straight and he was just sleep asleep on the couch and i remember thinking like while it was healthy like before we got the nicu yeah and i remember thinking like why the heck am i crying and i was like thinking of excuses like i called the nurse and i'm like my back hurts you're trying to find yourself yeah i'm trying to find reasons for like why i was crying like i couldn't find anything like i had a perfectly healthy baby next to me my husband was like so helpful and sweet he was just finally getting 20 minutes of sleep and i just sat there crying and so it's all funny because i know a lot of people struggle with this for longer than i did but i think the nicu also just like made it so escalated so i was just like so bad for like two weeks straight and then probably what five days after we got home i was okay but you're still kind of emotional for a while i think just from like the roller coaster but yeah but i would just not stop cry over everything like someone would bring something up and i would just like be in tears yeah so i don't know that was really hard i don't i don't know how to tell anybody how to deal with it because i i don't even know how to deal with it but i think sleep helped a lot when she when she was able to get sleepy like like how she said earlier taking care of your water yeah the very simple things like he was really good about reminding me like you need to eat you need to sleep like especially in the nicu like go home and he like he would sleep there every now and then and let me go home and just get some sleep even though i just cried the whole time the whole drive home the whole way up my stairs the whole way before bed i just cried but it was like so good for me just to get sleep yeah but also have help like if you can if you're have family have them come help you especially if you're dealing with postpartum because that could be really hard being by yourself i feel like yeah that's that's something i wasn't in the house yeah it's like and i obviously wasn't pregnant didn't have postpartum but like i would say like if you can and you're in a situation to have somebody close you know preferably you know your spouse or partner um but even like a really close friend or family member who's like in your life who can like almost take care of you as you're taking care of like your baby or the situation like have someone who's like looking out for you and being like hey you need to sleep and listen to them or hey you need to eat and listen to them or hey you need this because sometimes i think you don't realize what you need are you going to get back in the groove with posting fun challenging type videos probably eventually kind of explain how it's tough filming right now so we're kind of figuring it all out yeah um families first so we're trying to keep up with the videos and the fun stuff but um we're working through it but yeah we're gonna get back into fun videos congratulations for everything that is going on in your life thank you what advice would you give us about marriage one piece marriage one piece keep it like 20 seconds or so um find out their love language and even if you don't want to do it do it wow as much as you can wow that's good as you can marriage is like a marathon kind of thing it's the long run and it's a lot different than dating or even engagement or anything else so like any frustrations or anger or resentment that you can hold against your spouse just think like is this gonna be a big deal in 10 years you know if it's like one of those things like oh the trash or oh i can't believe they said this or uh like you gotta let those things go you just gotta let it go yeah you know obviously if it's like cheating or something huge like oh this is a big deal in 10 years then like you know just communications i'm talking through those things how do you have a baby you push really hard right yeah push your head up okay okay why is cole ugly so honestly this is the most asked question um are you ugly my nose is big i just have a big nose my ears poke out a lot more than i should i'm i'm not i'm not overweight but i can easily have many chances yeah um i think i have a lazy eye on my eye do you like to poop do you ever swear no only when i get really angry how old is carol where is carol i know this isn't funny guys but there's somebody two different people asked about i was asking about carol we don't know where i don't even know if it's funny it's funny just because

it was amazing and we love it nothing bad to say about it but it was far from our house so it was like 40 minute drive so we just can't do that with two babies yeah oh you guys sing more oh don't take

see what you look like with the bunnies oh let me see who is let me see oh no they fall off oh he's so cute oh it's like a hug thank you and now to get our mind off the scary halloween place we came to a park where there's sand one of our favorite things to do is just play in the sand   one two three   okay a little update it is labor day weekend it's sunday um and this past weekend it has been 108 two days in a row biggest heat wave ever and on top of that savannah woke up with mastitis so if you guys followed posey's pregnancy journey with savannah savannah got mastitis savannah got mastitis with posey essentially it's um a breast milk infection but it's not just like an infection actually yeah you have like a 102 fever right now and she's been sleeping a lot of the day just because she's not feeling good so um sustains usually my site just doesn't last too long so she kind of woke up with it this morning so we're hoping that it's gone either tomorrow or the next day but we'll see we'll see she's not first day yeah first day but last time i think she had like a 104 fever she's like right below 102 right now so it's high but it could be a lot worse we're kind of going a little crazy because we're stuck in the house it's so hot poor savannah's sick baby's fine and sleeping but posey's going a little bonkers because we usually play outside all the time and so it's the morning early in the morning uh and yeah i wake up looking like this we're gonna show you guys our morning routine with three kids we're waiting until tuesday so savannah's mastitis is mostly better she's been taking antibiotics and she's mostly better she actually got to a 103.5 fever yesterday so but luckily those fevers only last like 24 48 hours so she's pretty much woke up feeling a lot better so we're gonna have a mostly normal morning routine we waited until tuesday because yesterday was labor day no school and we kind of wanted to have like a normal school morning routine as well so i'm up usually first thing in the morning i wake up because savannah stays up through the night breastfeeding the baby and that kind of thing and she lets me sleep so i usually let her sleep in a little bit more and i usually wake up around 6 30ish with posie as she wakes up so i'm gonna go get posey right now good morning turn a little light on   hi good morning yeah elmo so this is posey sleep sack that we put her in every night instead of a blanket it's like a sleep sec you're going to hide the baby   oh yeah okay come here keep a little kiss it's very nice so we wake up and then we go downstairs change diaper um get some milk and then sit down and usually watch some kind of tv show right snuggle for a little bit hey can you give me a binky can i give you the baba good girl working on binkies only at night time or sleep time right even though she loves it hey the bubble's almost in the microwave let's cut the three one two three so yep like i said most mornings closing i'll just wake up and she'll get her bottle and while she's drinking her milk um we'll watch coca melon or something like that i'm sure your parents know about that um and then sometimes sometimes mama will come down earlier with the baby if the baby wakes up earlier like this how are you feeling yeah i told him yesterday he got up to 103. how's baby he looks awaken alert hi hi good morning buddy good morning good morning usually you're still asleep but early morning this morning yeah that's fine it's like oh wait is this going oh freak out we don't put the baby in front of the tv to watch pokemon go we gotta wake up everybody she's at school wait where were you 99 that's like pretty much no fever lois you been the town you're good baby you're in the clear hey perfect timing for the morning routine we were going to film it yesterday guys well we were going to film it yesterday but you woke up in euro 103.5 so like um let's not do that today oh i was so miserable yesterday he's so cute okay let's go get him up posey what are you all done with your bottle   is it all done did you drink it all where'd it go i got caggie   that's just all right whoa look at this girl she's already up how do you have to wake you up gotta wake her up the whole family's waking up early i think it's gonna be like the best day ever maybe either that we're all just trying to show up for the morning or the worst day ever or worst ever most likely that's gonna happen with me in 2020. part of the morning routine is savannah always picks out and lays out everything's outfit most mornings if she lets it yeah she lets you some mornings everybody just pick out whatever she wants but my hair is like hard   don't don't worry i can fix it look at my hair if you do it if you do what i do with my hair then it'll always look good model boy model status yeah model status   is it just me or is he just too handsome for a baby   we're not trying to brag everyone literally makes your bed every morning i always whenever i walk out of the room i always look back and check if my room sleeps and my bed's not made i have to go there yeah it kind of stresses you out a little bit yeah i get it   all right for breakfast this morning what are we doing bagel bagel we usually never do bagels but i just bought bagels so do you guys want bacon cream cheese fruit yummy yeah what do you have for lunch okay so today i have oh fire the booty and then this is ranch that i could dip my um chicken and then we have some peanuts some cheese and some um crepes great thank you i forgot what they're talking about all right this is the first time posey's ever had a bagel i think she's gonna do what she does with peanut butter and jelly and she's gonna scrape off the strawberry cream cheese on top and only that not the bagel but we'll see that's my boat   we got a little homeboy and a swing are you still hungry okay uh if they're having breakfast can i have breakfast run too cheap breakfast get your backpack gotta turn the alarm off we got an alarm don't even don't even think about it disarmed okay um all right then we're out of here so usually i'll drop her off sometimes savannah will just kind of and then we listen to some music in the cup some rap gangster thug music is really hyped for second grade private school so time to yeah the baby's in here let me see what are we doing wow oh my goodness oh posey is this fun are you kind of jealous maybe cut out the hitting part here's here's a coffee for my lovely bride thank oh you goodness you have elmo so this is the biggest problem is we'll give posier breakfast i'll usually make breakfast at the house but for the sake of time i picked up breakfast on the way home and um no matter if i make it or pick it up posey will have her breakfast and then she'll try and steal my breakfast that's what always happens nice thank you for throwing that yep hey get that out of here who needs that i already made you yours um this is for me

dropping everything out to school posey ran up to me new zealand was playing on the little thing savannah went to go and take uh her antibiotics for her mastitis which we said she was getting better and right after she took her antibiotics which is why we kind of stopped vlogging for a little bit um it got so crampy and i started growing up it was so bad guys it's so bad but it went on for like three hours it was like it was like from like eight to noon almost four hours so she wasn't doing too good so um don't know how we just kind of forgot to talk about that had a bad reaction to the antibiotic that's what we're thinking cause it happened right if we took it but we don't really have i don't know but uh yeah so that just kind of happens sometimes it's nice but but all in all your

we don't want to see that family much um so we're gonna go to florida and we're gonna go see my family and um we're so excited we're so excited just kind of travel kind of scary but kind of scary but we're just gonna make sure that we're really safe and you know flights especially the fight that we're getting is like one of the top as far as like the safety levels so we're going to be super careful we have lots of movements excited to travel we're excited to travel a little z-man first time on a plane i'm the kind of guy we're literally i'll our flight's at 9 30 in the morning we'll leave our house at 8. i'll start packing at 7 7 30 tomorrow morning yeah i don't stress out about many things but i stress out about packing and him packing at five seconds before we leave bounce because he always forgets something i usually do but yeah so let us know if you guys are the kind of people who pack super last minute if you like savannah where she's packs for herself and for zealand and for everything for posey the day before the diaper bag for the playlist toys snacks she does it all   packing and packing and packing and packing vlogging and holding my baby   oh here's the cold he's like this is nice hey it probably reminds me of the womb uh-huh and then mommy daddy like hello good morning hi it's time to fly got the bags all packed oozy are you ready to go fly on an airplane this can be crazy so everybody actually lost a tooth last night so we're checking to see we lost two i bought seven bucks for this tooth and now i lost that tooth yesterday night any money ten bucks oh my goodness just for that little too what the heck we should pull out more teeth so then you get more money here say oh do you have any more wiggly teeth no all right hey that's not too bad probably oh it's really good five people three bags backpack little stroller back light y'all kinda light made it through security this isn't too bad because nobody's here because of clothing right now oh he's here we're going to denver 14 this way first up denver colorado tampa florida what are you doing can you hop like a bunny let me see hop on the layover we got some yogurt we got some breast milk for big boy everybody's got a pretzel a nasty pretzel dog     we're officially in florida everyone what do you have to say for yourself she loves this place oh whoa that's off again what do you have to say oh whoa okay i gotta have some good reaction holy moly guacamole so posey actually oh my gosh okay hold on pose actually fell asleep for like two of the three hours on that flight so that fight was actually pretty easy because zealand's easy than the first one kind of because posey slept yeah there's really no difference of having three kids yet besides the fact that um we just don't sit by each other anymore savannah and i have lost all touching and romance on flights it's strictly keep these kids alive i'm sorry guys i'm trying so hard to get my nose in this thing i'm sure it'll get a lot harder once he is awake once he's awake whenever he's at posey's age and posey's three oh it's gonna be a mad house trying to fly but this one wasn't too bad and it's crazy because we left early morning in california and we just landed and it's already dark here in florida that's how the time difference and how long it is it's fine pretty much dark it's dark so we're here with my mama party time and my dad yeah we're in florida slow it up how hot is it nice and humid it's not too hot but but it but it is dark out and we're in an underpass so we made it to florida it was so cute it's late i'm going to bed but i always think it's so so funny whenever he's in this thing he's he's like it just reminds me of like a caterpillar like in a cocoon or like a crazy person in a straight jacket he's so chill does he even give a smile hi okay no not you no okay not today sorry we'll eventually get a smile camera he just smiled he doesn't smile it's kind of hard on camera but we're just here we're going to bed and we'll vlog a little bit in the morning a florida life and maybe we'll meet the grandparents reaction to new zealand because they haven't seen him yet goodbye   okay so it's morning time here in florida we're about to go out and have a fun day with the family but before we did um we wanted to talk with everybody about something and we just feel like this is super important to talk about and to remember and to talk to their kids about and make sure that they're aware and that they just know over our nation's history and things like that um especially even so much more important because yesterday we actually flew on 911 and it kind of makes me a little sad because i booked those flights over the phone and whenever i put those fights i forgot i didn't even cross my mind that way that i was booking on 9 11. i just was booking a flight for september 11th and then it was after i booked the flight i told savannah and she was like we're flying on 911 which is something that i think just is naturally a little eerie and um can be a little a little freaky um but does that even make any sense to you like do you even know what 911 is no no no idea and that's why we're talking with her about it i feel like she's seven she's at an age where she can understand but we didn't want to tell her before we started flying or while we were flying so now it's the next day and we aren't flying and we don't want her to be scared the whole time but um 9 11 is a day where 19 years ago i was 5 years old i was in kindergarten and your mom was your age pretty much and we were in school and i still remember it and everywhere in school the news came on all over the country over the whole world pretty much the news came on and some airplanes flew some bad people took over an airplane like where the pilots were some bad people rushed in killed the pilots and they took over the airplane and they flew the airplane into buildings and killed a lot of people and the airplanes exploded and buildings blew up and wait so what was that today that was yesterday yesterday it didn't happen yesterday but on that you know like you have a birthday you're gonna be celebrated every year it's like that's like it happened on that day but it's a day that everybody wrote it's called 9 11. not a happy moment why not obviously 9 11 because 9 is september the 9th month and 11 is the 11th day so yesterday was 9 11. like if you're in class 15 your birthday's 12 14. so on 9 11 every year we sell it we don't celebrate but we remember it we remember it because a lot of people died and it's really sad and a lot of families were just on a flight like us it was like 19 years later a lot of people just were flying to see family they're flying just to have a normal time and there are four it's four different planes right yeah those four different planes people that bad guys jumped in hurt the captain and then rushed the planes into there's just they're really tall towers in new york it happened in new york and a few other places but but this is a video of one of the buildings in new york these buildings aren't new york anymore because these were the some of the tallest towers in new york but you can see how smoking and on fire that's because one of the planes crashed into it and everybody who was on the plane died and a lot of people in the tower there was all people working in there people were working in here while the voting caught on fire and what you're gonna see is you're gonna see it's kind of blurry but you're gonna see another plane crash into this building okay so this is what happened 19 years ago this is this is the real thing this is a real video it's not like a movie or something this really happened you see the explosion   that plane crashed into it so it didn't see it yeah it's on the other side yeah and it's so fast but that that's how fast it would be um and then that really happened and it's sad because and the people the bad people even yeah so we kind of off camera showed everybody some some things and some stories of some of the people and it's just super tragic and really sad and that's part of the reason why now whenever you go through airports they do the security back then the security wasn't they had it that's intense yeah they had airport security but it was a lot easier to go through but because bad guys were able to sneak weapons on planes um now that's when they pat you down they check your bags and make sure that you aren't taking anything that could wait but they how do you like did they like stop the building or do they just crash they think how did the bad guys go just like they did a normal personality yeah it just looks like you and me you just buy a ticket oh and then they had like but they were able to sneak sleep a thing in their bag and they shoot the guy so they can i don't know the exact stories i don't know the exact story so i don't want to say anything that good but essentially they were able to sneak airport security wasn't as strict as it is now so they were able to sneak things on the plane to help them hijack the plane hijack means take over so they were able to take over the plane so they probably had scary weapons that how did they know what to fly i don't know yeah they knew how to fight the plane these bad guys were very trained and they they knew what they wanted to do but i remember waking up the morning that it happened my mom my i heard my mom like crying out in the family room and this is when i lived like in san jose like when i was little and i heard my mom and my dad out in the family room so i walked out and i remember i was your age and i was like looked at the tv and i was just like what's happening like i was so confused like you would be so confused if you saw that on the tv right that's scary because nobody knew what was going to happen next my mom kept me home from school that day obviously that's everyone else's parents usually yeah school school was cancelled pick up their their kids from i think all flights were canceled for like almost a week just because nobody knew if it was gonna happen again you know it wasn't it was those two towers and other planes crashed in other places is what said what's that too is like police officers and firefighters and helpers like that also died from helping thousands of people died trying to get people out of buildings and stuff like that like it was a bit really big deal but that's why it's really sad but that's why we always want to remember those people who who lost their lives and who just died tragically or died saving people well it's good it's important it's a good history lesson for you to learn about too then you know and now you know what 9 11 is do you have any questions no no well um our thoughts and prayers obviously go out to any of the victims or victims family members who were involved in 9 11 i know that it goes far beyond just obviously the people who died but the people who um were hurt or injured or were in new york during that time or all over the country um it's just unimaginable um so could did everybody hello we're home from florida we had a great time we did not vlog i love being in florida but the story we're about to tell you finally it was a long trip um essentially we were in florida had a great time with my family saw some family members that we hadn't seen in so long so much fun so much fun a hurricane is it's a tropical storm stirring in florida the whole time that we're there in terms of hurricanes right crap we're gonna have to fly out through a hurricane hurricane sally it's literally happening right now um we get to the airport and we're there 50 minutes early but they tell us that um in order to check our bags you have to be there an hour early our airport you can get to in like 20 30 minutes before the flight because it's like a small one and you're good so we got to do this in 15 minutes early like oh we're good i think it might have been like 45 but it wasn't like something like that it was close she said you had to be an hour early i was like crap we're almost an hour early i was furious we're already so sleepy because the night before we went out with friends and we had stayed up really really really late and so we were already exhausted so we like we in the morning he was like should we just make our flight for later that's why we were running late because we were almost something just do it and i was like let's just do it and we're exhausted like going to the airport like we got ourselves up and then like nope sorry can't get on this plane and you guys know how hard it is to get up early in the morning with a little two little babies a seven-year-old pack it all up pack the car seat put my wrap on put the baby the stroller all the stuff finally get there and say oh you're 10 minutes late yeah get back in call my mom and brother pick up they pick us up from the airport go back home wait seven hours get back to the airport do all that again yeah we end up having to fly around the hurricane so instead of through it which is it's already then it was longer it's already it's already like nine nine hours of travel so it turned into like 11 12 hours of travel because we'd fly to chicago back home we made it back last night midnight but we're here and we're safe that's all that matters we're complaining a lot but we're home we're safe we got to see family and it was a lot of fun so but the babies were so good and everly but she's always good the babies were so good on the plane so that made it really easy and nice but all in all traveling with little babies is so hard just even with them being very easy so much have you had to carry but um we're about to play a fun game this man has no idea about so i'm going to set that up i'm excited i can't believe it's not butter spray trying to make it liquidy in the bottom let me do it so savannah has no idea what's going on i don't know she's just helping me fill this here i need but i hope i get this one because i actually like but she knows that has something to do with drinking that's can you label these for me sure we have um soy sauce your breast milk uh for real that's well because you have little breast milk things in here um we have italian i'm not drinking my own italian dressing and i can't that's probably good i can't believe it's not butter and then we need three more random nasty juices oh this is good olive juice if it's not butter it's not bad and that's where one of the better ones there we go um yeah but look yeah how about this sharpie on it yeah you can i'm pretty sure this expired what is that this is just oh oh that was nasty okay so like i said savannah has no idea what we're doing but uh just saw this now i kind of think i know everything kind of an idea so we have seven different drinks here labeled one through seven i saw the sauna our friends justin gabe i haven't i have a shower in like four days ew yeah i'll get a shower after this video but that's why i had a hat called okay so i just showered um i saw this on our friends justin gabe's channel shout out to them um but essentially it's um say it or shot it so essentially i asked on instagram you guys to submit a bunch of difficult or awkward questions for us to ask each other and you either have to answer it or pull something out of this hat and take a shot of whatever it is if you don't want to answer it yeah yeah so i screenshotted like 20 30 questions and essentially we can just pass my phone back and forth and ask each other the questions okay okay you want to go first or second um by the way your your hat left the letters on your forehead of whatever that was auto i love games you ready okay other than me who's your second favorite boyfriend oh i have to say that like on the youtube video no no you don't want to but if you don't let me take a shot is this your actual secondary boyfriend okay who eric eric because he was really nice eric i hate you well no shot for you dang it screw you eric what's your least favorite thing about me you can save time what is it your face okay my least favorite thing about you yeah um you can be really stubborn yeah you can be really stubborn and and and not like a kid's devin whereas i go to the kids seven like she's an adult and she shouldn't be stubborn but sometimes she can be i mean we all can be but i am i'm very sorry even like a little more so than the normal person so a lot okay round one under the rug okay we still love each other yeah okay i don't like eric though let's see okay so we have a lot of people asking really immature questions which i i like i think these are funny but just so you know this is what's coming your way you ready when was the last time you really got in there had a good nose-picking session secretly when was the last time you like got away just you and you had to like get it out you never never oh my gosh oh it's man i've never had a good nose picking yeah you you have to actually tell me an answer of when or you gotta take a shot i'll just shot it okay oh great you have one number and we don't we don't have any i guess you want this i can't believe it's not butter one right what number you get three you freaking got your breast milk so gross we we we drink go back and watch uh he drinks breast milk for a challenge just throw it back you want half of it with me no i didn't i didn't get it i didn't get it you did just do it just do it come on we got we got a whole game to get to three ready three two one oh it doesn't taste bad that's really it is gross will you get my drink for me i do not want that taste in my mouth honey you gotta wash it out yeah the best one okay when is the last time you really oh that was my question oh this is a good one okay what celebrity do you find more attractive than me oh no one no one's more attracted to me no there's lots of people more attractive than me which one you want to answer only you you have to answer it or you can take a shot or jennifer anderson   okay i can't even round about that because she's like she's your mom's age probably okay okay she is very attractive gray and different has gotten more attractive yeah i think that she's way more pretty now really than she was when she was like younger i just think she's always just been a beautiful one that's a good one though because i i think she's very pretty yeah and that's the first thing that came to my head yeah i was good about him so okay so this one kind of this one kind of goes with what um what you asked me who would you want to be with if you weren't with me oh probably like   um like channing tatum or um who else is yeah oh liam hemsworth yeah for some reason in my head i had it like you like you had to say like something that we knew but i guess no i would never do that yeah i'm not even mad about that that's not stupid for me to ask you describe your last pic i was hoping to ask you that one describe your last poop like in detail like really describe it like when it was where you were what happened during it what your face looked like you really want me to take a shot you have to really get in detail here and savannah's mom if you're watching this fast forward it cuz i'm gonna say it so if you don't like poop talk okay can you just take a shot i'm gonna say it no you're not saying that you're not saying that you have to take it because i don't want you saying that you guys watching us know that i would describe my last book but who's taking my wife and and the viewers and the viewers our family members family oh right right hand i think right hand is seven oh geez the freaking expired almond juice all right go go yeah it wasn't too bad it tasted like ocean water what's one thing you struggle with probably just like mom guilt mom girl when i shouldn't have it when like i know i'm spending so much time with them yeah not really like i shouldn't i shouldn't have the guilt but i do you know that's actually really good that's a good answer that was very well thought out yeah mom because that's very accurate with you because she's like we're all the best mom in the world loves all of our kids a hundred percent equal cannot love them all more equally but struggle with that okay best kiss before you met me who is your best guess i know there's a lot of girls i know there's a lot of them just kidding guys i think how many girls have you kissed before me like three four a lot i mean you said it

i answer i'm gonna be answering it jokingly okay so i'm not so i'm not gonna answer it it's fine but i'll take one that's more interesting i'm not gonna answer that seriously oh yeah she was a really good kisser four oh italian dressing that's that's gross that's probably the the grossest one that you could have got out of these yes we saw something yeah like all those are food and actual drinks thick italian drinks let's see if you can do it in under five seconds i'm gonna start cutting already five four three two one was that so gross down you good oh this is fun this is fun we should do this all day okay what's your biggest secret i think it's the secret you can't you can't answer this one you have to just take your shot what you know you're not going to spill your biggest secret why i mean you can go for it i don't know what it is but like if it's your biggest secret you're really just gonna juice or something or butter she's trying to get the butter you could do all these pull out that one's yours what is that oh i don't want that one yeah tomato juice it's not tomato juice guys it's like tomato it's super the thick and consistency yeah but it's not it's not like heated up

cool it's pretty cool cool we're super honored and really excited really nervous but it's gonna be fun we're trying to figure out which dress she's gonna wear so this is option a   so you like pick these out while you're still pregnant and you didn't get like so no this this is my size right now you guys are wondering everybody's downstairs having some zeal in time zeon's asleep but they're just kind of chilling chilean chilean chilean since the wedding's tomorrow i'm gonna be like the audience of the wedding okay okay or do you want me to like pretend like i'm like the bride i could just like ruin this whole wedding you could ruin it yeah what if you do ruin it   see the bride i think so come like stand up there with you i'm actually the very first person to walk on the aisle i walk on the aisle and then and then and you stand right here and then you walk up and i'm behind you and then i say and i'm like on this side i say who takes who takes this look look wow oh man let me poke that that's a creepy at the wedding so i want that distraction so i'm gonna say who gives this woman to be married to this man and he says i do yeah the dad hands off the daughter yeah and then okay yep there's that nice on behalf of katie and richard and their families we would like to welcome you all to the celebration we are gathered here today in the presence of god to join this man and woman and holy matrimony you may all be seated and everybody's saying everybody sits down and then it's science and then it starts all lies and then this is the big deal that if you mess up i don't know oh also remember that we're christians this is a christian wedding so there's going to be a lot of biblical and christian references so if you ain't a christian you're probably not going to be like cool with what i'm saying hi baby you want a butterfly she likes butterfly filters on my phone we can do that later okay okay i'm gonna open it up with this like talk about how like beautiful the wedding the venue the fact that we're able to have a wedding yeah because katie has had katie they originally had to postpone the wedding for like three months change wedding venues because the old wedding video with covenant couldn't do all the stuff yeah i'm gonna like share a little bit about that just like what it took to get here you know the fact like man that's a good idea beautiful you know obviously with with coven and quarantine and a lot of their family members and friends they want to come can't come um so just kind of like you know talk about that where we're at in our country um you know very briefly open up that and then i'm gonna say the bible teaches us that a christian wedding is a covenant of faith and trust between a man and a woman who both share the same type of faith and commitment to the lord let us pray so pray we pray and then it gets really serious now i'm gonna be the audience okay because this is like the serious part you know i want to like take it all in all right ready yeah okay so today is such a fun and exciting day we're so excited to be here with katie and richard today today's the day you two will cherish forever you will never forget this day all throughout your lives as long as as long as you may live there will be tiring days that test your love for one another more importantly than today being fun and exciting today is a holy day today is a covenant the commitment that you two are making to each other and to god today is more powerful than you will ever know yeah that's good yeah this is all very good you did a great job okay day by day as you go through trials as you go through tribulation as you go through the hardships you will realize that the commitment that you made to each other the significance of that commitment as you grow old as you have kids all of this is important the bible has a lot to say about marriage justice 2 says the lord god took the man and put him in the garden and needed a tendon keep it and then i will make him a helper   what if i just started yelling i i i i the lord god caused him to fall into a deep sleep she's starting to get stressed out she's like oh my god yeah you're getting there and then can i compare this is happening today katie and richard present day adam and eve you know you come one one flesh i love it yeah get into that how marriage does it get from god this is good this is all good yeah yeah another another bible verse um i said that a chord of three strands not easily broken so you got katie richard and god three strands not easily broken not nope not easily and uh matthew mikey 325 says a house divided against itself cannot stand so the two of them must become a team yes if they want their houses the two shall become one the two shall become one you know i'm essentially just kind of giving like a love sermon yeah essentially it's cute but uh that's you know that and then we'll get into their vows they wrote their own vows i'll say repeat after me you know katie this oh just not mess that up what if you mess up the rouse the hardest part is that you know i stutter oh he's you guys he's not um he's not the best reader and uh my reading is like i like third grade level so we do the vowels and then i say who has the rings do we do the rings talk about the significance of handing each other the reigns and that commitment and then you might kiss the bride how should i do that yeah yeah yay yay you are a good audience now i'm just gonna give you the best reaction all right okay yeah yeah watch that watch that watch it sit and watch daddy you may kiss the bride no   whoa yeah she liked that one   yeah she really likes when you do that so that's what we're gonna be doing and then i say i now pronounce you oh here's the hardest part i now

talking about the piggy from the um from the zoo just the petting zoo piggy okay so um we're doing our family intro and we're getting ready and we're super excited because the first intro was zealand and has a family of five so crazy we haven't had an intro for like the past two months of videos yeah you should brush daddy's hair this is gonna be so cute because we have a little boy in our intro now you should just be a bunch of girls yes and if you guys are wondering we got a new dog check it out hi hi youtube hello welcome to the family oh just kidding that's uh that's grandma's dog grandma's dog's here because we'll probably be using gigi to film our intro because you know we usually have like here by chrissy and her team come in and get us ready and whatever else but we're not doing that this time we're just kind of like going for it gigi on uh everybody's hair straightening out we actually just got back from church not long ago so yeah fixing that up a little bit and then mama and apples are safe you've seen for the past five he's a stupid boy so what we're doing is i'm thinking that i'm going to jump off like an elephant elephant yeah because i have one coming we had one coming out i'm gonna jump off the elephant and then i'm going to like do that like tarzan yeah yeah to you okay and then you essentially you just start running running running running where do i run you just start running and then and then after that we'll you know go pick the strawberries from the garden out there and then from our strawberry garden did you plant that yet no no i should go plant the strawberry again yeah okay and then voice after that and then and then the kids will all eat everywhere they eat a strawberry say no they're gonna start swimming and then we'll go pro them underwater swimming to the strawberries wait hey   all right guys we are back at posey's favorite spot the petting zoo yes yes there you go yeah you gotta put in the piggy's mouth you can do it look you you take it and you put it in the piece like this and look he eats it yay give it to that piggy yucky put the carrot in his mouth good job yes yes all the way all the way you gotta do a little bit more you can do it oh definitely one of the favorites oh he's so nice he go he's an apple do you like the llamas we just see if we can buy this guy and take him home posie what's this look it's a llama oh my goodness so cute hi boy hi boy hi boy what's that   baba sheep yes that's your real sheep oh hi little friends sheesh i thought i'm chewing on my shorts i looked down my shorts are gone hello oh hello they're kind of all over the place it's kind of like a scary movie with goats this guy almost looks pregnant oh this girl oh oh whoa whoa whoa look at posey she's like whoa whoa the friendly they say but they still kind of creep us out a little bit oh look at these bunnies what do you think say hi bunnies   oh you want to hold the bunny yeah i don't think we're allowed to hold the   bunnies suppose you could literally stay at that place for hours is that fun are you happy yeah we gotta go though say see you later   hello honey what you doing should i leave yeah i actually want to tell them about this okay pretty awesome okay um so i know a lot of moms have a lot of questions about like my favorite baby products you know baby number three yep done they're pumping for a while yeah done the pumping for a while a pro comfort yes so i really really really like right now the dr brown's it's um the custom flow double electric breast pump um it's it's this whole thing so it's really lightweight which is nice it has this little thing around it where you can like store everything inside you can even like put some snacks in there if you want if you're like taking it with you wow but it's so cool because here i can actually turn it on and show them but there's like different controls so there's different settings you can like customize them you can make it go high or low and there's different um like there's a slow pump and then there's like a well there's a fast pump that it starts and then like once the milk starts coming in you can like slow it down to where it gets more milk out so there's different like custom settings like that but it's really cool so i'll plug it in and i'll show you guys those settings but interesting it's really cool um and then after which is nice is i have the breast milk storage bag so i can just easily pour the bottles in the stored bag should i just put in the freezer should we show them our freezer i know i don't know you guys we have a whole freezer dedicated to my breast milk because i pump all the diet because i have so much milk so we figured this out so savannah makes so much breast milk and posey was like literally always choking on how much milk savannah produced and so zealand zealand's always like he can't keep up but we figured it out it's because savannah's first baby was everly who ate her dry and if you guys knew little everybody everybody ate everything in the world so i think that savannah's body how do i get used to like oh i'm gonna make kids who eat like insane amounts of food and milk yeah and our other two kids haven't done that so now she's just you guys my routine is like i have to pump once a day so like a really good pump is essential for me especially one that's not gonna make me stressful and that's just really easy to use and i love this one like it's just so easy to use it doesn't hurt me when i'm pumping and it just gets all the milk out and it gets the job done it gets the job done i'll tell you guys like a few of my favorite features about it but it's the best you guys have to try it out so it has custom settings extra storage and bottle holders and soft silicone flanges for comfortable pumping and i can customize my experience because it has separate suction cycle setting simple intuitive controls and two pumping modes so another thing is this is an all silicone shield which is really nice because it's flexible so it just goes on there very nicely and really gets everything out um unlike other breast pumps where i feel like they're not flexible because they're not silicone which is nice also it comes off so you can clean it really easily and then when you're ready to store it after you're done pumping so easy you just take it off you can apply the storage caps and you can put them right in the fridge and then also if you want to freeze it you just put it into this bag it's really easy it goes perfectly in the bag i can even show you guys never spills goes right in and then you can just mark it with the name the date and you put it right in the freezer and i have a million of these in my freezer so these breast milk storage bags are different than others that i've used because they're super durable they have a double zip seal to keep air out and they have this cool bottom that lets the bag sit upright while i fill it this set is awesome because it includes dr brown's award-winning options plus anti-colic bottles which are my favorite because i know that they are best for my baby designed by a doctor and recommended by pediatricians they keep my baby happy and fuss-free without spit up burping and gas they preserve the nutrients of breast milk also the bottles make it really easy to switch back and forth from breastfeeding right now i use the slowest flow nipples so right now he's learning to take a bottle with the slowest flow nipple but soon he'll be on the next level the level one slow flow nipples so it's super easy to use you just turn it on press this button starts going so this is there's two different flows so this is the first flow and then this is the one where it starts getting more milk out because it's a slower and then there's different levels so you can go up like level eight level nine that's gonna like get a lot of milk out faster and then you can obviously go down but it doesn't hurt me i probably use it at like level seven and it's awesome super easy to use so i love my dr brown custom flow double electric breast pump and you guys should go try it out too okay i will not not you though not me you guys so we are filming our new family intro today so stay tuned for that we're waiting for everybody to get home from school so super excited i'm still kind of figuring out what we want to do we want to make it chill and family and us we're just like chill and like our house like on our bed almost just like us very easy we know as you guys know in the past we've had like hair by christy and her team come by and kind of like make it you know big and fancy and whatnot but we just feel like we've been like chilling at home so much recently obviously just with covid and new baby and so we just want to make it like us we don't want to overdo what we don't normally do perfect okay guys so we are done filming our intro it is edited and we are about to watch it the kids are in bed we're actually the baby's asleep in our room we're in zane's room because kids are sleeping in all the other rooms we're hiding out and we're such parents we're hiding out in the babies nursery like should we go in zealand's room because we have no other really bedroom to go into right now so we're in here all the kids are asleep but um we're gonna show you guys the intro and um we're gonna react to it and i hope you guys like it like we said we didn't really like too well out on this one we just wanted to be like casual and us i was like oh it was hard to get even what we got i feel like this was like the first intro or like it was hard it was kind of hard it was hard and yeah i don't really know how to explain it it was just like like we wanted like like cute smiley things of like the kids and stuff and like getting cute stuff on camera like it's so much harder because like posey literally smiles and is so cute and sweet all day and in that one hour that we were filming she just like had nothing to do with it and then zealand like is quiet and sleeps all day long and the one hour that we were filming was crying i'm sure your parents can relate you were like your kid like do something like all day long then you pull your camera like try and capture it and then they won't do it and you put your camera away and they do it like right away and that like explains like cozy hey we got some stuff we got this we're just giving the disclaimer that's not like all it's like incredible but i think it's cute i think it's cute and um it's our first family intro with all five of us so we're excited about it i haven't had one in a couple months so here we go you guys are ready to watch we think let us know what you guys think but we think it'd be fun to do a christmas intro this year again because our last year's one i feel like was like my favorite intro ever i kind of want to rewatch all of our intros with them after we see this one we watch all the old ones um since i had the best idea ever now we're gonna watch the intros before we show you guys so i don't know if you're gonna watch all of them i think we're gonna watch our very first one um we're not all of them we don't even have that many yeah let's just watch our very first one the the first one with posey and then there was this one those three and then and then our newest one now so okay this is our very first and you guys gonna watch at the same time with us three two     one   oh so that's where the come on let's roll came from is if you guys haven't seen the video of everly type in on youtube like cutest four-year-old vlogger lebron fam it's the cutest video that you will ever see a four-year-old because it's probably my favorite it was so cute like it wasn't a video that did like that good for us i thought it was like mega viral because it was just like so cute it was so cute we'll just type in right now i remember we remember like uploading and we're like oh my gosh everyone is gonna love this video it's so cute and i like didn't even do that but it's like one of our personal favorite videos but that's where the come on let's roll because he just naturally said come on let's roll okay so this one was like like we said the very first intro video with posey um and you guys really loved it we've i got like a lot of work and do this one and it turned out super cute and it had a different song than the aoe which is fun so ready and when we say we put a lot of work in it we actually just like got dressed in like but we left the house she did her hair we just got like she got her hair done by somebody okay here it is   yeah our next one that we do will probably be similar to this one yeah i even know exactly where i want to film it i want to film on like this cliff on the beach i'm like so beautiful we're just sounds so cute we're just in a place right now to where we we couldn't make that happen with this introvert we wanted a family intro but it just wasn't gonna happen yeah was it gonna happen it wasn't gonna happen and we just wanted to get an intro up because you know we're two months old we're really hyping down the entrance no it's really cute yeah but wouldn't be like their favorite because it's so just like it's literally all in one spot in our in our bedroom yeah it's filmed all in one spot like we're all like in pajamas like it's really just like chilling what i like about this one that we just watched is is the song is longer so the intro could be longer but you guys might like shorter intros so now we're gonna watch our christmas stitch that savannah loves so   much   come on let's roll it's funny because we a couple things really quick we want to cry emotional corals in it really sad um you're pregnant whenever we film this but you you we filmed this before we announced it yeah so obviously you can tell you're pregnant so little z was in the little belly um it was just really cute i love that one but now it's time for us to show you guys a really cute christmas one like that i guess what you're watching or what okay okay here we go here it is don't get your hopes up too high but we're really excited it's gonna be fun okay three two one come on let's roll oh there you have it okay the new labret family intro like we said nothing too special but it's it's us that's our family we

for the next intro but we're just like we want a family intro and then we went with something for the next few months and we just aren't gonna go and make this one happen like too soon but we got a

things are hard to make as is   oh       i think we're done with this with this part of the video no don't touch it hang on i can't do this by myself i don't know how you're doing it with us patience yeah yes patience sexy patience posey that was very good that you just remembered the patience what color is this what color is this yellow can you say yellow say yellow yellow yeah you can have a pink one you want to eat it oh what happened i walked away into the camera for a second and then uh hey we tried okay well i guess it was like the thought it was just like the time we spent together that counted right doesn't matter it doesn't matter that it broke she's okay she's happy yeah she's happy she didn't even know what you're doing the whole time she's like hold on mom what are you doing why aren't you eating this but it's okay i mean this was your first gingerbread experience how did you like it yes yes yes that's good yes was it fun fine yeah did you have fun hip hip hooray is upstairs putting posey to sleep real quick um she has dealing with her too and i thought i'll do a fun little test with her um most nights while she's putting posey to sleep or zealand to sleep if i'm lucky i get to play like 30 minutes an hour video game stuff so i'm going to be doing playing some video games but i'm gonna ask her if she wants to have another baby right now essentially we talk about it a lot but um it's always like we've agreed like hey we aren't ready for a baby now whatsoever let's just wait out another year two or three and see whenever we feel like we want another baby but i've never tried to convince her talker and they're having another baby so that's what i'm trying to do right now is like see if i can actually talk her and do it because of vanilla's baby so much if i was ready would she actually haven't been having me so she's coming   okay yeah you need help no i did it though you sure let me hold him no it's okay okay hold on i can hold him if you want i already got one i'm all good after your snack can you go come over here real quick i want to ask for something um 7 32.   jump down   um do you feel like you're like overwhelmed like the kids do you feel like having like two small babies and like i said when you was like too much no i don't know does it sound like it no no where are you kind of like the opposite like i think it's like so fun do you like them like those babies i'm so funny well you know i love babies i know i will just babies that's what i was gonna ask you about i was gonna you know we talked about essentially like a two-year play in new zealand like start trying like two years-ish so then posey and zealand are really close to an agent and see i'm in the fourth baby our last baby are like two issues apart but posey and zealand looks so cute i feel like maybe so cute like zealand and maybe i'm reporting even closer to age but you're like the last person i want that not a mean wave but i thought you for sure one of these ones have a big or at least i got bigger than trying at when the baby's 10 months old i don't know i just want to hear like your thoughts like like would you would it even cross your mind like to start trying and like then they would like be the same grade well no because it takes obviously nine ten months to have the baby and then we don't want it a december baby because everybody posing about december so if we start trying in december then it'll be like perfect time like september october of next year yeah that would be like exactly a year apart that's like crazy and serious yeah think about it this way we're such young parents we have all of our kids done i'd be done having kids what made you randomly think of this oh my god i can carry these off like a new tiny little baby i've been thinking about it for a while he's such an easy baby i feel like posey's overall pretty easy and evelyn's an easy kid for real i don't know i mean if you don't want to i just figured i'd ask if you think it'd be so fun think about it so you like actually want to try in like two months for another baby just like just like think about it i don't even know if my body like heals that fat of course people have like kids want to use a partner like who everybody everyone's friends in the dance studio whose girls are like one year apart i mean think about how cute would be posies zealand and i'm not enough not everybody's gonna go over but posing zealand and vape number four would all be like so close in age it'd be so fun i mean and you'd be done having kids like if you were like you'd be down for it i probably would i'm for real i probably would really because you'd be done having kids at 28 years old which means that we'd like empty nested by not that i like want to get there too fast but like we're already on parents so like what's what's the hold up i guess you don't sound too enthusiastic i guess i just never thought that you would say that i didn't either but what made you randomly want to do that i've been thinking about for a while i just wanted to talk to you about it until i was like because we've talked about it before and you're like we're waiting for two years or at least a two year age two or eight so we would wait for it yeah a year ago so that's just like five that was always my plan i don't know i feel like we always talk about things and just like happens well you kind of know that i would probably do it so would you actually do it yeah you actually want to try it like a month or two we're gonna get like three months we just well because you and we aren't guaranteed we got pregnant the person that we try yeah so we should just start trying now for when we start trying like thanksgiving like next month that's like thanksgiving to christmas we just try okay and if it's supposed to happen maybe we try like the new year starting in january yeah nice   so random that's all okay in january or december or november i'll just see it if you want to what yeah i don't want one so i'll just say if you wanted to i was joking you're just joking i was joking it was from youtube it's like the worst prank ever stupidest prank ever told you guys she would yeah i would she would she would have a baby you literally she was okay i was so confused because we actually talked we actually talked about it like a couple weeks ago now like we both were like on the she same page wait for like a year and a half okay i would i would i would do it but you don't want anything you don't think yourself on the whole we know that you want a million babies everybody here knows you won a million babies but we're not we're not but she she would and here's the proof i want another kid just right now do you actually when do you actually want to have nothing i told you i want zealand and then and the next baby to be like two years two or so smiley hey buddy boy see why do you think i want so many babies they're so cute and happy ain't nobody boy this is like if you seem like a little auntie sitting down like he really is the easiest baby ever but he gets antsy from seven to eight right before bed and it's 7 38 so okay guys we're getting the

fan of elmo yeah even like when she gets in trouble or time out or things like that she'll say elmo to like comfort herself she just she's obsessed with elmo we thought it would be so funny because she has like a bunch of elbow dolls and all the toys and as you guys saw she has an elmo halloween costume herself i thought it'd be so funny if i got an adult-sized elmo costume and showed up at the front door and we just filmed her reaction we ordered it like a week or two ago finally came in a giant elmo costume i'm about to put it on and um honestly i i hope she has an excited reaction but she

we love you all we'll catch you next video peace out good morning guys um it has been an eventful past 24 hours here in california especially here in orange county where we live i'll try to keep this short um explaining what's going on but essentially we we get fires all the time here in california everybody who lives in california knows that fires are just a way of life and it's tragic and devastation follows but it's just something that we learn to deal with it's kind of like i grew up in alabama my whole life and we just had tornadoes and my family's in florida and they have hurricanes and um here here in california there's there's really bad fires and um yesterday morning um a really bad fire started up uh close to irvine so we live about 20 minutes away from irvine um and uh one of our best family friends michelle foley sent us this video that i'm about to show you guys our house is right over here guys this is so crazy he's crazy oh my gosh look at all the ash oh my gosh there is an evacu involuntary evacuation in orchard hill which is down the street from us right over here   this is really bad there's oh my gosh oh my gosh that was scary oh my gosh we can't even see anything oh my god he just hit the car oh my god he hit the car so that video she took literally right outside her house so obviously her family got put into a mandatory evacuation zone as well as thousands and thousands of other people um had to leave their home so whenever that happens they're like where do we go what do we do and obviously we let them know like hey where we are is fine i mean we're only 20 minutes away and so it could obviously come this way but as of now i mean even the next day is perfectly fine so all this happened yesterday morning so um michelle ryan and their two kids pack up bags uh i come over to our place where it's safe and um it's it's really sad because obviously you you don't know what you're gonna go back to you don't know if it's gonna look the same you don't even know if your house is gonna be there um it's just a really scary situation to have to have to evacuate your home like that um so they came over and then we have some good friends corey and catherine who live in irvine as well and they got pretty much the exact same notice and fires by their house so they had to evacuate so we said come over we got space so they came over with their two kids and their pets and then as well as our assistant carrie and her daughter emily and their pets same situation they had to evacuate so three of our really closest family friends and best friends all all different families uh had to evacuate their homes and obviously we opened up our home for them to come and stay and we love we love hosting people we love having people at our home so it's been a blessing to us i'm in my car right now because um it's actually the next morning they all came over yesterday they all stayed the night last night it was like a big full house kind of situation and so much fun the kids love it but i'm in my car this morning because i'm actually going to make breakfast for everybody i think we have like 15 people or something at the house so i'm going to try to pick up enough ingredients to make a nice breakfast for everyone our hearts and our prayers go out to every firefighter every family affected by this one of our best family friends is a firefighter and he can just tell us on the front lines just how tragic and devastating it is himself so our thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family as well as every other family out there um if you're a firefighter watching this really your true hero and all of our love goes out to you and your family you have our utmost respect um and if you're a kid watching this and you have a family member who's a firefighter please tell them that they're a hero because they truly are and they especially out here in california i mean i couldn't think of a more uh admirable job so thank you guys so much um but i'm just gonna kind of vlog today it's just kind of fun and chaotic at the house so i'm just gonna film it it reminds me of full house like the tv show so here we go     what's

hair all the way off though i'm so confused wait jaden you got bigger you talk a lot better oh my goodness it's really pretty i like it i i like it i like it whenever jayden grey goes here i eat my dinner i eat my dinner so i don't you do what you do and you're strong you're right about that i'm ava i'm not jaded that's jaden oh you've known you've known ava for like a couple i mean you've known everything for a couple years but this is this is ava right you're ava yeah our turtle's alive and well guys giraffe harry styles bobby is surviving and we got this guy hello who i'm told is 14 years old and lost all of his teeth you know his tongue just tingles out of his mouth got a big dog big dog guard dog babe can you believe it we have cats check it out this is where one of the families is sleeping we got hey we do not have cats you guys we got cats well they got cats but they're staying with us now so technically we got cats look hey kitty me and cats would be really cool together oh yeah you started doing you started with that noise and it walked away yeah i didn't like that get some hairbrushing action going on nice hey can you brush my hair thank you just brush my hair we got another puppy here you love all the puppies here huh okay so something happened uh i guess i was bound to happen having so many people here so as you guys know we got our house and we got our guest house so very fortunate it's not like where my family comes and stays remember they visit from florida so we're having two of the families stay here um so two of the families are staying in here and it has three doors this one a sliding open this one is sliding open and one around the corner where everybody is trying to get inside somehow all three doors got locked from the outside in all the doors are locked and that's impossible because somebody would have to be inside to lock the doors it's not like you like have a key and you lock it you're inside and you push down to lock it nobody's inside everybody's outside so we figured it out the only way that it happened was a dog there's two dogs inside let me see if we can see a dog locked the door did we find the key no you didn't put the key so the dogs are walking here so we gotta figure it you know like call locksmith or something yeah i know it's kind of sad we need to we need we need to get the we need to if we can if we can get the big dog to jump again hey no he'd have to jump the other way he'd have to kick his foot up but what she must have done she had to have jumped up on the window and slit her paw down to lock the door jumped up to say hey everybody and slit her paw down to log it for real we have to call locksmiths that's for what's gonna happen because all their stuff is in here that's unfortunate bailey open the door bailey   doggy oh look oh look she's trying so watch your dogs guys because they can lock you outside your house yeah go walk outside your house right now say watch your dogs ready mm-hmm two

been to australia oh oh yeah oh yeah see it's working kind of okay so you've never been to australia and you've never been to over there once china and africa you've never been dead you haven't been kind i listen when you talk you do wow i thought you just ignored me because that's just all the stuff that you i remember you like telling people from amazing yeah guys i was on a tv show called the amazing race where we travel the world look it up cola bran family the amazing crazy thing i never even watched the amazing race like when we first met people were coming up to him like oh my gosh i went to another base where i see myself and like finally i was like okay what's the amazing race the amazing race is a tv show where you can travel around the world i bought his like uh episode my season his season on itunes i watched something and it was really cute because in it he like kept talking about his future girlfriend and then i was his girlfriend so i felt really cool all the time that i was watching my future girlfriend hey future girlfriend check this out i mean i still gotta like show i've been trying to re-watch those and show them definitely okay so to wrap up this video we're going to talk about something really quickly um because i feel like we get a decent amount of comments about it recently um just kind of like mean comments but you know like people ask me just like out of curiosity just like the fact that it really isn't as many videos or that everybody isn't as present in a lot of the videos recently and and that kind of thing so just kind of want to touch up on why that is um tell them so what everly something bad so everly obviously goes to school five days a week her school is a private school so they're going right now it's not like it's not like some schools where she's obviously half the time with quarantine she was home she was home for like six months straight so she was like every single video and she was in that dance there was nothing so she was just with us 24 7. so it went from like being with us all the time like now i feel like like i honestly like get sad sometimes because i feel like like i don't get to spend like as much time as i would like to but they're like now given she's only gone three three of the days a week you know so but but it still feels like a lot like it feels like we'll at least use one of those days to film so that's why probably she's you're only seeing her like once a week in our videos we only film twice a week and she's probably only in one of our videos a week maybe or she and and sometimes she's in more but she's friends yeah so she goes monday no not monday tuesday wednesday and thursday she goes we drop her off at school he usually drops her off at 8 15 at school i pick her up at 2 45 we go straight to dance like we have to rush there i pick her up and we're like hurry and hurry and hurry getting in the car we go straight to dance i go into the bathroom and help her change she goes to dance and she's gone until like eight o'clock at night and then i go pick her up she comes home does homework really fast it goes straight to sleep like that's our day wednesday thursday tuesday wednesday and thursday so like i feel like those days i really do not get to see her like we talk in the car for 10 minutes on the way to dance and like have a little conversation she loves it that's it i mean it's like she's she doesn't feel like overwhelmed she loves it but i just like feel like she's gone so much i like feel i feel kind of sad and bad about it because like i'd love to spend more time with her but she's just those three days like i don't get any time with her at all because she's just go go go go but she likes it overall um and then other times like once a week usually it's one of those days but once a week she'll go sleep at my mom's house just because i'm some of you guys might not know my mom really helped me raise everly for the most part like she was a huge part of her life um because i lived with my mom because i was 19 when i had her so my mom really helped me when like i would go to school i would i was in college and she would watch everybody while i was taking classes or just like working and so my mom was a really big part of every life so when i got married i always promised my mom like because my mom was really sad when we moved out like cried her eyes out so i said i'm single at the moment yeah my mom's single too so she's by herself so my i told my mom everybody can sleep at your house once a week like it's almost like a little parent custody thing like like she can sleep at your hospital it she loves her she she indeed you're like bffs yeah which i love but so she for the most part i mean there's some times where she doesn't sleep at her house once a week but for the most part she's actually once a week so like one of those days either tuesday wednesday thursday she's gone at my mom sleeping like at so i don't even go pick her up from dance that night and it's usually we'll do that on like our bible study night because we have bible studies wednesday so it makes sense for her to go sleep at my mom's because we'd have a babysitter anyways um so then there's that and then on sundays um for a couple hours she'll hang out with her dad which is great i think it's amazing that she gets to see your dad for a couple hours on sundays but um like i feel like sundays are just like our family day where we like go to church we go to lunch we're like go to the park we do fun things and then like she's also gone for a couple hours on that day so i just feel like lately it's time we typically just don't film that function and we don't film it but so that's my sister like in reality i feel like she's like gone a lot more and and and it's all it's all good stuff like that she has like literally like 20 30 friends from school and dance and they have birthday parties and sleepovers and all this other stuff and we just want her to be able to be a kid and go to his stuff so saturday's like their sleep sometimes they're at our house but sometimes i'll go i'll go drop her off at a friend's house and she'll have a sleepover on a friday or saturday so i feel like and we just never want to make it to work just kidding you have to be in videos it's just and it's just if you're home and we're doing nothing and we happen to vlog and you're awesome but if not i promise you guys that she's around she's a busy kid she's getting older she loves being in the videos though she loves it but it's just we want you guys to be aware that she's getting older so she's not going to be in them as much just because she's a busy kid and i'm sure that'll happen with posey in five six years you know so yeah but obviously if you go back and watch all of our early vlogs whenever whenever everybody was like three four and like super young like she was in it all the time because we were just with her all the time so it just made sense but yeah okay now you guys know all right guys well we love you all thanks for watching give this video a thumbs up we promise that we're gonna do double the shout outs in this video so

ago it was 60 degrees now it's 90 degrees but it's okay because we were getting out of the house and enjoying the warm weather right posey say i think we've vlogged before we've been to zoo mars it's like it's like a petting zoo and it has pigs that you can feed and bunnies that you can feed and llamas you got mama and zealand back here check out little zealand he's got a toy he actually really

laugh nope nope okay all right so uh here's what's happening essentially everly has been begging us to create her own tick tock account for so long for those who don't know everybody's never had her own tick tock account um she doesn't have a phone she has a little ipod and we don't even let her have tick tock on the ipod because i just don't know how much stuff on there is kid friendly a lot of stuff on there is funny and appropriate but there's a lot on there that just isn't so i've always had like mixed feelings about tick tock obviously i really love tick tock because it's a big time dancer as you guys know and she loves doing all the tick-tock dances but the only time that we ever let her on tick-tock as if it's on savannah's phone and we're supervising it yeah she's never had her own tick tock but she's been begging guests because all of her dancers have their own tick tocks and essentially all her friends in general have been getting their own tick tock so savannah and i came to the conclusion that if we can supervise it and monitor it it might be time and okay to get her her own tick tock so with that being said we don't want her ever having the tick tock app on her ipod just because i don't want her scrolling through and seeing all this inappropriate stuff that she shouldn't be seeing so we're actually gonna buy a separate ipod that's just for every sick dog at least for now obviously we aren't gonna be crazy strict for forever but she's only eight years old so almost eight we just wanna supervise it and make sure that she learns social media responsibility and this and that's that way by the time she's 10 11 12 she's learned to be responsible with it so she has no idea that we're doing this i'm going to pick her from school right after this i think she's just going to totally freak out because she's really been begging us to have rolling tick tock for several months now so um i'm excited i'm excited to show her and pick her up and uh yeah a lot of fun   so how's school good good well hey um what's going on what's new how are you good good zealand looks happy yeah posey's asleep um so what do you think's going on right now why am i filming you i don't know she knows i'm rubbing the camera out suspiciously like this something's gonna go down um so me and your mom have a surprise for you but it's a bad surprise you're not gonna like it yeah you won't like it what we're taking away i'm just kidding the chair um what do you think are surprises i don't know do you have any guesses no okay so you have to at least have two guesses before we tell you just guess yeah i don't know i feel like it's something outside okay to do outside okay so that's one guess um   something that i might play with a lot okay maybe i don't know okay how about this you close your eyes and put your hands up what yeah i'm scared but hang on i don't want to get the wrong idea of that oh okay you know yeah thinking it's something that's not you know yeah i got you okay i i see i see what you're trying to like yeah yeah okay um then i'm gonna show you something okay are you ready well i'm gonna tell you something okay wait i'm gonna tell you something can i just tell her that it's not something before so that she's aware it's not it's not it's not a phone it's not it's not a cell phone yeah i know okay i don't want you to think that okay okay so we can just smile okay well now that she knows it's not a phone i guess we can do the original thing yeah okay ready okay i promise it's not stuff you're ready okay so close your eyes and put your hands out okay hey come on bring it over here okay i'll put the spider right there what no i'm just kidding he's not a spider but i'm being dead serious that it's not it's not a phone and do not peek okay do not peek okay but this is pretty much yours okay all right so open it up open it up are you confused   i'm scared don't be scared uh it's one two three four look at what the picture was   so me and your mom talked and we're gonna let you have your own tick tock and and because we don't want you having tick tock on your ipod we got a special ipod that's just for making tick tocks okay so so you can you can have your one ticket but we are going to have some rules okay but you can be excited but you're not going to be excited because it's a cool deal you can make your own account with your own profile picture and your name and stuff i haven't even done any of that so you can do all that stuff okay so it's your account it's yours but you know because we talked about it me and your mom going to manage it right because it's like a big thing i'll give it to you like so this this is this this ipod isn't going to be like always with you like this is going to be my ipod but it's yours when you want to do tick tocks essentially we'll we'll put it up someplace and then whenever you're ready to make tick tocks we'll get it down for you just like scrolling you can't you can't just get on tick tock and scroll yeah but whenever you want to make it ticked off you get the tick tock ipad and ipod and one of us is going to be supervising you too you're making appropriate tickets yeah and those are okay and then you can post them if you want to okay as long as they're appropriate songs and appropriate tick tocks yeah and it's supervised that a seven-year-old almost eight-year-old is appropriately making it trying to say everything right i think that that you should make your first tick tock or two or three like right now yeah but i don't have to well we gotta make one we gotta make here again we just don't know what you want and you guys you don't follow everything account because yeah it's gonna be like figure out what it is we'll give it to you get back the biggest tick tock right here over here one of these probably not there but yeah not me i'm too lazy the hardest part is that all the usernames are taken is there a way that we can like get everly rows every rose is taken and anything like kind of like that's taken geez how are there so many everything roses   i really dot rose like seven have we got row seven do you like that no but i'm about to eat eight so

favorite number wanna do eleven is at rose eleven okay one try yeah oh my god oh and we got rose eleven's taken okay so because all of the evil usernames were taken we think we found one so this is

kiwi co boxes um but i believe that dan zealand is taking a nap upstairs and me and posey have decided to work on this kiwico box so kiwigo inspires kids to be creative problem solvers and critical thinkers which i love and everything that they need for that are right inside of these boxes so i know it's so awesome so cool so we're gonna open up posies this one's for two plus but she's almost two so we're gonna yeah she's gonna draw on it we're gonna open it up show you guys what's inside but they also sent one this one's for everly which she's kind of getting into abby and then this one's for new zealand which is zero to 12 months um but we're gonna open up the two plus box and show it to you guys i love kiwico because their products are a great resource for learning at home this is a water play mat um a paintbrush and then what's cool about these is they make like little designs on the water play mat um you fill this up with water and then also it comes with a cute little book which i'll read to posey so you want to get started yeah yeah so each box comes with all the supplies you need for that month's project you don't need to go to the store to get extra stuff which i love because i'm so forgetful so i forget a little thing here and there and have to go to the store to grab stuff but that's this is perfect for me because it all comes in one box also what i love about kiwiko is they give you a new project every month so it never gets old what you're doing with the kids there's always something new and fun and i know i love that and i'm sure posey loves it too right posey okay so i love it because it comes with step by steps because i need that when i'm doing a project with the kids i'm not creative i just need help so it comes with the steps which i love so first we're gonna do the water we're gonna dip the brush paint the mat and then it just tells you how to have fun well she's been drawing on the um booklets that they come with in the box but now we're gonna get started on the real project so posie we have to fill this we have to fill this up with water okay yeah you wanna go fill it up with water yeah okay let's go do it so we're gonna dip the brush into the water can you do that dip it in good now you're going to start painting now we get to discover keylon's world with water paint ooh i love water paint because it's messy cozy he go

this guys we're going to take key lawn and his buddy around town and you can even dip them in the water and they leave trails as they go let's go to his house even though posey already got the entire

string light pillars over there our guest house oh look so cozy coz do you love the baby snowman he's so cute yeah there's a mommy snowman a daddy snowman and a baby snowman oh no you can't lie and tell me that doesn't look just so good cheesy sausage pasta my fave okay it's bedtime for the little buddy hey buddy boy sleeps in his own room this is the earliest i've ever got a baby in his or her room the earliest because ed was like five posie was six issues i'm gonna put him into it but we'll talk about in a second good night buddy say good night good night love you buddy boy one baby down two babies down third baby's not home yet a long dance   you fall right thing he stays asleep for like eight hours can you stop bragging on your baby he's just like so good do you like him you love him oh wow another baby oh don't say that why no no no no no like crazy so then i don't want another baby hmm how are you feeling right now after dropping him off in his room because usually you're not doing too good well he went down so easy he like loves his room but how are you doing i just watch him walk my phone's cracked but that's him it's like a little burrito in there this is definitely the earliest i've ever put a baby in the room because like i was saying everly was like four right was she four five five yeah because whenever we got married she was four and a half and she did not i really was five when she went into her room she slept with me like for five years she never even went in her crib or anything and then posey she was like seven months when she finally went into a room i think because at like five or six months we mostly had her in here in the bassinet and then i made cold drag her huge crib from her bedroom into here and put the crib next to our room to be like okay she can be okay true story she's crazy so then i watched her like do good in her crib for like a few weeks and i'm like okay she can go in a room that was like seven months so at seven months she went into her own room and like she slept through the night since she was like two months old but i was just like so paranoid and then zealand's earliest he's like he was three months when i first put him in there which was a couple weeks ago but i feel like i'm so paranoid because we had a really close family member and i don't want to like get details just for respect but we had a close family member pass away from sids when he was a baby so i feel like since i was like 10 when that i think i was 10 when it happened i was like either somewhere between like eight to eleven when it happened now so i remember it so perfectly like it scared me so bad that once i had kids   i was just like always paranoid about it about something happening to my baby while baby was sleeping and so i have like the owlette sock which i've showed you guys like in stories and stuff before that i put on all my babies because i well actually it wasn't there for everly but it wasn't invented yet but i put it on posing in now zealand it's like a sock that tracks their it's their oxygen and their heart rate right so that like tracks them while they're sleeping so if anything like goes off at all it'll alert me on there and on my phone and then i have this monitor and you this motor also like you can wrap them in one of those things instead of putting it on their feet like wrap them in it and it'll track their heart rate and stuff now so i feel like now there's like such cool technology stuff but i'm still like so paranoid just from that happening so i'm just always recognized for my babies in their rooms by themselves you're doing great honey i'm very clingy to new babies when they sleep you're doing great honey thanks you're doing a great job i got him in his room really early compared to the other two you know went from five years to seven months to three months yeah it's like i'm proud of you next baby you'll probably be like two weeks no i don't think i'll do that i was just gonna say my sister's like babies turned three four weeks old and they're in their room and i'm like you go girl like i don't know how you do that you go girl but it's awesome because our babies sleep through the night when they're super young so it's good it's good stuff that's good stuff okay well guys let's end the video if y'all enjoyed it this video thumbs up subscribe before subscribe turn post on

following we love you guys and we'll catch y'all next vlog what's up guys welcome back to another video we are super excited for today's video because a portion of it is sponsored by norton lifelock but um we haven't done a q a in a while and our last q a went super well and so many of you guys have so many more questions that we weren't able to get to so we're super excited for this and we really like doing these videos i'm very confused so if i should look here or freshman so guys we have like the screen our screen is next like right next to it we got the camera so for if it looks like we're not looking right at you guys but kind of like next to you guys i was kind of figuring that out in my head the whole time i was like it's going to be way too hard to not look at ourselves so i think we just so if we're looking a little bit that way i think we're looking at it forgive us but we always ask you guys like to ask us like the realest questions not dumb questions questions like the hard questions that you guys want to know so yeah i feel like they like these yeah like they don't find these are real i like this this is just like it's super raw yeah raw yeah that's the good real raw raw real you know what i mean and savannah has no idea because i asked the questions this time usually she asks the questions and like i'm kind of talking about any of the questions she knows none of them so i asked him i got him first question here we go okay okay question number one from savannah did everything ever get to perform her solos from last season would have loved to see i know it's not like a super deep question but we never talked about it yeah no she she didn't so a lot of people like like if their soul is ready they'll take them to early competitions but hers wasn't ready so we didn't take it to an early competition and by the time competitions were starting it was quarantined so she did it but she's super excited for this year she's got some cute awesome stuff but she had a really cute costume maybe i'll show you guys an instagram story or something we would like to thank norton lifelock for sponsoring this portion of the video okay next question so we actually had a bunch of questions about this um and i guess it's because the holidays are right around the corner but it's kind of along the lines of if we ever have gotten hacked or if you've ever had problems with having so many devices um and cyber threats and all that kind of stuff so i'm sure like most of you guys savannah does most of our holiday shopping now online and doing all the holiday shopping online just kind of leads way to the possibility of more cyber threats so with norton 360 it just kind of helps protect ourselves against all that and with new devices so new devices like smartphones and tablets can mean privacy risks the information you think is private may actually be getting exposed hackers can access your devices or steal information send or receive from your new device over wi-fi that's why we recommend norton 360 to help keep your online activities more personal and more secure norton 360 provides multiple layers of protection for your devices and online

on to the next question if you could say anything to your younger self what would you say oh okay so we're gonna say one thing and what what age would i put this at like 10 17 i don't know you know because like younger self like i feel like i would say either like middle school or high school yeah yeah middle school high school stuff right yeah what would you say uh putting on the spot here i would say more be more confident more confident yeah i feel like would you hearing yourself listen like no i don't want to shame any like old friends but i feel like in middle school girls can be really mean you know oh yeah like i'm sure i was mean to some people too but yeah like i just remember middle school girls were mean yeah yeah the guys are mean middle schoolers sucks if you're in middle school it just sucks life gets better than high school like you're in middle school and you're watching this just know i've been there and i feel for you i'll just keep kind of short and simple i i didn't date anybody but i was like always like wanting to meet somebody so like i would just say like don't even like think about it because you're gonna marry the hottest girl in the world anyway so just like have so much fun with your friends and i did but like while i was having fun with my friends i was like oh my future was like i wish i had that mindset out of me yeah so that and then girls be more be more confident thanks again to norton lifelock for sponsoring a portion of this video okay question for maddie did you ever figure out what was wrong with zealand and the nicu if you guys aren't aware zealand was in the nicu when it was first born zealand's fine we don't like guys there is power in prayer because we prayed so much all of our friends prayed all of you guys prayed all of our family prayed we prayed there's just there's no answer firm believer that there was power and prayer and it just went away we were like we called the hospital then we called our they just had no answer and then the hematologist called the hospital again they were like we said i don't know we know we don't really have much for you guys but everything came back fine and unexplained and like an extreme test right that they've never seen before they've never seen this before no they were great oh no no i'm not saying anyway like they've never seen this before and all of a sudden it's just like it's better i know that's what i'm saying like we believe it's prayer yeah so yeah okay but hey all that to say our hospital and our nicu doctors and everybody was the best oh they were we had the best experience so i'm not trying to like bash them in any way the best they were amazing okay from olivia realistically how many kids you think you'll end up having total give a specific number realistically give a number you don't get too many details just like the number that pops through my head just with like me wanting to do foster care and adopt like i know i'm going to adopt a couple kids from foster care i just know it's gonna happen i know something's gonna happen wait what number are you thinking i mean you're gonna take six i think realistically we're gonna end up with six even if they're like spaced out within like 15 years i think we're going to end up with six i think so too that's the first time i've ever heard you say that you just keep maybe two more but we'll for sure adopt either one or two so it's like it goes either way at like six maybe seven but six i'm just kidding i don't want seven yeah but we we really do we love kids we love a big family we know that god has blessed us so much with a big house and maybe not for kids who need it yeah and maybe we'll adopt like or like we'll be fostering a kid and we want to adopt someone that's like 15 when we're older and you know because we're still young because we could be empty nesting by the time we're in our 40s and have a i really do want to adopt an older kid because i feel like older kids don't get then you've forgotten a lot yeah yeah we're on the same page about a lot of things okay from samantha how do you guys find time for prayer and church services with a crazy busy life i i keep it kind of simple you just do that priority yeah just prioritize it yeah you just you just make it a top priority but honestly too like find yourself a church that you love because i would say that we just found a new church that we love like what we've gone for the past two months now and um before that i there was times where i was like oh i don't really want to go today and i wasn't really feeling it and now i'm like up and ready and i want to go and i'm like so excited to go and i leave feeling so much better every time yeah and prayer is just like right throughout the day when you can when you're in your car by yourself i'll pray a lot when i'm like driving to go get everybody from school or driving home from dance when i'm like by myself in the car i'll pray i always pray before bed yeah i i i i used to have a bad problem of like making my main prayer time right before bed and i get sleepy and i groggy with it and i i feel like it would be like a routine yeah dear god i would like pray for this exact same stuff don't make it a routine prayer now i'm trying more to like talk to him i feel like yeah throughout the day yeah the bible says pray without ceasing that doesn't literally mean pray 24 7 it just means pray throughout your day constantly so we're we're working on it we're definitely not perfect we're working on ourselves jensen asked did you wait till marriage if so what boundaries did you put in place i think i think they're mainly talking about like did we wait together yeah because i saw a few questions like like how did you guys wait together obviously but tell marriage but i waited with goal together together we we did you guys yeah so together we did wait until we got married um but it was not easy and we weren't perfect along the way um and we had boundaries that sometimes the boundaries were broken yeah so the boundaries are super important i mean without the boundaries we definitely wouldn't be able to wait until marriage yeah um so definitely just have it like in your head if that's something that that you want to do that you're passionate about yeah that that's just it's just got to be a personal conviction and yeah i think that you want to be something that you want to do uh from coons when real baptized hmm we actually just talked about this yeah i was baptized on an easter service so about it felt like i don't remember the what year it was it was probably when everly was two yeah something i remember seeing like pictures i didn't know then but but honestly i was just talking about this to our pastor the other day because i was like is it wrong to get baptized again like if i've already been baptized like i just don't feel like like obviously i've always believed but i feel like when i got baptized i didn't like change my life at all like it just stayed the same but i was baptized and like yes i believed in him and i was i was brave to get up and go do that at the service but i don't feel like my life overall changed after being baptized so like i would love to start yeah yeah we we both get baptized again together because i got baptized when i was like a lot of our friends want to get baptized too so we might honestly do it with our whole bible study in our pool that's what they told us yeah it'd be super fun but i got baptized when i was 10 years old i know a lot of people get baptized as babies and all that stuff and i'm not saying that any of that's bad yeah but the symbolism behind getting baptized in water is yeah you're the old you is put to death and you're getting raised to life as jesus said so this is a new person so we both want to you know live out that new person that we feel we're ready to live out now yeah that we previously weren't from noah is it true you actually eat 17 pieces of bacon every morning no it says friend fact that's a fact i thought i'd bring in that okay from todd todd mary elizabeth do you ever feel exhausted like you're constantly having to say and do the right thing no no oh that's good sometimes sometimes i i feel like i have like what like i i i think like on online stuff just like like you don't get in trouble i think because we have like such a hyper sensitive yeah you know everything just like cancer culture nowadays yeah i think we have to be more careful for sure yeah we can't put everything out there sadly everyone because but yeah i i think we just had to be more cautious with how with how we say things and what we say in general you know i mean as i think it's wise to do but we're like as real as we can be with you guys without trying to get into trouble yeah from m7 cole when did you know savannah was the one i thought i've talked about this before but like i know we always have new people and this is kind of like an old thing but i think we both knew right away yeah like like honestly like it sounds like cliche days after i met him but we met but like i knew he was the one like eight days i was like this is it yeah i thought i was i actually have a screenshot saved in my phone from when we were texting because like the date was literally like six or seven maybe eight days after we met and she was like i'm all in i know you're my person and i was just like i was in alabama and she was i was like mom and dad i found my wife like i still live with my parents so i was like 90 years old i know it was great it was just it all just went by so fast yeah and i know that it's different for everybody that's how it was for us yeah we're kind of like claire and dale in an annoying way if you watch the bachelor if you watch the bachelorette that's kind of how we were and we were like watching them no hate to them but we were just like ah come on how do you know that they're like hanging out okay i actually have two holiday related questions okay from maddie what is your absolute favorite christmas tradition um as you guys know savannah is freaking obsessed with christmas i am too but you just name one and keep it short can i name a few really fast okay if you can do it so fast if you see them so fast you do a couple okay i really love when we like go get hot chocolate and desserts and we go and look at christmas lights that's like our favorite thing to do we do it like a couple times during december i also really love when we like all make gingerbread houses together and we have a contest and see who went and gets you out you guys help us yeah um and then i like going to like the irvine christmas tree okay that's fun i just like going like i like doing it okay my turn okay i like the mistletoe i don't think about it she's ever actually kissed me on nervousness so actually but i am going to follow that up with i got one emma this is the stickers 20 said when was last time you guys kiss right now yeah like cringy people okay another christmas question okay i'm just curious what is your most favorite christmas present you got on christmas morning it can be anything like recent as a kid think of like opening it chris this morning you've been like no freaking way oh your favorite christmas present ever oh why the first thing that popped into my head was a barbie jeep boom there's your answer i i did get you that last year and you freaked out pretty big no you're really you really i think i was like five years old and i don't remember anything i so remember christmas morning getting a barbecue for the first time i was so excited yeah maybe i could find a picture because i know my mom has a picture and i will put that in here my mine was an ipod touch but i didn't i i grew up in like a family i didn't have like the most money so that's so funny because i don't even like think i ever had enough because i had like the flip samsung i was i i i'm like four years younger than you yeah like i think i got an ipod touch when i was like 13 or 14 years old and man i was like the best christmas ever i was just like oh my gosh i can't believe i cannot believe that my parents got me not when i got you the golf cart that was like the first thing i came to my head the dog part was freaking awesome too yeah that was cool that was an awesome present okay honestly the best christmas present was probably everything that's sweet she came she if you guys didn't know her due date was christmas and she came early she's kind of my christmas present and that kind of leads way for the next question from olivia what's the hardest part of not being everly's biological father so and it's funny because i i feel like i address this enough i feel like i try to address this enough to where i'm not yeah we're doing it but i get so many people saying like i didn't know you weren't at least that and like i just wanna make it clear i'm not everybody's biological dad um she sees her biological dad um the hardest part not being her biological dad cause that's tough to like nail down like one specific thing that's like the hardest part you know yeah i would say like the hardest part was it was kind of whenever i came in um and she was three and a half so it's crazy i've been in her life like four coming up on five years now but because she's almost eight but she was three whenever i came into her life and i was like just the fun boyfriend you know i wasn't anything and then like it transitioned to her like calling me dad and looking at me as a dad figure but because i wasn't there for him that was like that was crazy i feel like for both of us it was crazy because i was young and it happened pretty fast but i feel like the hardest part was just knowing where my boundary was because sometimes i would probably step over it too far and sometimes i probably wouldn't get close enough to it you know i feel like you have a lion as far as like what the perfect dad is like and coming in as like step dad i didn't know okay do i love her full-on as my own kid do i not because i want to be careful with certain boundaries so i would you know always like going back and forth between like how much it's too much how much isn't enough where i need to take a step back and be like hold on that's not my place because i'm not her old dad or maybe like i do need to hit his head on because i want to love her as my own kid so yeah that's a really good job though you guys for real i mean and and and i will be the first to say i am not perfect by any means this is that he does so good but we have some friends who are in similar situations we're blessed to have friends who are in very similar situations and we talk to them about it and so many people struggle with the same thing but i'll say that's the hardest thing especially not having you know two other kids my own and just making sure that i try my absolute best to love her as much as i love the other two kids but also being conscious that she has another dad and that i'm not trying to replace him or anything along those lines um i know a lot of parents step kid says don't have a good relationship so i just wanna make sure that i have a good relationship with her at the end today and her know that she's loved so and she does feel that but it's hard a really really good job it's hard but we we have fun we have fun we have fun together anyways um i bet no one can end the video is that it that's it okay i don't want to answer another question after that how many cheetos did you eat yesterday 47 okay we love you guys thanks for watching this is almost like therapy for us at times so thanks for watching i hope you guys enjoyed as much as we did yeah everything we

take two three hours making this session yeah this took you forever to do last night it's an advent calendar which as you can tell it's like taller than heavily on this wood ladder it's pretty cool all right the battery's dead so you gotta explain it super fast okay so it's like you know numbered one through 24 so they eat so they pick it each day and behind it or sometimes in the bag you know is the like event that we get to do that day so like there's some that are easy that are just like make a gingerbread house and there's some that are like crazy like we have somewhere really fun to go so it's really cool and then sometimes they get little prizes what if i have school wow oh yeah that's why that is the coolest calendar i've ever seen and there's ornaments someday usually i'll just open something and it's back a little like you open it like chocolate chocolate well that's really cool wait i want to buy it i can't believe you made it yourself the thing is you can't peek you can't peek at the events if they're out like this okay you have to keep it secret i wanna i know wow well guys december is gonna be freaking fun bro so everybody what are you gonna do and sometimes it doesn't work because he's busy but i'm gonna call santa why because i'm gonna be the con master of our elves or the codemaster what does that even mean because so i can speak to them and i can see them move and i can tell them where to go what if he says that you can't be the codemaster no he'll blow in the screen so you can be in the codemaster but what if he bought what if he doesn't want you to he he says that anybody can be the codemaster how did you get santa's number in the first place from kaylee from your friend how did she get santa's number um because her mom was the really really really code master how come me and your mom have never gotten the codemaster and we've been alive a lot longer than you we've never even heard about this let us know if you guys have some kind of codemaster thing i've never heard about it i don't think codemaster is going to be happening in the house we'll see calling santa you can't just call up santa whenever you want that boy yeah that boy's busy maybe like one special call i've never heard about just calling up so everybody's number wasn't working but somehow     i want you to know that your family loves you very much so be good and don't forget to always listen to yourself when you hear that sounds kind of like samples a new skateboard a new skateboard and a nerf gun the big one i want to be the co-master of my elves that's all you didn't even say your name how's it going how's he gonna know who it was he doesn't even know what he did he didn't even say your name good job go go go man you are a speed demon you are fast wow she is she is very fast so we are outside this lake you just kind of walk around the lake it's just an easy way to be outside and have fun with the fam so you get a little baby here with us chilling and everybody is officially a skater girl go show us what you got good job posey oh oh it's okay whoa whoa whoa dang look at that   and guys you're not gonna believe this but santa claus the real santa is literally on a boat on this lake right now y'all see him look he's literally riding a boat he's on the other side maybe he'll come closer to us everybody yell for him santa   santa we spotted some some geese oh oh oh they're coming our way hey you be careful okay probably say no goose yeah so we've been on the hunt for santa for a while now i think he stopped riding his boat but i think we see him across the lake on a bench so guys there's some things about california that honestly i don't really like but look at this this is the view of our lake right now mountains in the background oh geese barking all right guys after hours and hours of looking look we found the real santa are you kidding me there's his boat santa claus jose look who is hello merry christmas we're great wow   what did i say but what do you say what do you say oh merry christmas so we had to come back and actually sit down because you can't just walk by santa yeah they got them roped off so you can't really go up and say hey something's going on here because they got a drone with santa which is very interesting what do you think is going on all right so as a lot of you guys know we went to florida for thanksgiving saw some of my family there and uh obviously flying there flying back um we could have been exposed to something so before we go around and potentially see our friends or savannah's family could be coming in town for everyone's birthday next week i'm gonna get a covert test make sure that while we're traveling we didn't pick anything up this is the first time i've ever gotten tested for kofu and i'm a little nervous because i know sometimes they shove it up the brain but obviously i don't want to be exposing anybody i don't have any symptoms but i know that sometimes you can be asymptomatic and i'll show any symptoms so i'm gonna get tested just to make sure that i'm all good before um just going to grocery stores and that kind of thing so a little nervous but here we go i'll be back in 10 minutes appreciate it oh man i asked this one was the one that got way up in your nose and he said nah and then it got way up in my nose oh man wow fingers crossed we're okay okay so i got my test results it took like 10 minutes i was really quickly covered 19 test results your boy's clear so we're assuming that the rest of fame is clear because they're around the same people that i was with and nobody's showing anything so uh okay okay so i have this prank that i've been trying to pull on savannah for a little while now actually we just got back from florida last night um and i have this for sale sign that i put in our yard before we even left for florida so i put it there hoping that she would see it as her pulling out and i had the camera ready she didn't notice it i was hoping that she was gonna notice it whenever we came in it was late last night kind of dark so she didn't even see it then so i'm gonna tell her that we have a bunch of packages by our gate which we really do um and savannah doesn't really want me bringing in the packages because some of them are for me and their christmas presents and she doesn't want me seeing potentially what she got me so i'm out of breath because i'm trying this kind of fast um i'm just gonna say hey babe there's a bunch of packages down by the gate if you want to go grab them and i'm hoping whenever she's grabbing the packages that she'll see this for sale sign i actually got a real for sale sign right in front of her house um i'm hoping i'm hoping that she's gonna ask me about it we casually talk about moving here and there but um we've never seriously talked about it at all it's just kind of for fun um so i feel like she'll be pretty upset that i didn't talk to her about putting up a for sale sign and i'll tell her that i have it listed on zillow and these other house things and that we actually have offers on the house that i've been talking to people and that i actually want to sell the house and just kind of get her reaction so i'm gonna head up tell her we got the packages and maybe she'll notice maybe you won't even notice guys but she sees it she sees the side she sees this she's coming i'm   because i listed our house   in our house yeah why i'm not i'm just checking out the camera did you really listen yeah just to see like what offers we get not not actually sell it just like to see what offers we get what's the point of that well i figured we're gonna be gone for a week a lot of our friends are listening to their houses and just like seeing what they can get you don't just sell it if you list it but we actually have like a lot of people interested because really yeah this i feel like like a lot of people are moving to orange county right now so we actually got a lot of offers i don't know orange county's awesome it's awesome place to live so you just listed the house yeah essentially and where are we getting more print than what we paid so you did just perfect yeah or you actually want to move i mean we casually talk about moving all the time but you know it's always just like wouldn't it be fun if we lived here wouldn't be fun if we were here you know but i thought like maybe it's so weird maybe lister house would not tell me i don't know because i thought if i told you that it was gonna be like big like this is just like very casual like like we don't have to but we actually have some offers that i feel like i wanted to actually talk to you about we need to take it off of whatever it's on because that's weird because we're obviously not going to move right you want to move oh are you filming this because you want to move are you filming this because you're like pranking me or something i want to move   we can move honey so you just put a for sale sign in for the browser no no you put the for sale sign in the yard but then you also list it on like zillow and like all the like all of these other houses actually listen yes the house is listed well let's hit unlisted no that's weird but it's it doesn't do any harm like being listed yeah but like what's the point of like getting someone's hopes up that they can buy our house and then we're not gonna move well i mean just because it's listed people can't be like oh i'm gonna get it like we gotta expect we're actually getting a lot more for it then why don't we take the offer and move what's this vlog turning into um so wait you do or don't want to move i mean if we got like a crazy offer on our house i would definitely move because that'd be silly if we didn't okay we actually have some some really good offers so maybe we can look into it and maybe the vlog we'd have to find a house that has the same or better i was hoping that the vlog maybe same yard yes of course well i was hoping that somebody watching this might be interested in potentially even putting it off around the house or buying it they can live in the uh throw in um the trampoline and the pool you get the pool of the house you don't want that pool it was a great place breaking them right now whatever is great um okay well i didn't access our house it was a joke i knew you're gonna go to new packages i put that thing up there our house is not for sale it was never personal it was never for sale but it could be if you're interested hit us up on instagram and twitter no we

you're good looking no all that's sad honey you are good looking thank you why don't guys put the seat down after the peek um it's just bad habits you know you have to see it though yeah i've never like like i've only fallen in the toilet like a handful of times yeah why do you all play hard to get if you want girls to play hard to get i was so easy to get i don't know do you stay away from me when it's that time of the month i thought this was funny because i literally have had like barely any pain guys yeah i feel like we've said this a few times savannas are pregnant like 80 of our marriage i'm a for real when you when you're when you're pregnant and like what six months after you have the baby you don't have a period yeah so like i've witnessed like 13 periods of savannas yeah that's basically it   okay so savannah's been gone for about an hour now she left an hour ago to go pick up every from school and take everybody to dance um she'll be back in like 10 minutes she's just texting me and i've had this prank that i've been wanting to do on savannah for a while now but i just keep forgetting to do it so she left to go up everly from school taking her dance and she left both babies with me both babies posing zealand are napping right now as you guys might or might not know every has a bunch of super realistic baby dolls this is one of them i want to do this prank where essentially i dress up one of the baby dolls in one of zealand's outfits put a beanie cap on the baby so that it looks essentially just like zealand while i'm holding them and whenever she gets home drop the fake baby and see how savannah reacts so she'll be home like 10 minutes um it looks pretty realistic the only thing is zeal is getting kind of big so i'm afraid that this baby doesn't look realistic enough because like i can actually get the hands that come out so it'll look realistic like the feet just don't reach at all so i think i'm gonna wrap the baby in a blankie and see what it looks like see if it looks more realistic but she'll be holding a minute i'm gonna set the camera up and somehow drop this baby and zeal and posey are both sleeping so don't worry we're out dropping a real baby fake baby prank all my wife fingers crossed she believes it i don't know should be funny here we go here's where zealand actually is though he's just right here in the family room playing with his new toys you big boy yeah you're so happy   um     oh my gosh for a half second you fell for it oh what's your uh what's your head going through right now did you think yeah that you just dropped your baby i okay guys so posey just woke up so we're about to bring her down and do the prank on her see who knows if she's even gonna care or what but do you want to hold the baby you should hold the baby     popcorn   that was funny bye-bye okay you guys are probably tired of seeing me do this by now but um savannah's picking up every from dancing they'll be home many minutes so i'm gonna try and get everybody i'm gonna have the camera right here shoot that doesn't work i gotta find a place with the camera hello   um   hey everyone real quick   is something was happening in your face you were like this are you giving it away when you drop them what do you think she thought it was real for a second it smells like him too well that is his clothes yeah i was waiting here

it on the ace family channel and a few other people's channel where you get a giant bear and you cut the back open and you get inside of like a bear costume and the bear comes to life i feel really bad doing this because it's such a nice bear savannah's mom has like a sewing kit and it'd be super easy just to put this stuff back in and sew them back up don't worry guys barrel will be good as now i'm gonna open them up i'm gonna try and get inside i get hot so easily so i'm afraid i'm gonna get so hot but we just put posey and zealand down and everyone's upstairs chilling uh with savannah

kids   okay you say halfway upstairs yeah no no no oh my gosh look at that girl so so good looking you're weird wow such a good looking lady here look at this lady in my house man smoke show smoke stroller smoke   so savannah and everybody wrap some presents and so our christmas tree's looking legit that's fun but also we got some pretty bummer news for everybody on her birthday it was pretty sad because it literally happened on her birthday like today's the day after her birthday 365 days and it was on her birthday when this happened which is just it's not funny why are you laughing it's not funny but it was just like really today my thing is like i feel like maybe like fan accounts and stuff which is a good thing we're being really nice and like on tick tock we're like doing edits and like posting stuff so it like made tick tock maybe notice everly's account more so because it was on her birthday so people were probably like just doing birthday shout outs and stuff yeah and so she was like they don't even know what she did they don't even know what's happened oh you haven't told them yeah um my account got a band it got banned because she's too young for take talk which we knew but it's like so many little kids have ticked off well and we're not mad about it we're not we're not mad about it in the sense of we we understand why the rules in place we get why younger kids shouldn't be on tick tock we created it knowing that it was kind of risky no no comments super supervised super supervised she didn't have even comments on her account she wasn't even allowed to get on it without us present um that's why we bought a special ipod just for she has her ipod and then the tick tock ipod which we're gonna show you guys like it really was like supervised by her parents like fully and i had that in the bio so i was just like it's kind of a bummer but bummer we understand so she can't it's logged out she can't even log in but she got it all built up she had like such cute tick tocks and i posted a sleepover with my friends and that was like my mom's best video and i loved it yeah it's like a cute sleepover that could have been triggered too because that was the day before it got banned she or something yeah so four four so your fourth video so now we know if you make any tick tock don't post more than three stop at three and then just create i know you take talk and then you do three and then one two three did we try making a new one or maybe we talk about it i don't know if we make a decision yet just because that's it it was so cute yeah or we can make it was fun maybe if like because some of you guys know people maybe if you like know somebody at tick tock and like i mean it's a rule so we're not like trying to like bypass the rules like special privileges because like who we are every single one of our friends has it kicked off and just all of like majority of little kids that's what i think i want to propose the idea and someone's going to take this i was going to say i said this before i was going to propose this so i'm going to take my idea tick tock reach out to me and savannah and everyone and we'll help you guys make a kid talk i think i think that there needs to be a kid tick-tock because kids love to talk but i agree it's not so kid-friendly which is why we didn't even let her on it unless if but so yeah i mean i totally get it but i think how we can get around around it so then she can still have fun and make videos every now and then on it because she loves it so much and so i don't know all of her friends that's like what they do at sleepovers they love making tick tocks together you know i mean she's literally just like she's like listening but i think what we can do is that i can make a tick tock that's me and her so it has both of our names in it i just want people thinking oh she had to have her mom have a tick tock with her i just know that if he is in savannah i have to beg savannah to make tech talks with me like i mean if you go to our pages we make like one tick tock a month maybe we're like the worst tick tockers ever but even that that one's like i'm like babe come on we gotta make a tick tock like come on we gotta we gotta be influenced because we're gonna be active so it would not be savannah trying to steal the show but i feel like that could be our way to like get around it as if i'm into takeoff but then obviously it'll be mainly everlasting but say hi to fans anyone so that's like going away oh yeah it was a bummer it happened on her birthday sorry yeah she still had a great birthday but it was a bummer yeah she was not she's kind of over it now but she was actually really sad yesterday so but it's okay you're so awesome and you're eight you're officially eight now so you know maybe they won't maybe they banged you because you're seven like just and now you're eight now so it's like you know kids talk that's what we want what kid tick-tock alright guys well if you

dollars as long as she doesn't get here don't get five thousand five thousand two hundred okay that's good hey guys there's still five thousand dollars on the board look you could have two dollars ten dollars fifty dollars or 175 400 or 5 000. i will give you each 100 for your cup oh that's good because you could get a hundred or you could get 50 10 or two i'll give you one hundred dollars you take the chance that you might have the five thousand or four hundred dollars you get i'm gonna keep mine you give me your cup and i'll give you a hundred bucks i'm gonna keep mine i'm gonna what if mine's two bucks under here oh one of yours like think about it if what if you what if you open five thousand dollars under one of these this next round then the most you could one would be 400 i'm gonna be offering you like no dollars a hundred dollars this is probably your highest offer no deal no deals number 25 do you know this one i don't i really don't wow okay guys so here's what our board's looking like you have 50 175 405 000 okay wow you guys are just gonna see what it is 50 bucks that's good that's heartbreaking guys it always happens at the end like that they got rid of the smallest and the biggest which that's not what i wanted to pay somebody so now here's the two dollar amounts left that means that one of your cups has 400 and one of them has 175 so you guys don't know but listen you you guys don't know what you have so i will offer you each 250 dollars for your cup because one of you guys gonna have 175 250 each you're good you're gonna be sad if it's 175. even though that's a lot you'll do it for sure for sure 250 each 250 each yeah okay you gotta shake my hand on the deal now you guys don't have to both do it savannah can do it and you can say no deal if you want but whoever wants to take 250 right now shake my hand so shake my hand if you want 250. yeah five seconds five four 250 bucks okay 250 well i don't know she looks pretty nervous she just shook on it 250 for you or no okay no deal no i don't know okay let's see if everything you can do it 250 oh wow 250 for both uh you guys both took 250 wow okay let's see what savannah let's see whatever we had everly you made a bad deal we had 400 i'm sorry yeah psych 175 yes savannah made a bad deal savannah had 400 bucks all right and there you have it there you have it guys at home deal or no deal   okay guys next scene um i'm not wearing my wedding ring i haven't been for almost a year now isn't that crazy i know it's better it's almost here how sad is that like right hand left hand and uh obviously a lot of you guys have noticed just because i literally go back in all of our vlogs past year i just haven't had a ring on my finger um so we just need to clear the air because there's a lot of speculation and a lot of questions and a lot of questions and a lot of stuff and uh dms a lot of dms obviously you guys can comment on youtube videos but just a lot on instagram and other stuff so i figured that we would address it and long story short is um i haven't wearing a ring just because i don't i don't like savannah i'm sorry i'm not saying that i love you sweetheart so you kind of cut me off guard i'm like wait um no i mean obviously i know that anybody can think anything whenever i'm not wearing a wedding ring but um he actually just lost it at the gym yeah i lost at the gym but right before cove it happened i didn't know my ring size so like it probably looked so weird that he wasn't wearing it for so long but honestly we're just if we're being super honest we're just we just like so forgot to go get him one and we're just being super lazy we're so lazy we were being so lazy so we didn't know what ring size he was and so then shark boy right now we didn't know what ring size he was and then so we had to go in to his ring size and then covet happened so then we couldn't even go to the mall we couldn't get his ring size and then we just like it's so dumb just stop we just like totally forgot about it it's also dumb i'm sure like like the title and thumbnail of this video having so many people like but we have had like a lot of people like like just like wondering why i like and like a few people like actually genuinely concerned so figured like we never did address it just because it wasn't a big deal to us because like we're married and like we're just lazy and we knew i was going to get a ring eventually just the longer it went on the more like normal it became but yeah but i got him one for christmas um i got him like a really cool one for christmas i was gonna get i don't even know how she got me surprised i'm gonna give it to him for christmas and then coveted all the delayed shipping and stuff it won't even be here for like another week and it's so it's like mid-january gonna come but i will have one but i was supposed to give it to him for christmas presents i was so mad and i don't even know what it is i'm like kind of i'm really sad i'm really sad that i lost the ring that i got on my wedding day because that's like yeah my wedding ring but like it's like new and upgraded the cheapest ring we just got like super fast so like this is probably a little bit nicer which back then was really good like yeah i am hey i'm not knocking those rings i love that ring like i said i wish i had it but like this one's like a little bit of an upgrade so i'm looking forward to it and i don't know i don't know what it is i just i i finally went in and got my ring size and i said you pick it out whatever whatever you want me to wear for hopefully and when you're okay i'm saying that like i'm saying hopefully there's my life and that hopefully i don't lose it again at least you didn't lose like a 5 000 lower ring yeah it would have been a little more sad about that yeah that would have been that would have been more bummer financially wise this is still bummer just nostalgia and yeah stuff but you're gonna like this new one so we have to show them once okay you get it well i feel i'm happy that we did that but i'm so kind of dumb just in the like i'm just like i lost my ring that's that's why i'm not wearing it you did i know but it's just like i feel like you guys were expecting like something like like semi juicy we don't like each other like just like anything i don't know something no no never never ever ever so stupid okay guys well that's in this video if you liked it you can give this video a thumbs up if you want to or you can give it a thumbs down we wanted to thank you guys come back come back

like her first two first time riding a bike like everything is on this youtube channel and she gets to go back and watch it like i'm i'm like so jealous of that because i asked my mom for videos of me all the time and she like barely has anything at all like i think that'll be i don't even know if i have any pic like pictures of me that you can barely have pictures i love my parents but it is i just think that's so cool like everybody will get to show her husband and her future kids like so many home videos of her when she was little i mean and posey and sailing but i was talking to him

matching tattoos i was like the whole point of going in okay for real so you guys it is funny we just did we just like looked at a cliffhanger uh-huh people were probably like wait what's we went in and i was signing the ipad and then it says are you pregnant or nursing and i was like oh no like i didn't even realize that you can't get a tattoo when you're drinking i'm not oh okay you're not pregnant i'm not pregnant but i'm breastfeeding zealand so i was like oh i didn't think about it yeah yeah i know no yeah i was so sad because you're like so dead set on it so ready i'm so excited you're so ready i know but i'm so excited i even know where i'm gonna put it i'm gonna do the same font and same i was like so ready to go you guys and then i saw that and i was like oh my gosh so i can't even like i'm gonna go get it and you guys will see in a vlog we'll upload it but um i can't do it for at least seven months because i know i'm gonna breastfeed him until or maybe maybe a little earlier it's between five to seven months but about i'm gonna get it but i'm the more committed one in this relationship because kabue it's so cute i love it it's like kind of risen it's like a scabbing but sweet we just swapped sides of the table because it's better lighting over here so so so i'm gonna get the tattoo you guys um but also we like doing these like sit down talking to you guys videos because we're i feel like lately we're getting like lots of questions just like random questions that come into our dm's and i'm starting to like read some of them a lot of you guys have asked where is everly's birth video which like at first i was like that's funny like back then like i didn't vlog so i why would i have a birth video but then i started thinking about it and i was like my mom actually videoed my whole birth with everly and she has it on her ipad but you guys so can we can you show it can we do a live reaction i i don't think so so i i should call my i'll maybe i'll call my mom right now and just so you guys can hear what she says but so i'm pretty sure that her video was literally by the doctor's head like looking up so as you guys can imagine it wouldn't be that beautiful of a video it was a pg-13 conversation yeah it wouldn't be like the videos that you guys have seen of posey and zealand it would literally be gross they're not it's not censored yeah it's not censored but like it was beautiful but not from my mom's angle so um and my mom was in the room so in the room it was me my mom my sister and then tommy who was everly's biological dad um and nobody like videoed stuff then so it's just like we i like i have pictures but like i don't even have that many pictures i feel like like i just have like that one of her on my chest when she came out and that's like it like yeah it was just even like eight years ago it was just a lot different than it is now so i have the ipad video i thought it'd be kind of funny to call my mom and like ask her if we could put it on the vlog like just being funny just to see what she says because she knows what it looks like she asked me if i wanted to re-watch it because she re-watched it like a couple years ago i think and i was like no i do not want to see that here i'm going to call it caller and see see what she says saying we want to put in a vlog hello hi hi what's up um okay so you know how we obviously found like posey's birth and then we filmed zealand's birth um and they're really special videos i know that you filmed everly i thought it'd be really cute if we made a video like on everly's birth story and we can like show the whole video that you got   um i don't think you would want to use that okay that was that that's what i was hoping that you you would say because i was i'm telling the vlog right now how we literally cannot show it because it's from the worst angle possible but yeah well i haven't been smart enough to film from the same angle but cole did like chica and i were actually watching from the other angles where you might not want that film i haven't even watched it have you re-watched it though you said right um i haven't in like three years but i do have it oh gosh all right maybe sometime in a video we'll show my reaction to me watching the video for the first time for the first time all right well thanks all right bye i just wanted to tell you guys oh god to show you guys that i wasn't lying i got a wedding ring oh and you got a wedding ring i know you said a few videos back it said you should take it off whoa that kind of comes off real easy yeah it's like matt is it is that matt matte and it's hammered i don't know if you can see it oh cause you're holding it like this you gotta go like that oh there you go it's pretty cool it's like a this is exactly what i wanted guys it's like hammered matte gold it's awesome and now we're officially married we can't show you everly's birth vlog because i think they get it i think i get it um but it was beautiful and special and   i wouldn't change it for anything even not having a video of it but yeah we just had to tell you guys because i've literally got like 200 dms of like can we should see everly's birth video like i can't show that sorry so everly just came down here and she wanted to know what we were sitting here like formally talking about so i was gonna tell her we were getting a lot of questions like on our instagram of why or where your birth video is because you know how posey and see them both have like a video of them being born everyone's like where's ever ladies like everyone wants to see yours but i had to explain to them that gigi did it on her ipad and she didn't get it from the angle that your dad was at she got it from the other angle so they can't see that everybody's obviously never seen it but i don't even know if i'm gonna show it to everly anytime soon because first of all she's eight so you would want to see it one day maybe when you're older i don't know maybe when like you have your own kids and it's not like most gross anymore then you want to see it yeah my own kids that's how long it is but yeah so that's where we're filming that's in the video so if you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up subscribe share subscribe and turn on post notifications if you want so i feel like i said that every video gets monotonous but hey

spin for me let me see you spin can you sing a princess song for me sing a princess song we're finally doing a family photo shoot after a while guys here's a tattoo it's looking pretty good if you all been following got tatted honey on me me and savannah called each other honey she's my honey honey doing a photo shoot upstairs am i hiding them upstairs is that where you were in for the photo shoot yeah i thought this one was good yeah i don't know if i like that but i mean i like it in general but wow it's getting so good walking the stairs literally dealing you looking like a little stud whoa she's everybody's ready i gotta go get everything's like all feathered up oh oh everybody give you your spin you gotta do your spin     whoa posey what you got you got mommy's shoes wow those look good baby girl so this is the room that we turned into the photo shoot room as you can see we just kind of shoved all of our crud and uh in this corner but yeah it's okay   when you're all done with the photo shoot nice all right what's going on over here bozos well i believe it's dancing and i thought it would be fun to predict predict what was that   okay for a second i thought that we were getting spied on her okay but we're good that noise went away okay so i thought it'd be fun if we predict our next gender our next baby's gender but do you have something to tell us no no i don't you you look this way and you look that way why'd you do that you i got a little you like did this and that because i'm not oh you're not pregnant no oh well then this is clickbait no we're predicting our next baby's gender oh but you oh you can do it even if you're not pregnant yes how so you there's a thing called the ring test when you use your ring and it's like an old wives tale but it's worked for like so many people i know and even some of my friends and keep going thanks honey um i know that we've done this thanks honey thanks honey thank you so much we've done this in the past once and i totally forget what it said i know that it said girl girl yeah i don't remember what's after that but it said that we were having like way more after the girls and i don't remember if it's a boy so do you need to see if it's right so what it does is you put it you get a string so i'll have to take a string i can't remember i think it's a girl girl boy girl what was that it's it's can you just explain what that's going on yeah somebody explained to me what that noise explain what that's going on no i meant like just this actually said i think it said girl girl boy girl i i think i just remembered that oh okay good good um let's see that but i think that i think that it said we were having five kids last time but i could be wrong i don't know we're just going to redo it we're just going to redo it too many kids that's a lot of kids if you guys remember like a while ago and i don't remember which one it was but i had to take a strand of my own hair okay now remember you do have one row of extensions in so make sure that it's not extension here well i only have half a row except oh got me you got me half a row but uh it's got to be from the scalp   make sure you feel like a pen frame you get it do you know which way it has to spin for it to be a boy or a girl yeah at like one of our last bible studies so uh savannah and all of her girlfriends did this for like three hours straight it's actually really creepy because the ring will just stop when it's all done so that that means like you're done with kids but when it first starts it'll like either go circle is so it's going to do circle and then it'll stop and then it'll start doing another one so if it like kind of slows down and then it starts doing circle again that means the same gender oh my gosh that noise has got so it's freaking me out okay i'm gonna find out if um back and forth is boy or if circle's boy so hang on guys let's look how artsy this shot is this my uh my wedding ring that's so cool okay keep going i'll just turn off the rings circle circle means boy back and forth means girl so when i'm gonna first start i have to like go all around my hand and then i'll place it on the top of my hand and it'll start so it'll either start going circle or back and forth and you'll see it slow down but it it's this isn't for the next kid and this is for like the first kid yes my first one should say it should say back and forth that it should slow down do back and forth again slow down circle and then the next one will tell us so okay so if it doesn't even do the three that we already have yeah then it's wrong and we know it's wrong okay if it does i'm not gonna move my hand i don't want you guys thinking i'm like moving my hand to make it like that this thing is actually creepy and it really does it does work i've seen it work i'm like super skeptic about all this stuff so i'm gonna be watching her and i'm a little skeptical of it too but it's work okay okay just do it just do it okay let's do it so this is what we do yeah ready yep i'm watching go all the way around all the fingers and back okay look i'm watching guys i'm trying to get out of her hand to prove that she's not doing anything you're still right guys look at that okay that's everly oh that actually is back and forth big time and look her hands aren't moving at all that's pretty accurate that's pretty cool so it should stop already it should do something back and forth oh it definitely picked up steam there   hmm slowing down oh my gosh wait what the heck you guys i'm not moving my hand circle brazilian it's right now so right now a should i stop it no should i stop it hang on but we're only having four kids right no hang on it'll tell us hang on slowing down case now it'll do something   boy holy that's a circle five kids please stop that's a big boy look i think i think it's swinging i don't know if that camera could tell that was big circles okay it's done it's done look at that that's weird how creepy is that you guys i did not move my hand i kept my hand still the entire time   guys that's so we're gonna have a girl next and then a boy to finish off our family five   is it counting the babies that i have yeah from my belly or is it counting all of my kids yeah i don't know i don't know wow that's pretty cool though like but the next so the next one is that a girl it's a girl and then five boy and then done i'm thinking that it would include an option because because we want to we want to we want to adopt and we've always said that we would probably adopt a little boy did you rip a hair out of your head guys we do shout outs in just about every video just follow us right here and you can be next year shout out we're shouting out people followed us in the last video let's see i'm just gonna like randomly like scroll and tap on one okay who do you have okay this girl her name is liz and it's the four rewind yeah dot you're gonna say card making you say

i'm gonna put a link at the top of our description box if you're interested be sure to check it out so this is lebrantfit and we created this program with our trainer katie and we're so excited about this there's essentially two main goals it's just to have a lot of fun and to get in shape   these workouts are only 20 minutes it's not like you have to leave your house go to the gym come back which can take up to two hours um you can literally just put it on and every single workout is something different it's hitting it all and we are so excited to work out with you guys you're gonna see results just in so many different areas physically emotionally mentally so yeah stick at it all right okay we're doing it we're doing it maybe one of the stupidest things we've ever done not excited about this it's going to be so embarrassing so guys here's a hint of what's going on you see some of these words so we get to make up what each other say we'll explain we'll explain this in a second guys we're about to do something that could be really stupid we're fun like like most of our videos this is like a trend i feel like a year ago or something i didn't even know this was a trend he just brought this up i kind of i kind of stayed with dated on the youtube stuff savannah doesn't really but um you guys might know there was a train where it was like youtubers dm celebrities and essentially see like who writes back so like a bunch of youtubers like dm and like taylor swift and justin bieber and the jenners and all that kind of stuff we're going to do this but with tick-tock stars and how this goes is we have all the biggest hiccup stars in a bowl here so we're going to randomly pull out one at a time oh and i feel like it's funny because like the trend was mainly done by like teenagers so we're going to randomly pull out who we have to dm and then after we pull who you can tell we're not prepared because we just have like pots and pans we're doing it in our pot that i make our pasta and then in here just random words just random words you have to incorporate that random word in the message that you send them yeah brett r rivera oh i know that is rivera all right he's the first one so probably gonna see it probably that's so awkward i think oh my gosh here glue is like pretty close to us and we've made some videos together nail salon nail salon so you have to send brent rivera something about a nail salon a message here's a send brent rivera message something about nail salon okay so awkward hey brent was wondering if you wanted to go to the nail salon soon   i said it said hey i was wondering if you wanted to go to the nail salon so guys we're going to keep these up we're literally filming this tuesday night-ish you guys can see so i don't have to show them right like i actually said yeah yeah yeah no they can't see we'll keep this message sent all night all morning and hopefully some people respond because who'd you get i got dick dixie oh that's so awkward amelia what do you have to say oh it's awesome all right we got like the two most offered people for each other to get like it wouldn't have been awkward if i got her and you got bread i know i know i got something like i got the guys and you got the girls okay i gotta send dixie to emilio something about what does this say doc mc7 hey dixie not sure if you'll see this but my kids are a huge fan   and thought you would appreciate that because they love you too oh man this is good this is so dumb okay   bella poach bella poach who's that it's a girl granite countertops granite savannah wrote half of these no those savannah wrote like almost granite yeah this is so random counter jobs okay i think it's um not quite as weird whenever it's it's a girl bella random question but do you have a grand countertop descend so yeah that's that's as good as you're going to get you she's going to respond back saying like yes or no and you're like okay cool thanks yeah okay okay we got a lot more than we got to get to let's see here we go i got a little ball oh that's awkward he's not really a tick tocker but i figured i'd do a man just like everybody kind of knows who he is okay logan and i low-key dm sometimes that pokemon stuff so that's awkward this wouldn't be like the first time that mixing bowl span like i said you should ask him if you could borrow his mixing bowl hey bro hey bro my my wife can't find our mixing bowl right now do you think do you think i could come grab one and borrow for one from you can't borrow your mixing bowl yeah that's good yeah one from you i'm gonna say tonight can i come over tonight and pick it up can we drive two hours and borrow your mixing bowl and then we'll drive back i'm pretty sure he's gonna respond but maybe not maybe nobody's gonna respond it's gonna be like that much nobody responds i think that's the most awkward one because you actually know him and it's so stupid if nobody responds and it's just like that much more it's already embarrassing which is like that more stupid nobody responds like please just like respond back like sarcastically guys addison addison ray madison a big dog right here oh no we're gonna say addison you guys have never talked before right no flower based flowers the first one that's like that's like the stupidest one that i wrote that's like savannah's like go-to like stupid me and madison like joke about it flower vase hey girl i saw a cute flower baby in one of your stories and was wondering where you got it from that's pretty good yeah that's that's that's not

more time with them and then everly and i will fly up in the morning um and everyone's gonna stay with gigi and i was gonna go up but we thought it was kind of needed for me to everly me and everybody to have some bonding time together because we don't get much one-on-one time just with her busy schedule so in reality i'm gonna drop her off at school in an hour and then after school she has her mandatory dancing for several hours but we'll still get some one-on-one time tonight and maybe watch a movie and just hang out because we don't get to do that near as much as we'd like to so it's needed so we made sure that we made that possible so that's why we're splitting up the way that we are and um we'll fly up tomorrow morning and reunite with them and it's just a short trip we're literally just there for the weekend so we'll come back once the weekend's over but yeah looking forward okay so i just picked up everly from school and you need your medicine and dropping her off right away at dan's house school good good yeah good it's a friday so it's the weekend which is always fun and we're going to san francisco tomorrow morning so that'd be fun but um usually she doesn't

woke up like 45 minutes ago should walk upstairs yes we'll go downstairs we started it which is like we cuddle in the bed with babies because they wake up pretty early and usually feed the baby baby and then posey will get off the bed she'll go wake up her sister it's pretty cute and then everybody got ready for school and then everybody just walked downstairs so we're gonna go upstairs i'm gonna start making everybody's lunch pretty much the very first thing in the morning but this is just like a very like typical day in the life of me so you guys just get to see everything in my perspective nothing too fancy we still got some christmas decorations here that we're hoping to send out the storage soon but other than that the house is all packed up for christmas yeah everly is wonderful making her own breakfast but usually i make her breakfast she just kind of came down a little bit earlier today do you guys want me to make you those pancakes yes yeah first thing posey has is chocolate milk she had to remind you no hang on emily you gotta get the chocolate oh he's like uh mom what are we doing chocolate no i got a little z guy he's usually pretty content because savannah fed him like 6 30 this morning so he's fed he's happy i'll probably put him like one of his little bouncers because he likes bouncing on days where i was surprised that she was making cereal some days where it's like really fast and we're kind of running late she'll make it surreal but we have lots of times all right you want regular or chocolate chocolate pancakes and guys look this is pogey's hair every night she twirls it i think we've shown this off before but yeah let's show how we get those out she twirls her hair so we always have to slowly untwirl it because if you don't untwirl them they turn like huge knots it really is a part of my morning routine watch this i have to do this every morning because she has so many knots in her hair let's see if i can have to go through her hair and i'm not her hair otherwise if you go like two or three days without doing this it just turns into giant like a giant nest look look right here here's another one and so you have to like find the perfect way how to twist it out because you twist it   that's a delicious breakfast these two are starting to play so much and it's so cute yes yes you got your chocolate milk there you go look you could dip there's syrup in there okay   you can go like this yes chocolate dip it in like you can see that you can password your food okay usually she just uses her fingers okay posey what do you think what do you say to mama you're welcome we got our vitamin station over here that we try to stay on top of most days so got some probiotics vitamin d vitamins we really didn't do this much prior to uh kovid but like the start of covered we knew that like yeah i think everybody kind of had with people had vitamins but i would say we probably like them once a month no whatever we probably take them like two to three times a week we just like would forget them all the time now i'm like pretty good about remember them every single day and honestly knock on wood we have not gotten near as sick as we used to vitamin d healthy fruitcake you like it ready okay you could take you can finish it she's like mom i got pancakes you can finish your bite first does a very good job with all the vitamins oh my goodness that's a good morning vitamin for a kid nice we need to give this a baby baby too you do yeah i just got these probiotic drops yesterday that's kind of fun so all the kids are content and then savannah makes the cake so last night i made like a chicken parmesan pasta so then i saved it all so then i can use it for lunch so i believe we usually have it for lunch the next day cola have for lunch the next day yes that stuff is so good and guys it's made with chickpeas chickpea pasta so like gluten-free yeah it's gluten-free kind of i mean we're kind of healthier three but

wanted to share um something i've been doing lately that i love it's i've been doing it on my phone just with the bible app and i've been doing the plan it's like the one year plan so you read the whole bible in one year and it is super cool because oh there's my cute family look how cute   all right one sec i'm telling them about something hi cute boys smiling so big hi so i've been doing the bible app and i've been doing the bible in one year it looks like this okay so see how it says january 28th right there so i'm two days behind right now um but it's really cool it like keeps you on a like a little list on a checklist for um and it's just it keeps you like intrigued and so right now it's taking me through psalms matthew genesis proverbs um and it just kind of takes you all over but like it's just really awesome i love it and it's like keeping me super intrigued and into it and i've never been into my bible like i am right now like i'm just like all about it i want to like every time i get like a free moment i want to like sit down and read the bible and so sometimes when the kids are napping in the morning i'll get a chance to do that um and it's just been really good for me

picked up some lottery tickets we've never done a lottery tickets before together um but i just thought it would be fun what she doesn't know is that one of these this one right here can get a mix up this one right here is a fake lottery ticket this one is a fake ticket that will win one million dollars i'm gonna give this to her at the end and see her reaction i really don't think that she'll uh expect it coming um she's never done lottery tickets me and my family grew up doing them in alabama and florida we did them all the time you usually don't win all of these are real these are real tickets this is a fake one and it looks just like these so she'll be down any minute i don't think everybody's coming but maybe she is i'm not sure but either way it should be a lot of fun here we go       you ready yeah are you watching the show yeah do you want to do these first or do you want to do them after what are these a lot of research let's do them does everything go on yeah should we go to bed you wanna do some lottery tickets with us yeah yeah okay have you guys ever done a lot of your tickets before no i've never been watering before okay they're pretty easy all you do is you scratch them off and you'll see all the tickets are pretty much the same rules you have numbers at the top that you scratch if you match the numbers to the numbers at the bottom you win money   this is a 30 card these three are 30 cards and you can win up to a million dollars oh i i have one you have one match 3131. so you see it says 3131 so you get a free ticket so you can take this in and get another water material for it that's cool so so next family lottery night so hang on so this is the million dollars all versus the exact same you have the numbers at the top and you want to match the numbers on them okay i have a six oh oh i have two of them so far wow it's a million dollars this could be you're probably like 100 bucks at the bottom i mean if you get all of them which is like impossible you can win a million but the more you get the more money you get i got seven oh wow 27 6287 how many went over there one two three four five six more numbers though that's still pretty good though i mean i'm three or ten you have to get your money back look i got i got the 50. crap oh wow keep going you got it does that really mean that much money i don't know or that number i don't know or do you have to have like multiple of it well you still gotta try it a little more so wait what are you looking for now   did you make on yours i   look i have the 27 i have the six seven six i have the 28 28 i have the seven seven the thirty six 22 36 yes i do oh 36 wow wait you have 22 yeah okay now i just need now i just need a 32. 33. i need the last two i need i think if you do a 32-56 and you win a million dollars no wait there's bonus though see there's this and you have all the bonuses right yeah but even if i have all these the prizes are still like 500 000. just scratch it just scratch it because it's always those last ones   that's all you have to do is just have those numbers yeah but it's like wait what does this mean no way okay you're gonna see if you get   32.56 oh my

time she gets home what she just did she just got baby z hey we just woke up now we're waiting on posie no wait i'm posing and some family hangs but something funny is actually posey he's like at an age now where she's like so good at climbing i was actually telling somebody that yesterday back in our movie room we have like a bunch of like what are they called like bean bags like all over the place and she just like dies like flips and like she's just like a psycho person um kind of like that he really likes my sister's home because because it's friday so pretty much tuesday wednesday thursday i have to go straight from school to dance and then these babies are pretty much asleep by the time she gets home so it's almost like i know three days it's like a competition season for dance so yeah it's about to get busy well we're going to uh nevada yeah we're going to reno we have her first competition in what two weeks two weeks two weeks are you ready dude yeah we used to film a lot more dance stuff we haven't done anything in a while so should be cool i left the baseball pj's buddy what the heck is this oh my slime wait what is this it makes all my slime sticks you mix all of your slimes yes how many slimes is that a lot holy moly that's a that's like a giant wad of bubblegum so heavy it is pretty heavy what do you think about that oh it's actually not like bad slime like it's not like too sticky which i like i figured if you mix all your slime together you'd be like really bad slime it's pretty signs are just really colorful here catch it ready i'm gonna throw it to you okay okay i'll try ready all right here all right here it comes oh i'm gonna throw this watch this one two three gotta catch it oh one two three okay okay come on you can catch it one two three so if you remember everybody actually got slime stuck in your ear like six months ago or something you remember that with avery slime yeah by throwing slime so maybe we should throw that because you could you imagine if this got stuck in your hair it's not sticky though it's not but all slime is kind of sticky and this could definitely get stuck in here so be careful like in your hair oppose his hair hey step on it with your feet step on it step on it all right so i'm gonna hold this in and you hold that in and we're gonna stretch it okay okay ready it's gonna be nice and slow oh it's just gonna sink it's just gonna sink ah that's a lot of slime though it's pretty cool pretty cool well if you guys want to buy i had i've mixed all my tiny slimes and then i had a big flame that i already mixed so i mixed it in and it turned huge yeah that's pretty big so i was taking the trash out um it's friday night and i came out to this i'm gonna show you guys i haven't shown savannah yet i came out took the trash out saw this around the corner walked up my front door saw this went and grabbed the flashlight to see how bad it really is and i'm gonna show you guys and then i'll show savannah um this has never happened before at least to us we got tepee'd this box has been out here for a little while so i don't mind that but other than the box um our like whole house i got everything very front of the house oh down the side of the house guys literally got our cars both cars all in the trees i don't know how much you guys can see but literally all up in the trees which is nuts guys here's our fountain like i'm gonna zoom in here for you so you can see how bad it really is it's like all in the bushes all intertwined all getting wet from the fountain all just over little pieces everywhere in the driveway um i mean it goes all the way down like they got it up on top of our house all the way down can you guys see that like literally all the way down the gate on the gate by the basketball goal on this side this fence all the way down the bushes so i'm not sure did this um i don't think that whoever did this obviously probably didn't know that we have security cameras security cameras so whoever did it um we have certain security cameras lined up all throughout the front all throughout the garage all throughout the front of the gate so um i'm gonna go bring savannah out and i'm hoping it was friendly i'm hoping it was one of our friends but if not um we'll look at our security cameras and find out so fingers crossed it was somebody we know   hello happy friday night hi you guys wanna come out here for a second sure she's like kind of busy you guys might just want to see what happened to the front of her house you don't have to but i feel like you might want to why just come look this isn't like some like prank that i pulled yeah come on this way this way slow your rolls are you walking faster than me slow down i want to get your reaction hold on what i know okay this is like this is like what used to happen to me in like fourth grade i know we got freaking teepee i'm so confused because the gates closed so i had it had to have been obviously something that well i don't think it has to be somebody that we know yeah because they have to know the gatekeeper yeah but like look it's everywhere it's in the bushes here i need i need to go here i'll go around oh cool i know here i'm gonna grab my flashlight   that's our neighbors it was kaylee haley   who was it who was it kyle and mad well i told i told the vlog that we have security cameras everywhere so we can just look at the cameras and see who did it yeah that's so true but yeah it's not funny i didn't even think of that out here that was my very first thought i mean i'm just mad because we gotta freaking clean it up really i used to like keep you like people like this all the time when i was your age not me probably not all the time when i'm serious okay middle what are you influencing her guys actually i guess when i was hurried because i went with my big sister oh my gosh how was her age guys don't tp people's houses first off huge waste of toilet paper everybody's out of here she's going back to play video games okay a lot of things a lot of thoughts here i want to find out who it was they said kyle are mad i think that's probably accurate uh second thing they didn't clean it up so i want to call them and tell them hey come clean this up because two if it stays okay i'm gonna look on the security look on the security thing the morning do the morning do is gonna make it all settle and the trees it's gonna be wet toilet paper all over our grass and stuff and three guys toilet papers are hard to find still this is like such a waste of toilet paper like i feel so bad i want to like i want to like bundle it up and like put it in our house and still use it so does it go away right now i know like this has got to be like one of those huge packs it's like a lot of rolls this is a lot of stuff guys i didn't show it off like too much up close but it's just all over i mean they got our cars back here like they got all over the escalade way back here it's just everywhere i know it was them i mean you can you can look on the security thing but i bet if we called them shout out adt no promo but it was them that was kind of madison yes was it just them two or three they have the twins with them this one's worth okay oh man that's a dead giveaway whenever you see two adults and two little tiny people that's really cool here let's call them the twins are probably so excited let's call them they gotta come clean this yeah they're cleaning up i'm not cleaning this up i don't wanna clean up it's free it's freezing cold right here and it's gonna get wet it's all on our fountain this coyote the twins don't have to imagine put on speakers all i can say is i'm so mad nice one okay hey tell medicine yeah you don't mess with me for the record guys we always call kyler because madison never answers her phone yeah never but it's worth a shot hello madison never answers her phone never do you not realize that i have security cameras why i saw two people that look just like you and kyle and then two little tiny people with you that look kind of like your twin face timer i don't know i want to see the guilt on her face   what are you talking about did you teach me my house what's going on yes it was we have security cameras we have security cameras yes yes kyler let me see your face kyla let me see your face maybe somebody else has gone here no because there's two tiny people with them there's two yeah there's two tiny people that look like twins what there was two tiny little people that look like twins with you with you guys like little kids we've been watching all the night i don't i'm they said they saw you they said that they saw your car skirting out of our driveway and i feel and i feel like we'll probably

this video um this is obviously going to be a little different every video than we usually make uh i don't know how long it'll be i'll try to keep it shorter and not talk too too much but um this is just going to be a super super honest super real video something that we weren't going to make a video about we weren't even going to bring this up at all because we didn't want to make it a big deal we didn't want it to like we just didn't want to make it something bigger than it was   we feel like this is real life and we're sitting here like at really late at night and we're like we should just be able to like yeah i know it's tough to say it it just feels like it's something that works really going through yeah and like i feel like the past few videos like i've been like putting on like this like fake face yeah no not that like i haven't like enjoyed like the happy moments but like i have like off camera but i could always struggle but we feel like we should also just like be really real with you guys like we want you guys to know that like our life isn't always perfect and there are things that come up and like we're normal people at this point i hope you guys know that we aren't just like making a video because no because whatever else like we should be able to make happy videos and happy moments but also when they're able to tell you guys when something is going on yeah so i'll start from the very beginning um cole's always a little more like i'll let you kind of talk a little bit about it but cole's always a little more like stressed out about things with the kids like just like health issues them getting hurt any like anything like it it always stress if it stresses me out like this much it stresses coal out like this much like that's like the big difference of it and i'm already like i would say that i worry about things a good bit too that i've expressed with you guys about but like he like really does to the extreme and it's something he's like really been trying to work through um and we've been praying for him about and he's really trying to just get better about right because it's really starting to eat you up um posy has kind of given us a run with just like hospital being hostage she's been hospitalized three times right yeah like imposes like like first year life she had to go to the er like three three years and not even include the cruise it wasn't even just like she was kind of like kind of sick and we had to go she was like projectile vomiting had to like get an iv like got x-rays it's not like normal sick no like she's she's always like scared us so bad one time was like well one time was in vegas and i was scared because we weren't home um and it was at one of every dance competitions and she had one of her moments where she just started throwing up and like it had a super high fever of like 104 and we were in vegas and we had to like rush her to the emergency room and it was just scary and then another time was here and they like sent us three different places in a wheelchair like going as fast as they can like we literally were like and i'm sure you guys saw on videos we kind of shared a little bit of that but like i don't think we really shared like how much it was stressing us out like we were so scared about posey and we never got answered no so it wasn't like they were like oh this happened because she has this or because of this it was just like they were like oh well we we kept her hydrated keep her hydrated give her tylenol if one of our kid is always a little sick she always gets it like so bad like to be extreme so it's always really stressed cold out especially just like her health in general and we brought it up to the ph our pediatrician like six months ago and he kind of like reassured us that like this can be normal and it's no big deal and even back then i like wanted to get her tested but i i've just always been anxious about specifically her and her health and it's tough for me to explain i'll say even like you have like a little bit of angst not not not a lot nothing compared to me but like i uh i i want to make sure that i say like i don't have like a constant anxiety do where like um like i'll go like a few weeks or even like a couple months or like i would say that i don't really have much anxiety like it'll come like from time to time like most days are fine all of a sudden it'll hit me like a rock and essentially like like this past summer i got hit by a rock and um like i didn't eat for like two weeks straight pretty much and lost like a bunch of weight and didn't sleep over something and xenon was in the nicu even like right after zion got out of the nicu like literally right after zeon got out of the nicu posey got this crazy rational over body which we didn't post or share about because whatever but it was like from head to toe this crazy rash that like no other symptoms we took her to get checked out and i think they like diagnosed as i came from mouth disease but but then another doctor diagnosed it as something he said that it wasn't him for mouth disease so it's like i don't know all in all she got better and this was back in august and she's been pretty good since then um but i guess i'll kind of like start where like the stuff's been happening recently essentially two weeks ago um posey woke up in the middle of the night screaming it was like midnight one o'clock just saying that her leg hurts posey can talk and communicate to us pretty well now um so she just woke up in the middle of the night she was like and she never knows this never mind she's she sleeps like how she had pain in her leg yeah and she was just telling us that her leg curtains like i literally you had to go in there and get her and then i had like walk in there afterward and like double reassure her like we took her downstairs and like she wanted band-aids on her knees like to make them feel better and um we just thought like her legs were hurting but like as soon as she told me that even in the middle of the night like a red flag like went off on my body like like the anxiety instantly hit me like a rock like i think you were just like oh like her it's like let's put it back to sleep with me like the anxiety hit me like a rock like i was like shaking i was in fear because um a kid that i knew growing up um like 10 years ago in my childhood he said that he had leg pain and it ended up being bone cancer and um i the only reason i knew that was because i grew up with that so like as soon as like she said that my leg hurts it triggered this alarm where i go you know my anxiety goes like worst case scenario instead of like and for me i'm like she's fine i'm like kind of but for me like i'm literally like i'm just like worst case scenario kind of person and i didn't know this so i i'm like i tell her i'm like there's this kid that i grew up with he said his leg hurt he got bone cancer and he ended up passing away as well and it was like really traumatic i grew up in a small town like everyone knew this kid and so it was a big deal so then like my anxiety starts making me rationalize like maybe i went through that so like that state of my brain and like now like she's saying this and like dad gut like parent gut like you're supposed to like trust your instincts like there's always been something off so i'm like what if this is all happening like for a reason and honestly like that word just like terrifies me like the word cancer terrifies me like i've had people in my family who've had it i know that so many people watching this everybody's been affected by it and it's just um something like i don't even want to like speak life into that it like terrifies but it like literally i'm sure you guys can hear my voice like it gives me anxiety to even talk about before we keep talking to you posey's fine and she does not have cancer yeah but we are we're we're we're just saying that cold literally i see my anxiety eating him up inside for so long and we wanted we want to share this with you guys just for the pure fact that we want to be real we want you guys to know that like we have struggles too and anxiety is a real thing and um we really just wanted to bring awareness to that yeah and and so that was like two weeks ago so zealand that happened on a friday i i remember it happened on friday and zealand had his pediatrician appointment on tuesday so we called the pediatrician that friday and we're like hey spring posing hey yeah can we get posies checked out you know just get blood work done yeah the pediatrician can't find her veins that tuesday um so we're like great he sends us to a quest agnostics where uh they want to check her veins and savannah savannah's having to do all this because i can't even go because of my anxiety i literally can't even be there sad he was crying i literally can't even be there he had like major tears in his eyes and i could tell he was like so not going to be able to take her to that appointment like i want to be there but like in my head the anxiety is so bad like it's going to be so hard to see her do it it's going to be so hard to think to know why we're doing it yeah and then what if we get the bad news i i won't like i'm going to yeah but but right now they only allow one person yeah and one person thing so it's like either me or you it's a request request they did one arm couldn't find it and they did the next arm and they couldn't find it either so like they poked her a bunch of times but like and we're trying to find it but they couldn't get any blood out so they were like she's dehydrated but i'm like she drink she's the most hydrated two-year-old that i know she's in my brain i'm like no she's not but she drinks a lot of drinks oh yeah she's like like she drinks more than i do but that's besides point they said come back i will they were gonna do it again they were gonna go get someone else and i was like she is so upset like this poor little girl was like so confused she's getting pricked a bunch of times in her arms she's like so she was just so done and she was being so sweet about it she like they like took it out of her arm and she's like thank you she's like the sweetest little thing so it broke my heart but so i'm like okay we're just going to go we'll come back another day because obviously it's just not happening right now like you guys are trying and you guys are doing your best but it's just we'll come back so that was on the that was on friday so friday she said that her later tuesday went to the pediatrician the following friday we're at quest so it's been a week still nothing in between she says that her leg has hurt a few times she'll still mention her like yeah and i think there was one other night time too where she was where she woke up really really and i started noticing i started asking her and it was always her right name so i started thinking like she jumps on the trampoline a lot like maybe we're just thinking way too much into this she dropped on the trampoline she kind of like had a little sprain or a little fracture like something i think that if it wasn't for me you probably wouldn't even thought twice about it yeah really like the fact that i'm bringing this up constantly because of the what-ifs um i think it starts like planting seeds in your head too yeah well which i i get i and i i know that there's like a good side to it like that there can be a healthy amount of parent worry yeah you know but i feel like i take it to like the extreme unhealthy amount where you do the word just like eats me up like i can't even be there for her um so you took her in today which is now tuesday yeah um so however long that is i don't know the exact matter so do that essentially we just called the doctor and they're like okay try chalk if they're if the quest isn't able to find her veins that's not working that's true children's hospital orange county yeah um and so i went into the emergency room today um i told them what's going on i told him about her weird fevers how she was just hospitalized a lot when she was little um and we really have zero explanation for this like we're just all kind of confused like we just kind of want to know what's going on um and i was like her legs really bugging her and they asked me which leg they had her like walk around and hop on her legs and stuff and they were just like shoot i mean she's not limping i'm like i know i'm like but it's to the point of um she's she's really concerned about her leg obviously and i would be this is a like part for me too it's like i would feel so bad if she's telling me all these things i don't do something about it and then it leads to something else you know what i mean like i i wanted to take her seriously so even though they're like well she's not limping her leg feels fine it's not swollen there's nothing wrong with it i'm like i just kind of demanded i was just like i want an x-ray like can we just do an x-ray so then like my husband can sleep and eat like he's just like a nervous wreck about this like so i just need to do an x-ray and i'm like and the doctor already did a blood test so we were going to do the blood test so i just had blood tests and let's do an x-ray so i'm like okay we could do that and they were all super nice um took us back there we spent all day at the hospital it we were there from 10 until three um and so they did the x-ray on her leg and everything came back totally normal which was great um and then did the blood test and everything came back totally normal everything was normal the only thing that they said was her blood count was like a little bit high but like super tiny like just a little bit high which doesn't really mean anything bad so yeah everything came back totally normal and i could totally tell a difference in his behavior from three o'clock till now like he's just like a totally different person literally like from like this morning because like like yesterday was a great day we went i don't know if you guys like falls on instagram like savannah kind of posted we were like downtown disney we were going to take her to the hospital yesterday but i just needed like a break i needed like a fun day like a breather so i went downtown disney walked around and like she didn't bring up her leg one time so i was like maybe you know my anxiety's like messing with me like is it is it the right parent good anxiety or is it like she's not even bringing it up so we did that and so i was waking up this morning hoping that maybe i shouldn't even bring it up and like i could like ignore her but the first thing she says when she gets out of bed is that her knee hurts she's really into like band-aids and boo-boos and just like in general so that's why i was like brushing it off for like nine days i feel like i was just like oh she's just really into doc mcstuffins right now she's really into like just like doctor and people which is honestly what i think it really all comes down to yeah and she's just really into those shows and boo-boos and putting band-aids on her legs and stuff because yeah nothing's wrong but but like whenever she woke up and and i'm always one who gets her out of her bed usually um she woke up at seven and i go to get her and she says dada my leg hurts and she and i go downstairs and she wants me to put a band-aid on it so in my head i'm just like ah i can't ignore this so like we call the hospital and like savannah was like telling me like she wanted me to like face my fear kind of thing and i wanted and and take her but i i couldn't like i physically just like like i told her that i would but she was nice enough to to do that um but like literally i i got to eat breakfast i didn't eat until you guys got back at three o'clock and like i know like i don't want to make this like maybe me like whatever else like as far as the anxiety level of this like i've lost eight pounds the past two weeks which is just goes to show like how little i've been eating and sleeping and and again not for me at all all that we wanted was was good news and i feel like one of the hardest parts for me is like through this so like whenever we got that news obvious like the good news that i had been praying so hard for and and just really working through this fear with it was like such a relief for me because i know that the anxiety was like very situational and like attached to that so it was like such a relief but at the same time i almost didn't feel i felt so relieved but i also still felt the heaviness because i know that so many parents don't get the news that we got yeah you know like i i my anxiety took me to the place to where we got the bad news and my anxiety took me to a month from then and like two years from then and like my anxiety took me to these terrible places that aren't even real um but then my heart still hurt after we got the good news because i know that people actually get that news um and that and it was it was and it is now because it's literally the same day so heavy on my heart um and i know that like i don't even know i i know i'm gonna say all the right words as far as it's tough because i it it's such a heavy heavy subject um but through it all we we've been connected with families who've actually gone through trauma and stuff throughout the years and a lot like followed them on history follow them and you know try to post things for them and about a week ago as i'm going through this and trying to find answers and praying and dealing with my anxiety and trying to you know get answers from posey this uh instagram account comes onto my home feed and i click on it and um i feel like it's assigned to some extent and the instagram account is called positively penelope um i'm gonna link it i've talked with the mom the past week but essentially penelope is a two-year-old girl so posey's age who did get diagnosed with cancer um she has stage four high risk neuroblastoma really we just like felt super led to share this with you guys and put this out there and help this family out because as cole's saying like obviously we have we're super blessed with the news that we got from posey and it could have been anything we're not saying that it could have been cancer it could have been she's anemic like it could have been anything that we with the blood test and she got was totally fine a lot of people don't have that good news and so we really want to bring awareness and try to help out families yeah that don't have that good news and so i asked this mom like is it okay if we share your daughter's story not not anything for our gain whatsoever and i hope that you guys know that and see that simply for they're trying to help raise awareness um help help receive prayers i mean we're if you're not a christian you don't listen to this at all but as people of faith and um as christians i promise you we're praying for this family and this little girl so hard we believe that miracles can still happen um even when all hope seems lost so we are praying so hard first and foremost just for a total miracle in this girl's life um and we hope that you guys join us um like i said i i have this anxiety that like will take me like worst case scenario and i know that this family was hit with worst case scenario news um like i go through the mom's instagram and and she i i asked her how do you want me to tell your daughter's story because this is your daughter's story this is your guy's story like i don't want to say anything and she said go through my instagram and tell her how it's told on my instagram so whenever i go through her instagram you see that her daughter turned two back in june and you can go and you can see that her daughter turned two and you can see and some of the pictures that she has like a little bit she has a little black eye which you wouldn't really think too much of and right after she turned two they went to go get the black guy checked out that's on her post july 2nd and they went into the er to check out what the swollen black eye was and it turned out to be stage four neuroblastoma she's two you know i see her and you know i see my baby you know and i know the innocence i know we only came across this a week ago so i've been like catching up on her family but like the recent post has just it has gotten worse you know and so like i can't even watch this last video i told savannah every time i watch it more time jack tell her because you can see her you can see that her dad's holding her okay and you can just you can hear a voice i love you i said she's too and she doesn't know what's going on such a pretty girl so we're just praying for a family we're praying for when we know that that they aren't the only ones that this is like a thing that's going on all across our country and our world and that there's just like real issues like this and i don't know why i don't know i don't know but we're just praying that that you guys join us in prayer for her specifically we we can't help everybody um i i know that this video is only doing so much help for the family like we're not expecting this to like do anything insane but like if we can help one family if we can help one girl then we gotta see you guys pray first and foremost for a miracle pray for for just peace and pain free in her body because i know that she's on um all sorts of medication to take the pain away um and she's on hospice so that's just not a place that you want to be in and um we're gonna put the go there go fund me um obviously prayer for healing pray to god for for just full deliverance but we're gonna link their gofundme um we've donated you guys though we're probably gonna donate more guys the hospital bills i wanna i wanna i wanna show you guys something if there are there's one million people that watch this video and each person a dollar yeah one dollar is a million dollars so like we aren't asking you to do anything crazy even if just all of you guys did one dollar to this family that's insane yeah that's insane yeah so again we we know that some of you can't give but yes if this story in whatever way touched you um it would it would mean the world to them and like i said we we've never met them it's just i cannot imagine being like i i just i cannot and um if the parents of penelope are watching this just know that we love you guys and you guys are the strongest people in the world i mean nothing nobody compares to what you're going through and um penelope is just literally our hero and we're gonna be following you guys and praying for you guys and i don't know what else to say but that's it that's it that's that's what's been going on we've had heavy hearts and um we just we want to do more good we want to do more good we know that god's given us this platform with youtube and we with you guys and like so much of the journey has been like showcasing like happy a happy fun god loving family who's far from perfect and makes a lot of mistakes along the way but um we want to like do more of this and like things that god puts on our hearts and things that we come across for a reason we don't want to like shy away from out of fear of like people like thinking oh they're doing this for this i don't care what you guys think like there's literally a two-year-old and so many people going through so much pain like if we can help raise awareness and money for them then and who knows maybe even prayer for healing like that's so much more important so thanks for watching um i'm good i'm good i i know like we started this like about me this isn't about me this is about penelope and her family mm-hmm so like just know like i'm good my anxiety was very situational and i mean i'm so grateful for the news that we got like i said my heart's so heavy knowing that so many people don't get that so we want to start helping people who aren't getting that news yeah so that's what we're doing so we don't we don't just want to say and ask you guys to pray for her we're going to stop right now and we want you guys to join us wherever you are watching this video and um we're going to pray for penelope and our family

me to catch like lands there like bounces off the ceiling or the roof doesn't count set go so i couldn't have caught that you hit three tries like usual i could not have cut that i'm ready okay nice i hit my hand i should have caught it but i'm i'm not pro in the nfl but that's one last throw honey   it was kind of close but it just drilled posey's water toy so you got one guys i was there for savannah i walked forward probably like 10 feet forever first throw here we go i'm ready oh oh okay so one more try it's okay technically it hit me but not in the air so savannah got football i don't think football's every sport but she didn't go to the other so it's okay it's okay whoever can go the fastest uphill so you're not just rioting you're actually having to push a skateboard wins will compare the time on your marks get set go eight point eight two seconds all right on your mark get set go oh man you're going pretty slow you're gonna go faster than that don't eat it though oh man sorry we did a beat y'all i stopped like a second late but it was still like 10 seconds so she had you like a full second or two dance all you gotta do is who can see who can do the most turns i gotta make this more competitive i know want to do okay so this final round actually counts for uh three points so so if i get this then whoever wins this is technically the winner so you gotta like really

what do you think you want to try them on so let's just try a pair on let's try one let's just try them on oh they're glasses they're fine look at these glasses yeah let me see can i see i love them they're beautiful babies like them we want a prize where you go baby oh what do we say thank you so guys we gotta get posey glasses which we think is just like the cutest thing in the world so cute because i never had glasses as a kid it's invading the red glasses as a kid well and just like we never expected anything like that because like no family member has glasses at all like on either side yeah nobody needed glasses like until they got older and like their eyes they started going away so like no one's ever had glasses as a kid she's like the first song she the doctor said that she has her vision is is i don't even know the right wording oh i don't sound like an idiot but that her vision is like impaired from far far away and close yeah and it's not bad it wasn't like bad or severe but that's you but she said by age eight fifty percent of kids that have this either don't need glasses after they're eight or they do so it'll just depend if 50 grew out of it so we'll see but either way we're kind of excited for her she's excited for us so it's gonna be so cute cozy girl needs glasses which is gonna be so cute um i ordered them and we're gonna get them next week um but i just realized that we never even told you guys like we kind of just like kept it to ourselves um but now i feel like you guys should know we've she we've been seeing her go cross-eyed for like a few months now just like whenever things would like get really close to her face she'd go cross-eyed and so that's why i made the appointment um and i made the appointment like almost two months ago but they had zero openings like this was the earliest that they could take us in um but yeah so we've been kind of like feeling like glasses could be a possibility just with her going cross side but it was mainly just on like things like close up that we noticed yeah like if she's like on the swing yeah she had cross-eyed or she was like in a day she kind of go cross-eyed so yeah we assumed it was something vision related but but we also were like but there's nobody in our family line that needed glasses or have impairments no we're not like bragging like no we just we just thought that it wasn't there's nothing wrong with glasses like we're excited for we're excited for her so it's going to be fun and cute she's ready everybody's home from school and she just had her valentine's day that's party many valentine's gifts i remember going to school on valentine's day and you got like your valentine for like that special person and i know now you're my special person now you're my special person we

yeah oh oh no oh no is the baby crying he's not really crying but no mommy's gonna cry mommy's gonna cry he's just happy because he doesn't know what's happening so guys xeon's about to go for a nap whenever he wakes up mama's going to be gone for a full 24 hours like 28 hours like for more than like four hours it's your first time leaving him overnight since he was born i feel like because most of you guys know zealand was a nicu baby so i feel like savannah is like super ultra she's always like this with all of our babies but it's like if they even magnify just because of like what they went through together so i convinced savannah to have a night out with her girls for her birthday so her birthday is technically like two weeks but i guess i technically left him two nights in the nicu but it was for like eight hours yeah but that wasn't even really bad i barely said choice that was just doctors were around so this is like your first time willingly leaving him he is so ready he's ready for his nap but i just want to eat saying goodbye to him because this is like a big moment i don't want to cry because guys i have half of my hair straight right now and half of it girl because i just heard it but as you guys know zealand is such a mama's boy like so this they have like a really special bond wow what do you have what is deck is this thing thank you you go daddy yeah she knows you can't have that i think all right all right put them down bye bye baby oh the size of that guy's like no idea he's ruining so sad when you wake me up there's a mess and there's a mess somewhere how you feeling i miss him already are you gonna cry no your voice sounds like yeah like like a crying voice i just feel sad why do you feel sad because i'm gonna be away from my baby you deserve this you haven't left him one night for the past almost seven months he's so little and chunky and cute yeah you're not so much funny you deserve this you deserve a night out with your girlfriends she's obviously like posey and everything before overnight just never zealous that's why i stepped on zealand wow you just have all the cool stuff right now yeah and just so you guys know this is like still like the wrapper on this thing it's not like um it's like a part of it all right my love i guess this is goodbye this is goodbye i love you with my whole heart you're my one and only you're nice for the rest of my life this is so stupid i had an upgrade give me a kiss okay put the camera away i love you guys okay so savannah's officially gone um guys look it's february and we still have rosanna savannah's officially gone but what she doesn't know is we actually have one more surprise is that i'm actually about to leave in 30 minutes um with the husbands of the other wives who are going and us guys we're actually gonna be surprising the girls out there we're having savannah's mom come and uh watch the babies so i think that savannah will be really excited because she isn't expecting it at all she thinks it's just a girls trip when in reality it's a couple's trip um and i think she's gonna be super excited because the whole time she was saying like uh she hasn't left zealand ever obviously i can explain but like if she is going to leave them she would rather like obviously she loves time with her girls like she would love to have me there so she kept asking like why i can't go and that kind of stuff and i was just saying it's good for you just to get away and have a girls trip just just girl time which is good they're going to have that as well but um i think she'll be really excited that uh i'm showing up and obviously the other girls husbands are showing them too so we're surprised she has no idea i won't vlog any of that but um i thought i'll let you guys know in case you see anything so um that's happening and uh should be fun i'm sad too because this is my first time ever leaving zealand um but i gotta go pack i gotta go get ready i haven't even showered i gotta go shower get ready and um i'm kind of sad honestly savannah and i we really never leave the kids like this overnight we we love being with our family it's just everything nothing compares to being with them day in day out we said it before but being youtubers doing what we do on the internet the absolute best best part about it is the amount of time that we get to spend with our kids and never having to really leave them but do you think that it's good to occasionally leave your kids um and especially just get some one-on-one time with each other in a group setting with some friends it's always healthy so really looking forward to it we need it and um yeah so if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up subscribe if you're not subscribed thumbs up for

gaming family with hippos so it's late we're about to put posing out just having our chocolate milk watching her show and savannah just got back she was actually at everly's dance all day i don't even really know where to begin with this because this happened what like before you left i like noon like it's it's late it's like it's like 7 20. what are you doing you okay yeah hang on it's like 7 20. posey what stabbed you in the eye with like a pencil you said i like noon you okay it looks really red and like kind of swollen does it burn yeah yeah so wait what happened exactly so i don't even know we were outside playing and we were drawing and she like got up really fast and like whacked me in the eye with a pencil it was a pencil but it was like the point of the pencil uh-huh like she didn't do it on purpose it was like total accident but oh it's doing it again what is just like her sweetheart yes i think there's like a really really big scrape on it or something because whenever i look this way it like starts burning and i can't open it so it's weird because like whenever it happened you came and showed me like making my nose water and stuff too yeah you kind of like pacing like it looks like it hurts like really bad you okay yes so this happened like seven hours ago you came and showed me and i didn't look too bad like i didn't like i didn't like i like examined her eye like i didn't think it was like gonna be that big of a video i was with my mom at everybody's like dance rehearsals we were watching and she looks at me and she goes your eye has gotten worse since you got here yeah i know you'll be there for like 30 minutes that was the very first thing i noticed as soon as you stepped through the door was oh your eye looks different like before it was just red now it's kind of like red and puffy and oh whenever you look that way there's a big difference in your two eyes um something happened so maybe i should go get it checked out or something because are you gonna go now well no oh yeah i'm trying to sleep tonight yeah i guess we can try to stick it off for a pencil yeah i mean look at your eye i don't wanna get worse overnight i know you're like tearing up did you just miss me are you sure you didn't just miss while you're done i pulled the chick-fil-a and you're crying they're like are you okay for i pulled up to chick-fil-a and it like i was totally fine and i started ordering and it happened and i was like oh no this is so embarrassing because i know my eyes have to shut and i like start crying so i'm like i look at my mom like i swear i'm not sad i just my kid hit me so hard today because you know that if you're actually they're going to be like checking on you yeah like any other fast food you're going to go i just start i start closing my eyes and i'm like i'll still say the order i was like so embarrassed i was like i'll tell you the order i'm like just just ignore this remember remember what happened with your pencil you hyped me in the eye you remember yeah you felt so bad huh you were like it was an accident   ordering and then he looks at me he goes he goes okay would you like anything else i'm like i'm like sorry my eye just hurts really bad he goes oh i'm so sorry like you know how the chick-fil-a guys are yeah i'm like it's okay but i'm like this guy probably just like my boyfriend just broke me or something i'm just like oh cheers okay i love you is an accident okay okay oh well we'll keep you guys updated maybe i'll go get it checked out tomorrow we'll see how it is but it's definitely but who knows maybe we'll just take it off and it'll be okay but um parents don't let your kids stab you in the eye with a pencil whenever you told me you gotta get stabbed in the eye with a pencil i'm like really the point of that my mom my mom was telling me that maybe there's like lead in my eyes yeah there could be some lead i mean either led or just a big scrape but either way you should get checked out if it's hurting really bad yeah especially especially because you can't look this way right whenever i look right whenever i look that way it it hurts really bad i know i know you know about her oh did you funky a baby the baby went night night yeah did daddy put the baby night night for me yeah it was so nice you want to go monday okay mommy will put you night night cake let's just one of the few kids who are like we'll look forward to night night time actually she gets her binky at night night so she really looks forward to it like you're only getting get night night you want to go night night thinking like she'll say no and she's like yeah i want to go tonight give me my binky it looks like it oh it looks like it's really swollen on top yeah here yeah he also got it under better lighting at look at the difference in my eyes look how much skin there is on the top right there versus that side no i know it's it's definitely something's going on but i think you just sleep on it and we see how it looks in the morning right i appreciate that   so it's the next morning and as you can tell savannah's feeling better here here face the window so i can see your eye so when i slept last night can you see it you have to look at my eyelids to see the difference really is what i noticed yeah and your eye is really red it's pretty obvious yeah it's pretty awesome yeah am i really dreaming but it does look a lot better than it did just this morning so much better so cool let me sleep in this morning which was so nice because i got sleeping and posing cozy i got to sleep in until like almost nine o'clock i don't even know the last time i slept until nine um so i kept my eye closed a lot of the night you know yep that's possible   oh she's a scary are you a mickey mouse switch   that's a freaky way don't give me go get me oh my goodness okay well where were we so as we were saying sorry kids these days so um i got to keep my eyes closed for a lot of the night which was nice because i feel like it helps obviously i got to keep my eyes closed while i slept last night but it's like a totally different eye right now we didn't even film like earlier this morning but it was really really red this morning yeah it was still bad this morning at like 6 30 this morning though it was still pretty bad and then since i slept in until nine i feel like that made a big difference and but all in all right now we're not taking her in we think it's just gonna heal on its own and i still can feel where it is in my eye i know it hurts and when i look a certain way it'll still hurt me but not as bad as i did yesterday we think it's okay we think she's i'll be fine so i will live so i will not lose my eyesight we think she's okay we're not well it really was really good i was really nervous yesterday when she first got me your mom was really nervous for you you kept telling me like maybe i could piece of lead stuck in your eyes and then you need to go get the lead taken out but i'm good today my eyes good there's no way that we know so give this video a thumbs up for savannah's eyesight subscribe if you want subscribe and uh be sure to follow us all
