hello incredible humans I'm so thankful for you and I'm so thankful that you're here and that you are who you are you're just beautiful and I'm so glad that you decided to tune in to my channel today there's a been a lot of crazy stuff happening as I'm sure all of you know regarding the corona virus and staying at home and taking precautions necessary and so with that we will see in the world a lot of fear a lot of anxiety a lot of chaos and panic and so the Lord has just placed a message on my heart to share with y'all in the midst of a time where it's easy to join in on the panic but you actually were not made to join in on the panic and you don't have to either so I've been reading through the reign of King Solomon which is in first kings and second chronicles and in second chronicles chapter 7 it's the gonna where we're gonna be basing on the message off today is where Solomon has built the temple dedicated to the Lord and they have now finished it and so now they are offering sacrifices to the Lord within the temple and they're dedicating it to the Lord so it's built they're dedicating it to him and so starting in verse 1 of chapter 7 it says when Solomon finished praying fire flashed down from heaven and burned up the burnt offerings and sacrifices and the glorious presence of the Lord filled the temple the priests could not enter the temple of the Lord because the glorious presence of the Lord filled it when all the people of Israel saw the fire coming down and the glorious presence of the Lord filling the temple they fell face down on the ground and worshiped and praised the Lord saying he is good his faithful love endures forever forever he is good his faithful love endures forever it does not end it is unconditional and he is good that's all they could come to say in such a moment and so I want you to kind of imagine your life your body your mind your heart your attention as a temple in this moment the glorious presence of the Lord filled the temple so the glorious presence of the Lord is where attention was directed because of that the priests had to leave like they could not even be in there because the presence of the Lord was so glorious it was so heavy it was so holy they had to leave only the presence of the Lord could fill such a place and all of the people of Israel who saw that to happen they had to fall face down and begin to say the Lord is good and his faithful love endures forever and I think in such a moment in such a unique season where there is disease there's panic there's uncertainty it's very easy for anxiety and fear and panic to fill our temple to fill our mind to fill our heart to fill our attention and when doing so we join in on the panic and I don't want us to look up after this season has passed and we missed an opportunity to lean into the Lord in James 4:8 it says John near to God and He will draw near to you what an incredible opportunity to be on our knees talking with the Lord to be in his word to lean into him and let him establish our steps as he leads us through this unknown territory as he reveals his glory and he works all things together for the good of those who love him and who are called according to his purpose as he uses this time for the church to rise up be the light of the world a city built on a hill that cannot be hidden and let his love and his hope be made known let the gospel be made known to all the world so that this could be a time that people come to genuinely know Jesus I don't want us to miss this time but if we allow anxiety fear panic to fill our temple to fill our mind our heart our attention then we're gonna look up and we may have missed an opportunity and so what an incredible truth to rest in the fact that wait I actually don't have to join in on the panic I actually can rest in the peace of the Lord because he is still on the throne he is worthy and he promises that he will work all things together for the good of those who love him and are called according to his purpose Romans 8:28 oh I love him he's so good and so I think what's so cool about this is in 2nd Corinthians 4:18 it says let us fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen because we know that what a scene is just temporary but what is unseen is eternal and so when I set my eyes on what is seen on the panic on the disease on the fear well it makes sense that I'm gonna want to join in on that but if I fix my eyes on the glorious presence of the Lord then just as the priests had to leave the temple so does anxiety fear panic chaos have to leave my attention when I am giving my full attention to the Lord to the glorious presence of God he's so worthy of our presence the people could not help but fall on their face and say he is good his love endures forever in Psalm 27 David prays this is the only thing that I ask this is the only thing that I seek that I may gaze upon the Lord that I may gaze upon his beauty my soul says seek his face so his face will I seek whenever I am focused on his glorious presence then just as all the Israelites had to fall face down and declare the worthiness of God so does anxiety fear chaos panic has to bow down at the name of Jesus I'll never eat something to you from Philippians 2 Oh y'all it's so good let me show you let me show you Philippians 2 it's talking about Jesus and Paul Paul is speaking here and he says it starts off in verse 6 I'm just gonna read verse 6 through 11 with you says though he Jesus was God he did not think of equality with God as something to cling to when Jesus came to become flesh and make his home among us instead he gave up his divine privileges he took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being when he appeared in human form he humbled himself in obedience to God and died a criminal's death on a cross therefore God elevated him to the place of highest honor and gave him the name above all other names that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father whenever we decide to set our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen because we know that what is seen is just temporary but what is unseen is eternal the things of this world the things that are that the enemy will use to steal kill and destroy our joy our attention our faith our confidence we can actually see the name of anxiety the name of panic the name of fear bow down to the glorious presence of the name that is Jesus the name that is above every other name it says in 2nd chronicles 7 the priests they could not enter the temple of the Lord because the glorious presence of the Lord filled it when our attention is so focused on God there's no room for fear I'm not consumed by the ways of the world whenever I'm consumed by His mercy it says and all the people of Israel saw the glorious presence of the Lord they fell face down and worshiped anxiety has to fall face down and ultimately declare who the Lord is whenever your focus is on him and so I just want to leave you with um some verses that I pray just encourage you during this time today that truly the Lord is the King of Kings the Lord is the Prince of Peace and second Thessalonians 3:16 is is that God Himself gives you peace at all times including times such as these and in every situation including situations like this and in Isaiah 26:3 it says that those who trust in the Lord and who fixed their minds on him God keeps them in perfect peace in first Peter 5:7 it says cast your cares upon the Lord he cares for you you were made it is fitting for you to have your full attention on him it is fitting for us to praise the Lord Psalm 147 it is fitting for us to sing praises to our God and for him to have our undivided attention it's literally where we were made to be is in his presence focused on his presence and who he is and when we do that we are then able to walk with wisdom walk with good judgment love people well in the midst of chaos we're not denying that there's chaos but we're proof of a Prince of Peace that is real and alive and well because we're walking with Him with our focus on him in the midst of chaos we're able to truly live out what it means to be the light of the world in acts 20:24 Paul says my life is worth nothing to me unless I use it for finishing the work assigned to me by Jesus the work of telling others the good news about the wonderful grace of God this is an opportunity to not only let the Lord bring personal rest to your soul yes my soul find rest God our hope comes from him be still and know that He is God for he will be exalted among the nations he will be exalted in all the earth not only do I personally get to experience that peace but from a place of resting in the presence of the Lord I can be a vessel of the presence of the Lord into the lives of people who have either forgotten such a hope or don't get no such a hope and in those last two verses I want to leave with you all today is philippians 4:6 through 7 it says do not be anxious about anything but in everything with prayer and petition and with Thanksgiving come and tell the Lord what's on your heart pour your heart out to him let him know what's on your heart ask him for healing ask him for clarity ask him for people to come to know him during this time thank him for who he is thank you for how he's sovereign and very the fact that he is at our right hand we will not be shaken but he's also been continually set before us Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever so we have a confident hope that is not of this world and he says that he will guard your heart and your mind with this peace that surpasses all understanding but his love his peace his presence doesn't end with you but it continues with you you were made to go share it with people you're incredible and I pray that your attention your heart your mind is focused on the glorious presence of the Lord in such a way that anxiety fear panic doesn't have room in your temple it has to fall face down declaring that Jesus is the name above every name you're so loved and I pray that this message that the Lord encouraged me with I pray that it encourages you be sure to give a thumbs up button if you were encouraged um comment below how you were

heart of stone jesus paid it all all to him I owe    and have left a crimson stain he washed it white as snow in a way and before the throne I stand in him complete Jesus dying my soul to say my lived shall still repeat jesus paid it all all to him I owe sin had left a crimson stain street white ass    blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine an air of salvation I'm purchased by God born of his sphere and washed in his blood and this is my story this is my song praising my Savior all the day long this is my story this is my song praising my Saviour perfect submission and all these address I in my Savior happy and blaze watching and way looking up filled with his good name    this is my story this is my song praising my Saviour oh the day you miss is my story this is my song praising my ello beautiful and loved and chosen precious human beings I'm so thankful for you and I'm so thankful that I get to be a part of your life in the way that I do via YouTube channel it's truly such an honor and I'm so thankful that you've joined me today I received a couple of comments and questions regarding doing a video on bullying and what does it look like to remain secure and confident whenever you're hearing many different voices telling you many different things about who you are and who you should be and where you are and where you should be and so I am so excited to dive into the word on this topic because we're all human and so there's always going to be someone who doesn't agree or someone who um is hating and so no matter who you are what your story is us being confident in our identity that's something we all need to grow in that's something we all can learn even more about and so I want to start off just by sharing a little bit of my story with you when I was about 14 that was really when I just was overwhelmed with the joy and truth of who God is and who I am in him and that he demonstrated his perfect love for me and that while I was still a sinner Christ died for me and wants to know me and have a relationship with me and so I chose for him to be the Lord of my life and to walk in relationship with him and truly like there's no turning back he he he is my friend my Savior he is my my everything and in that I can't keep that to myself I want everyone else to experience such wholeness and freedom and truth - and so I'm just began to share him everywhere whether it was the hallways of middle school in high school or it was the grocery store or it was in the walls of my home um and then the Lord put on my heart why not social media why not YouTube why not Instagram and so I started letting my captions be his word and message he would put on my heart I started making videos about message that message is that he would put on my heart because my vision is to see people come to genuinely know him because that's only where real life is found and with that though Jesus said in John 15 if the world hates you remember that it hated me first and so I began to get a lot of different opinions from a lot of different people people I knew and people I didn't know some people would tell me things on one end of the spectrum and that was you are incredible I love you and I want to be you and you are so beautiful and I look forward to your posts all the time and you're just so inspiring and so encouraging and Wow Emma then you had the other end of the spectrum and the other end of the spectrum was I hate you and your eyebrows look like hat pillars and your nose is too big and your smile is creepy and your voice is weird and your faith is a fairy tale and you are brainwashed what do you do with such extremes and everything in between I was doing a live one time on Instagram and I was talking to people from all over the world just in my room and I had one person comment and say you are hideous and literally two seconds later I've had someone else come in and comment you are so beautiful and I didn't say anything out loud I just kept talking but in my heart I just kind of laughed a little because I was like how chaotic and confusing would it be if we allowed our worth to be determined and our identity to be determined by the fickle opinion of man but it's not what we were made to rely on Jesus actually experienced the same thing and an honor this being the week of Easter the week of Jesus 2020 years ago um coming and living the life that we could not live dying the debt that we deserve and raising again on the third day after being buried to defeat sin and debt the very thing that separated us from himself so that we could be in relationship with him and experience abundant life forever literally we're celebrating that every day all day all the time but this week it's it's just a sweet time to really reflect on what that means what does that mean to me just really honoring the Lord and remembering that time and so um I want to kind of go back to that week in Scripture together this week so I want to start off in Matthew 21 verse 9 because in Matthew 21 verse 9 Jesus is entering into the city of Jerusalem it's the week that it's the week of Passover it's the week that he's going to be crucified and rise again yeah he did and um so in verse 9 it literally says that Jesus was in the center of the procession and people all around him were shouting praise God for the son of David blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord praise God in the highest heaven so they are celebrating adoring praising everything about Jesus like it is Hosanna Hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord literally within the same week Luke 23 verse 21 the people kept shouting crucify him crucify him within the very same week people were praising him and people were cursing him and I think some of us have built up this idea that if we can just be enough if we can reach a certain standard if we can just be perfect then maybe then we won't have haters we won't have people who disagree with us and we won't have opinions who aren't I'm accepting of who we are then that'll be that so basically the goal is for me to be enough then people won't hate me I'll be loved by everyone well I want to combat that idea with encouragement Jesus literally was perfect we we can't be perfect on our own we screwed up so he came was tempted in every way so he could empathize with us in our weakness but he didn't sin no flaw at all he was the perfect sacrifice on our behalf and in doing so though he was still cursed and he was still praised so that tells me that if Jesus was perfect and he still had haters that maybe just maybe the goal is not for us to be perfect so that everyone can agree with us I think that we're here on earth for something a little bit more than that the the words of people dictating your life is going to drive you insane it's actually a trap it will get you caught up confused that we're going and how you got there in proverbs 29:25 it says to fear the to fear the words of people to fear man is a trap but to fear the Lord is safety there is safety and security and unwavering confidence when we are relying on who God is and who he says we are that just make you smile it says in isaiah 55:10 and tho and 11 that god's word it's like the rain for the rain falls from the heavens and it doesn't return back to the heavens until fulfilling the purpose of causing budding and flourishing to happen on the earth in the same way God's Word does not leave his mouth and return back to him until fulfilling the purpose for which he sent it there's power and freedom and knowing who God says you are when people are commenting about my physical appearance and my beauty and questioning it hating on it making me try and be insecure about it well I can go back to what God said Genesis 1:27 I'm made in God's image mister 4:14 I've been made for such a time as this Psalm 139 14 I am fearfully and wonderfully made Ephesians 2:10 I am his workmanship masterpiece handiwork created in Christ Jesus to do good works which he prepared in advance for me to do that's what my God says so whenever something comes and opposes it I'm able to hold it up to the light and actually take it captive and make it obedient to what is actually true but not only that when I see myself the way God sees me I can see others the way that God sees others there's a confidence there jesus said in Luke 6:27 through 28 you've been told to love those who love you back anybody can do that he said very truly I tell you though to love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you and bless those who curse you that's another level and I can't genuinely do that if I don't first know that God has blessed me and that he loves me and that he is for me and then I can understand wait this is actually an incredible opportunity to love someone when I'm being hated because they themselves don't know how loved they are you don't know their story so what an incredible opportunity no matter what their response is I'm gonna love them I'm gonna bless them I can't live my life in fear of what their response is gonna be or I can't live my life based on what I think their response is gonna be because if I'm doing that then I'm living based on what other people are thinking I'm living in the fear of man I am going to love I am going to bless and I'm going to pray for not because they loved me first not because they hated on me simply because my God first loved me so regardless of what they do I choose to love them Paul said in Philippians for I know what it is to have plenty but I also know what it is to be in need aka I know what it is to be praised and I know what it is to be hated on but I've learned the secret of being content I've learned the secret of being solid and who I am and that is that I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength after Jesus was blessed he was cursed and he was put on the cross buried in the tomb rose three days later he defeated sin and death this the word in the beginning John 1 in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God the word Hebrews 13 is the same yesterday today and forever and it has all authority it is victorious it is unwavering unchanging and so how much more freeing is it whenever you can just rest in the truth that I am who God says I am and when other people tell me what I'm not I'm given an opportunity to rest in truth and I'm given an opportunity to love my dad told me this one time he said we were made to worship we weren't made to be worshipped when I try and take on the comments of other people I'm taking on a burden I was never meant to carry that's why whether I'm told I'm beautiful or I'm told I'm hideous I can take it to the feet of Jesus and rest in what he's already said about me his word is freeing John 8:32 you will know the truth and it will set you free you are so valued you are so special you are so beautiful whenever you choose to declare that Jesus is your Lord and you choose to receive him as your savior believing that he is who he says he is and that he did what he claimed to do what His Word says he did you are a child of God you've been given the right to be called a child of God nothing in all of creation neither height nor depth Angels nor demons the past the present the future could ever separate you from God and when you're walking in the truth that you have been saved by grace through faith not by your own work so that you can't can boast that it's from the gift of God no longer are you living for approval for love for affirmation for comments of praise but you are living from a place of acceptance from a place of love from a place of adoration you already know that God loves you he saved you he's rescued you he he's for you and not against you therefore you can live in a life of gratitude and praise and freedom because you realize I'm not striving to earn these things I'm living from a place of accepting these things and therefore when it comes to what people have to say it kind of gives you a perspective Matthew 7 jesus said when you hear with my words and you put them into practice you're like you're like a person who stands on solid rock that no matter what comes at you you're not gonna be shaken we were designed to rest in the secure word of the Lord and worship him whenever we try and receive the worship of people we're going to crumble why because it's not what we were made for we were literally made to worship the father and receive his word about us and live that out you are so wonderful you mean so much to me and I pray that this message is an encouragement to you and I pray that you know how special you are to the Lord have an amazing

thank you so much for being you thank you so much for being here with me you are so appreciated and so loved and I pray that you were having just the best day and that you know full well that God's goodness and love is pursuing you passionately and wholeheartedly today because you are worth his pursuit in his eyes which is insane that we are so special to the king of the universe that he would make us in His image and make us for himself and that just blows my mind and so I pray that you were overwhelmed with the realization and awareness of how much God loves you and of his pursuit of your heart and your mind and your life today I'm really excited about today's video so before I get into everything I don't know how many of y'all have seen my most recent video about my friend ha I am literally just overwhelmed with gratitude and so stoked Josh McDaniel is a stellar human and God is truly the God who is able to do exceedingly and good abundantly greater things and then what we could ever ask or imagine and I am so excited I get to love God and love people with my man Josh McDaniel and so so next week definitely have your I out have your ear out because me and Josh will be doing a video about my perspective in his perspective in the whole engagement day and leading up to the day and what God has already been revealing to us just a week later so definitely stay tuned for that but I just had to celebrate because whenever whenever you're excited and you're in love you want to tell people about it so I had to share because God is just so good and I'm overwhelmed by his faithfulness um he's so kind he's so kind but today in other news a really interesting story to share with y'all that I never really knew I would share in this way but I'm excited um so it may sound kind of weird but stay with me um so I did not know this until like about a year ago but I have a zinc deficiency so my body basically doesn't um naturally produce enough zinc and because of that I will get little warts on my knees so like all throughout high school and like my first year of college I had these warts on my knees and by my freshman year of college like I had a total of 15 on both knees and some of them were like big and so like I would be like insecure about wearing skirts or shorts and it would be the hottest day and I'd be wearing jeans because I was insecure about these works on my knees and so I went to the dermatologist and um they are now my friends because I went so often and because it's just fun building relationships with people but um I wanted these words gone and whenever I found out what was the source to heal them based on my deficiency that was needed to be met and fulfilled was zinc and medicine and putting like lotion on it and so like y'all I was so persistent and consistent about putting my lotion and my medicine on my warts and taking my zinc because I wanted these suckers gone I was tired of them I was tired of these little bumps all over my nice and finally um all of the warts went away like my skin was beautiful and clear and all of them were gone and after they were gone I stopped taking my zinc every day because I was like like I wasn't as eager to take it because according to what I saw I didn't really meet it like I was doing fine my knees were beautiful had beautiful knees guys um and so it just wasn't as much of a priority on my list to take zinc and after about six months of not really being consistent to take my zinc another little wart started growing on my knee and so immediately I was like I need to go find my zinc like I'm seeing something bad bring itself back up and I was like I was reminded of my deficiency I was reminded that wait like I don't produce zinc on my own I need Mazique and so I started taking zinc again and I as all this was happening I began to think about this season that we're in and how we're in a pandemic and the world is a little chaotic right now with covin 19 and with plans being canceled and a lot of uncertainty and a lot of opportunity to be afraid and I began to think about the word deficiency and the word deficiency it literally means shortage or lack and we were all made by God for God we were made in His image to be in relationship with him and we are not walking in relationship with God we are walking in a lack we are walking with a shortage we have a deficiency because it says in Psalm 23 one that the Lord is my shepherd I lack no good thing it's in him that I lack no good thing and he says in John 15:5 I'm gonna just read this y'all in John 15:5 Jesus says yes I am the vine and you are the branches those who remain in me and I in them will produce much fruit for apart from me you can do nothing apart from Jesus we're walking with a shortage of joy we're walking with a shortage of peace we're walking with a deficiency of hope and life and purpose because he is all of those things so when we're not walking hand-in-hand with him then we're missing out on the goodness that would were made to walk in we were made to experience and I think right now there are many people many of us who are now being aware of our deficiency like we're afraid we're uncertain their sickness it's it's a little cray-cray and we're realizing wait a second I I i I'm seeing the warts on the knee I'm seeing the circumstances and I'm realizing wait God I need you I haven't been talking to you much lately I haven't been seeking you I haven't been in your word but I need you and so we're on our knees and we're in prayer and we're in his word and it's so beautiful but I want to challenge you with the question what happens when everything goes back to normal when your warts go away your knees are beautiful and clear when your plans are now going the way that you wrote on your calendar when everybody's healthy when routine is back in order when there's no lack of toilet paper what are you gonna then stop taking your zinc forget that it is only in the Lord that you have a full supply of life and joy and peace and purpose are you gonna forget that without him we have a deficiency we have a shortage because anything can look good for a little while like not seeking the Lord doing your own thing doing what what feels good what looks good maybe not even like purposefully but like you're just it may it may even be my schedule is full and so I'm not making it a priority to spend time in the Lord but because I have so many things to do now that my routines back in order and now that I can go out I can go to work I can go to the gym I can it's like there's so many things I have to catch back up on so like time with the Lord is kind of put on a back burner that can last you a little while you'll have some fuel for a hot minute give it some time and you'll begin to see the warts start to and it may not be in the form of a pandemic but it may be in the form of you lose your temper more easily you find yourself getting more anxious about things maybe you're not as plugged into community because you find yourself just isolating it's it's different for it's different for each season um but Psalm 113 3 says that from the rising of the Sun to its setting the name of the Lord is to be praised Ecclesiastes 3:11 said that God has planted eternity in the human heart we were made to walk with Him day by day from the rising of the Sun to its setting Philippians 4 mobians 4 verse 19 it says and this same God who takes care of me Paul says will supply all your needs from his glorious riches which have been given to us in Christ Jesus it is God who supplies all of our needs it is God who is our source of joy it is God who is our sort who is our sustainer it is God who is our source of hope Romans 15:13 says now God it was our source of hope may he fill you may he fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him and may you abound in confident hope by the power of the Spirit just as when my warts went away I wasn't as eager to take my zinc because I couldn't see circumstances that gave me reason to and then they're the worst started coming back house like wait I gotta go I got a good farmers Inc I think sometimes it's very easy to only go to God in the bad times only go to God when we need something only go to God when everything seemed tough but we literally were made with a deficiency without him in the Lord I lack no good thing but without the Lord I lack all good things because he is good apart from him have nothing Jesus said so I want to challenge you and encourage you but apart from him as a deficiency of life and hope and peace and joy and purpose Psalm 23 says the Lord is my shepherd I like no good thing in him he leads me beside still in quiet waters and makes me lie down in green pastures every day he restores my soul he guides me along the right paths for his name's sake and even though I walked the darkest Valley in the shadow death I will fear no evil because he's with me his rod and his staff comfort me he prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies he anoints my head with oil and my cup overflows surely his goodness and love follows me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever better is one day in his presence than a thousand elsewhere there is freedom and joy that is found when we realized that we desperately need the Lord every moment of every day that without him we have a deficiency I pray that when our schedules go back to normal when the warts go away that you see I pray that you may continue to seek the Lord wholeheartedly because sometimes our warts aren't shown in the circumstances on the outside but warts begin to grow in our heart they begin to grow in our thought patterns and we don't even notice them until we look up one day we realize we haven't been seeking the one who literally overflows our cup fills our soul and supplies where we are lacking God is our everything and true life is found whenever we actually rest and humble ourselves to acknowledge that he is our everything we can't do it on their own and it's beautiful because we weren't made - we were made in His image for him to be in relationship with him not only whenever there's a pandemic not only when everything's are difficult but all the time when things are going well we praise him when things are difficult we praise him whenever we are selling whenever things are going well and we're celebrating we sing praises whenever we're suffering we come to him in prayer he is worthy of our full attention all the time without him there's a deficiency whether or not you see it right now in the season that you're in without him you're missing out on the fool abundance that you made to walk in don't let this season be the only season you seek the Lord because it seemed kind of crazy let every season be a season that you seek the face of the Lord because you realize without him make sure to give this video a thumbs up

blameless through his son I pray that you just be encouraged during this time it's easy to be afraid his perfect love casts out all fear and in him and you have no reason to worry we love you hello my lovely lovely lovely friends i'm so thankful for you and i'm so thankful that you have joined me today happy day you are just incredible and i pray that you don't forget how awesome you are today welcome back to my channel this is a video that i'm actually like really excited about because i did a story on instagram regarding this topic that the lord put on my heart and had a lot of people um respond in a way that they were encouraged that they were sharing it with other friends so that they could um watch it together and be encouraged and because stories on instagram leave in 24 hours i wanted to put this message also on here so that more of you could hopefully be encouraged but also those of you who wanted to go back to it or wanted to keep it and save it it would be here permanently for you to refer back to and be encouraged by and the topic i'm referring to is the acknowledgement of seniors and um just mainly seniors but different people i trust that god will use this to reach whoever needs this um but the lord put seniors on my heart because um a lot of things are being canceled that we have looked forward to whether it be track season soccer season baseball season proms graduations um and that's just one category but then there's also um tons of different precious people whether it be work or it be um different events that were planned for this spring like there's just there's a lot of things even beyond those of you who are seniors or who are in that um season of being in school there are a lot of us who are also in different seasons where we're having to process through plans changing and there's grief that comes along with that and um it's not easy but i had this on my heart that i think sometimes as believers as followers of the lord it's almost hard for us to approach grief it's almost hard for us to process um sadness because whenever we hear verses like rejoice always or be of great cheer because god is overcome we almost have a hard time acknowledging when we're sad or when we're needing to grieve or when we're upset because we may not feel as though we even have permission to and that's just not the case and so i wanted to just speak truth into this by the power of the word um and so i want to start off in ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 4. and in ecclesiastes chapter 3 solomon is talking about how there is a time for everything and specifically in verse 4 he says there is a time to cry and a time to laugh a time to grieve and a time to dance there is a time for those things and the season that we're in right now it's a time where we a lot of us are needing to process grief a lot of us are needing to process unexpected sorrow and that's that's okay um something really really powerful is whenever we are actually real about where we are because whenever we're real about where we are we're able to experience the presence and the promises of god at a greater depth than if we were just to pretend that we're okay because god's promises are real and present no matter what but whenever we pretend like we're okay we slap a smile on our face and we we don't allow ourselves to process what we're actually feeling we may miss the opportunity of truly realizing how god's comfort meets me whenever i'm hurting how god's peace meets me whenever my soul is chaotic how his rest meets me whenever i just i can't settle down whenever his joy meets me when i'm in great sorrow when i actually acknowledge that i'm sad and i actually acknowledge that i'm uncomfortable when i actually acknowledge that i'm frustrated i'm able to experience him meet me there in a much more real way which is just so sweet that god loves us so much that he would meet us right where we are but he loves us too much to leave us there and in psalm 34 18 it says that the lord is near to the brokenhearted and he saves the crushed in spirit in philippians 4 6-7 this is a verse i feel like i go back to a lot but it's on my heart regarding this topic and that is that the lord says do not be anxious about anything don't worry he says about anything well whenever i first read that we must then therefore be experiencing or will experience opportunities to worry we're right now in a season of uncertainty and a season of frustration in a season where things are being canceled um and so it's easy to worry about certain things but god says don't worry i understand that you're in a place that makes sense to according to the world but i tell you do not worry and instead he says come to me he says do not worry about anything but in everything talk to me about it pray come to me with petition and with thanksgiving tell him what's on your heart tell him how you're feeling what's so sweet is that the lord already fully knows us he already fully understands it says in psalm 139 that the lord has searched me and he knows me he knows my thoughts from afar he knows the words on my tongue before i even say them he knows when i go out and when i lie down he's familiar with all my ways and yet still in matthew 11 28-30 jesus said come to me he still wants to hear you telling him where you are he still wants to just sit with you and listen and in that he says come to me all who are weary and burdened in matthew 11 and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble at heart my yoke is easy and my burden is light and if you continue in philippians 4 6 and 7 do not be anxious about anything but in everything with prayer and petition come to me you have permission to feel what you're feeling but i love you too much to leave you there in the midst of acknowledging that honestly i want to reveal to you my presence and my promises in the midst of it there's something so sweet and freeing like the our feelings like the lord blessed us that's one of the beauties of being human that we get to have emotion we get to have feelings but something so powerful is that when we begin to trust the promises of the lord it is not our feelings and our emotions that dictate what we say how we act how we respond where we go it is his truth psalm 119 105 his word is only up to our feet and a light to our path how sweet is it he says don't be anxious about anything but in everything come to me and talk about it with prayer and petition tell me what's on your heart and with thanksgiving thank him for who he is thank him that he is faithful and steadfast even whenever you may not feel it right now thank him for this day that he has made and the fact that his joy nehemiah 8 10 is my strength so i will rejoice and be glad in it even when i don't feel like it why because as i come to the lord honestly about how i'm feeling about where i'm at his truth meets me there and what's so cool about that is as you continue in that verb in those two verses it says and the peace of god surpasses all understanding will guard your heart and your mind in christ jesus the peace of god is not circumstantial the peace of god is not it's not powerful and real and present based on what season of life you're in or based on what scenario you are facing but the peace of god reigns true reigns supreme and a steadfast because god is peace and god reigns true god is steadfast that's who he is he is peace and so because peace is not circumstantial it doesn't matter what season you're going through what emotion you are encountering what feeling you're processing his peace surpasses all understanding and he wants to guard your heart and your mind with it in christ jesus and something really powerful about this is that it's such a testament to the world whenever we as believers are honest about where we are like yeah this is frustrating i was really excited about prom i was really excited to walk across the stage i was really excited to experience this season with my teammates i was planning i was preparing i was i was so excited and i've gone to bed crying because things didn't go as i thought they would all this anticipation led to it not really looking the way so many people look forward to it looking but yet i still have joy i still have peace i still have hope romans 15 13 now god who is my source of hope he fills me with all joy and peace as i what as i trust in him in the midst of my feelings and i am abounding in his confident hope by the power of his spirit and whenever we as believers are honest about where we are yet we still have joy the world's like okay you're experiencing the same thing i'm experiencing as non-believers non-believers are also experiencing plans being changed things being cancelled expectations maybe not being met the way that they anticipated it to believers are going through the same thing non-believers are going through in the sense that things are being canceled but i pray that the world would take note that as believers in the midst of our grief and sorrow and frustration a joy and a peace is noticed and the wor the world's like how why like you're going through the same thing i'm going through yet you have this calmness about you that i don't have how are you doing that and as a testament to the world say because i'm choosing to trust in the god who is my source of hope and fills me with all joy and peace as i trust in him because i'm choosing to trust in the god isaiah 55 whose ways are higher than my ways whose thoughts are higher than i than my thoughts because i'm choosing to trust in the god who assures me that i don't have to worry and he guards my heart and my mind and his peace that surpasses all understanding sometimes rejoicing always and being of good cheer doesn't look like a smile but it means that you have a steadiness and a calmness and a joy that cannot be shaken in the midst of being sad and in the midst of processing things that are tough what a testament to the presence and the promises of the lord in the midst of frustration and sadness solomon said there's a time to cry and a time to laugh there's a time to grieve and there's a time to dance but the lord's peace is not based on whether or not you're crying or based whether or not you're laughing the peace of god is steadfast in the midst of all of it in the midst of every season doesn't that just make you want to dance you're so loved sweet one and i don't know who that was for but i pray that god uses it just to encourage you that you have permission to be upset you have permission to be sad and to process those things but the lord wants you to come to him with those things because in the midst of being honest he wants to reveal to you the depth of his promise in the midst of it and let that be what dictates and establishes your steps because again i'll just say it i'll just say it one more time whenever we pretend like everything's okay or we don't allow ourselves to experience the times to cry and the times to laugh the times to grieve and the times to dance we may miss out on experiencing a deeper level of god's character had we not just been real and vulnerable about where we are and therefore experience how he meets us there in a way we didn't even know possible you are so loved you are so seen and i'm so sorry for all the plans that you had that aren't going accordingly but i pray that you can just be encouraged that god sees you he understands and he's inviting you to come to him honest about where you are but he wants to reveal his truth in the midst of it and let that truth be what dictates where you go let that truth prevail in the midst of your feelings and let that truth reveal his heart to you you are stellar so beyond loved and you matter so much to god i'm so thankful for you and i pray that this encouraged you in some way um make sure to subscribe

i love you sweet people oh and um i know that last week i made a video saying that mine and josh's engagement video would be coming this week and it is delayed because it just requires a little bit of editing because we did something fun with it but it is coming so stay tuned for that um y'all are just so so so special to me bye friends you beautiful people I free that you just had the best week ever and that you know how loved you are how unique you are and how seen and valued you are I'm so excited because this week is just fun and a little different because it is launch week of my 30 day devotional all caps you a 30 day adventure toward finding joy and who God made you to be I'm literally so excited and I'm so thankful that I get to share it with you I fun story um I began writing this book when I was a junior in high school and now I've just finished my sophomore year of college so it has been such a precious journey with the Lord of writing and praying and editing and waiting and praying and writing and editing and waiting some more and and again and again and it's been so fruitful and I have grown in my walk with the Lord and um God has asked me to teach what I myself am learning and now it's no longer behind closed doors but it is getting to be shared with you and I'm so excited about what God is going to do and through it because I've already seen what he has been doing and it's for his praise and it's for his glory it's full of a complete 30 day devotional so there's 30 different topics within this book and it's so fun because there's tons of different topics within this book such as waiting in the Lord or thoughts are like thought life and how do we take thoughts captive and make them obedient to Christ what does that look like modesty friendships and your identity in Christ I mean tons of different different chapters what is the gospel what does it look like to daily live out the gospel I'm just really excited and what I think is so cool is that there are tons there's 30 different topics within this book but God's Word fills I mean lavishes every single chapter and I just want to speak life into you regarding that simple fact because there is no topic you will ever approach there is no circumstance you will ever walk through there's no situation you will ever be in that God's Word does not meet you there that His Word does not address that His Word does not reveal his heart to your heart in the midst of where you are in psalm 119:105 God says that his word is a lamp for our for our feet and a light on our path his word guides us along the right paths for his name's sake Psalm 23 and so there's such confidence no matter what topic I'm facing no matter what chapter of my life I'm going through I have confidence I have hope I have peace because the promises of God lead me through every single one of them faithfully and without fail that's who he is and I'm really excited about the title and the heartbeat behind this book it's all caps you and in John 10:10 Jesus is speaking and I just want to like I just want to read it to you I'm reading out of the NLT version but in John 10:10 it says the thief's purpose is to steal and kill and destroy my purpose Jesus says is to give them a rich and satisfying life in other versions it says I have come so that they have may have life and have it to the full and other versions say that I've come so they may have life and have it abundantly like God came so that we would overflow in purpose in life enjoy he's so good he's so good and he promises in in Ephesians 3:20 that he is able to do exceedingly and abundantly greater things than what we could ever ask or imagine according to his power at work within us to him be the glory for ever and ever in the church amen that's who he is and so whenever I read that um one of the things that I hear when reading this verse is basically if the Lord says that the enemy's whole purpose is to steal kill and destroy what I basically hear is he has come so I may live in all lowercase letters live in timidity shame deflated defeated discouraged but I won't live out the fullness of what God has I'll be in lower-case but Jesus says my purpose is that you may have a rich satisfying life be whole and me lack no good thing I overflow your cup have life abundant what do I hear when I read that all caps you Jesus came said that you would be completely who he originally designed you to be fearfully and wonderfully made for such a time as this beautiful there is something within you that God has given for you to share with the world to glorify him and it's so unique and God wants you to experience him and experience all that you have been called to be through him on this side of eternity and it makes me think of 2nd Timothy 1:7 that says God has not given us a spirit of fear or timidity he's not given us a spirit of lowercase letters but he's given us a spirit of power love and a sound mind proverbs 28 1 says that the righteous are as bold as a lion in Hebrews 10:35 we are not like those who shrink back don't lose this confident trust you in the Lord for it will be richly rewarded and my prayer for you is Ephesians one that your heart may be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident hope that he has given to those he is called you are so loved by God and you were made to live in all-caps life be the all-caps full abundant version of who God purposefully made you to be for such a time as this and the reason this book is so full of God's Word and is so prayed over and the reason I'm so excited to share it with you is because I pray that it either leads you to personally know him if you don't yet know him and I pray that it leads you to have a deepened relationship with him if you do know him I pray that this book leads you to the book of life the book that brings promises that don't feel this book that is alive and active sharper than a double-edged sword Hebrews 4 but as a that is been made profitable for teaching correcting rebuking and training in righteousness God breathed he's so good and he loves you so much you are a limited-edition you are chosen you are loved you are fully known and you are fully treasured by the Lord and I pray that your stellar self is encouraged as you read this book so if you haven't gotten your copy I'm gonna put the link below so that your incredible self can go order it and it's also an audio version so you can listen to it on audible so I will put that link below as well I'm so thankful for you and I pray that y'all just had the best week ever be sure and give this video a thumbs up comment below of comment of content that you would like to see later or questions that you have or how you were encouraged by this video you are so special to me and I'm so thankful for you and be sure and go follow me on this first Corinthians 13 underscore I love you guys man how do you even start this before we even started dating a man I went out on on a little coffee date it wasn't really a date it was just kind of getting to know each other and because we were both going to Liberty and I got to ask her what her hobbies were and what she enjoyed and I got to ask her about her family and she went on and on about how she just loves her family so much and she started telling me the stories about her family and one story stood out in particular and it was her story about her dad taking her out on a date and there was a story about her dad got all dressed up and got in a limo and picked her up and then took her to a fancy restaurant and didn't challenged her by giving her a beauty ring to honor God with her purity and that she shouldn't settle on herself that she shouldn't take anything less than what her dad is doing for her right now of treating her with such respect and such love that just showed me of how emma has such high standards for the guy she's with and so after that honestly we were just remain friends until November 29th of 2018 and that's the day that we actually started dating and immediately I was in awe of how amazing him is I actually told Emma crazy get up I told Emma on our very first date that Emma I'm in this for the long haul and I plan on marrying you pretty bold but I surely meant it I wasn't dating just a date I was ready to be serious about this relationship and to find the woman that I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with uh-hum and so then time goes on and prayer and wisdom is poured into this relationship and we both know that this is gonna be the person that I marry this is gonna be the person that I spend the rest of my life with and so I started looking all over every jewelry shop and everything of what ring will be able to show Emma that she's so special and that she is so loved and I know that emma is very sentimental and she has a very sitting little heart and it's so sweet and so I went to her mom and I asked her if she has any family jewelry or family diamonds or anything that that I would be able to incorporate into a ring and so excitingly her mom gave me some give me some diamonds to put into the ring and then I went and looked at all over her Pinterest and got some ideas on what type of design and what type of things she likes and all the stuff and I went to a jeweler and I got it customized and so I finally get the ring and so excited to give it to her but I'm just thinking about the right time and trying to be wise with jobs and everything like that in school and so finally suddenly on a time that we would get engaged December rolls around I asked him as dad if I can marry Emma I'm telling you what that is the most nerve-wracking and scariest conversation ever but as he gave us his blessing he just poured encouragement over us knowing that God will protect and provide for us but just encouraging us that we can continue to glorify God that we can continue to represent his name through all the nations so me and Josh have at this point been dating for a little less than a year and a half and truly I have grown more in love with the Lord become more of who God has called me to be learned even more about the beauty of life just by simply getting to be in a dating relationship with Josh like it has been such a sweet year of fun and a sweet year of growth not everything was easy but every day was worth it and I I think it's cool that sometimes people ask me like what moment did I know that Josh was the person I wanted to do life with and I don't think it was one particular moment but it truly was moment by moment day by day that the Lord would confirm his peace in me and assure me that this was the man that God was gifting me to do life with and so now we're in sophomore year college um it's a spring finally comes and start planning on a time that we would get engaged and with parents and was friend and everything around us we play on April 18th April 18th we're going to do this big celebration we're gonna fly everybody up to Virginia and we're gonna have all that our friends there and we're gonna go shopping any breakfast and at the end of the day I would propose at this overlook over these mountains but then spring break comes and the corona virus outbreak happens and we get the news that you need to go home because of the cove in 19 that's that's happening so because we live three minutes down the road from each other back in Arkansas we made the trek back home of course immediately I was very bummed out that I wasn't gonna be able to propose I mean the time that I wanted to and the time that we were going to but I knew that God was still gonna provide an amazing time that would be able to show Emma of how special she is and how loved she is so we finally head back home and plan a goes to plan B and Plan B goes to plan C and we're just continue to think of these all these plans and we wanted to fly all our friends down but the border started closing and then we wanted to do the same exact plan in Virginia but just do it in Arkansas but all the stores were closing and so it just wasn't working out but finally we decided let's mimic the date that she had with her dad let's mimic and honor her and her dad in that time and a couple of weeks into being quarantined being at home I got a very interesting text message from my hairdresser but I wasn't super surprised to get a text from her because she's my friend and I love getting my hair done and she texted me and was like hey I'm doing house calls to help women feel good and pampered and loved during this time and I was wondering if you would like me to come over to your house to do your hair and I was like yes that would be incredible and we tricked him into thinking that her hairdresser is doing in house calls so that she could be able to come and do her hair and then my dad came up to me and he was like let's go on a date this week and I always like absolutely but I never really like question anything about it because that's just who my dad is like my dad took me out on my first date when I was 13 and I mean he decked it out to the nines he got a limo we dressed up he honored me in every way when I was little he would paint my fingernails and go back and clean it up with q-tips like he's just a father who has always reflected the heart of my heavenly father to show me how loved and cherished and pursue tiny'mon so my dad was like Emma you're back home from college I left go on a date and I'm like yeah that same week my mom she said Emma I wouldn't have a girls night so I want to get your nail your nails painted I'll paint my nails with you and we'll just hang out and so this was just also such a sweet thing that I almost expected because me and my mom have painted our nails together since I was super little and so we painted our nails and she ordered in a dress and from from the online boutique and I thought well this is just stellar because every girl needs a dress for the summertime so all of these things getting my hair done getting my nails painted my dad asking me I date my mom ordering an address online I honestly didn't really think much of these things beyond the fact that I'm just grateful for parents who loved so well and brings such fun in the midst of a quarantine time but Friday comes and so the day the proposal comes around and I tell Emma I'm gonna be out the lake all day I'll see you tomorrow and I love the fact that my dad just wanted to make me feel so special and so I had my new dress that my mom had gotten me and me and my dad both dressed up and we got in his truck and we were gonna go out on a date and as we drove out to where he was taking me again I had no idea where he would be taking me but I trusted him I had no idea because everything was shut down like no no restaurants are open but we were driving in his truck to wherever he um had planned for us to be that night then finally they're getting ready and I start heading out to the vineyard getting it all set up and getting it all I look beautiful for Emma and we get to this old run-down Chapel and as my dad drives into the parking lot and we get out we're walking towards the chapel doors and we stop and he said Emma before we take any more steps further I have I have a letter for you and it was a two-page letter that he had personally written and as we're standing there and he's reading this letter to me this letter is full of words of affirmation it's full of truths of how proud he is of me and how much he loves me and he reminds me of that first date that he had taken me on and how the night of our first date when I was 13 him and my mom challenged me to honor the Lord with my body by choosing not to settle because God doesn't settle on us we're not called to settle on ourselves and so he was just affirming how I had walked with the Lord up to this point only by God's grace and strength and he also reminded me in his letter about a letter that I had written when I was 16 and this letter was full of qualities that I was praying for a future husband and um truly this this is something that I will a moment that I will never forget because as my dad reminded me of that letter that list he said Emma there's a man who has now entered the picture and he has my blessing and he not only meets the qualities of this list that you never said her on but you always added to you he is this list and he's waiting on those chapel doors right behind you and as I've walked you up to this point in your journey it's not time for me to to pass you on to this man who God has placed in the picture of your life and tears started building in his eyes and he kissed me and hugged me and it was one of the most cherished moments that I will I will never forget and I turn around and there Josh is standing in the doorway of the chapel and as I left my dad and I walked towards Josh I kind of started putting two and two together of what was happening that okay Wow I'm about to enter into this season and it was feelings of gratitude and Julie and giddiness and it was also just amazement just trying to take it all in and just it was a sweet moment honestly between me and the Lord like god you're so good here we go and so I walked up to Josh and was honestly just so excited to see him because I hadn't seen him all day um because he said he was going out to the lake house with his family and so I thought I was like you're not at the lake and we walked down the church aisle and we get to the end of the aisle and we're standing on this beautiful rug and there were flowers um set up just I mean stunning roses of tons of different colors and greenery everywhere and there was a table and on the table there was this white canvas trying to return this list of qualities that I want in a wife this quality is that I've been praying ever since I was 16 and instead of the thing the qualities that I want know why on the top of the list it says that Emma you are and then reading on the list of how she's tender-hearted she's sensible I'm just continuing on and he began to share with me his heart in our relationship and how he views me with the eyes of the Lord and we prayed this this truly this is another moment that God just assured my heart that I was getting to hold the hands of a man who again was coming to the Lord in prayer to surrender our relationship with the Lord to a surrender our relationship to the Lord and so Josh prayed in thankfulness over our dating relationship thanking God for how he's brought us through thanking God for how he was faithful to us in the moment by moment and also saying God we give you this next season we ask that you would lead us we ask that you would teach us to do your will may your good spirit lead us on level ground we ask that you would use us use us to make your name known among the nations use us God to be vessels of your light so that all people can be redirected to look at you and after that got to just tell him how I can't imagine my life without her and then I want to spend the rest of my life with her and I asked her I got down to that one knee I said MMA will you marry me so after saying yes one of the easiest yeses in my entire life Josh put this ring on my finger and I was automatically amazed because it was just so beautiful but I was more blown away by the fact that it had a deeper meaning behind it Josh customized the ring and he gave me a letter that shared the details of how this ring was exactly customized and I want to share it with you because of how just of how sweet it is and how special it is to my heart and I pray that I pray that it inspires you and the middle diamond was a part of my mom's engagement ring the outer diamonds on the top where they were a part of my grandmother's wedding ring and the the diamonds on like the band part were a part of my great-grandmother's pendant and that pendant was given to her by my great-grandfather for their 50th wedding anniversary so within this ring is a hundred and thirty over a hundred and thirty years of marriage and so every time I look at it I'm simply reminded of how faithful God is and truly humbled that the Lord would allow me and Josh to be a continuation of that legacy that reveals something much bigger than us it reveals the heart and the character and the faithfulness of God and it's so sweet and I'm just so excited and the rest of the day was full of joy I think the excitement only grows that night I truly stayed up till 3:30 in the morning because I'm so excited and I'm still encouraged to because the Lord is so constant even in the midst of seasons that are inconsistent so we're no longer dating I'm gonna marry Josh McDaniel I'm I'm going to be Miss McDaniel but what's so cool is I'm serving the same God that I served when we were dating and so just as we leaned into the Lord dating for a year and a half we now get to lean into the Lord in this season of engagement because just as he led us through the last season he's going to lead us through this season because he's the same yesterday today and forever he is gone before us and he is also our right hand and we will not be shaken but I wouldn't want to do this with any other fella    you hello stellar world-changers welcome back my channel I'm so deeply grateful that you were here I genuinely believe that my gratitude just deepens and grows richer each and every week just because I have the honor of getting to share what God has shared with me to y'all and I pray that these videos leave you better than how you found them and I pray that this is just a time that light and hope and encouragement is breathed into your life and over your life and sends you forth y'all are just stellar and you matter so much to me but you matter so much more to the Lord I'm so excited about today's message so I just finished my sophomore year of college by the grace and strength of the Lord Jesus name he is so good we finished well and it was such a year of growth and beauty and purpose because God is just good like that but before I entered into my sophomore year of college I was here for the summer and I went downstairs into the kitchen with my dad and I was like okay dad so 20 years old entering into sophomore year of college what is a nugget of wisdom that you have my dad is a well of wisdom a godly man who gives godly advice and I was just excited to hear what God would share with him to share with me and what he shared is something that I have tucked away and will cherish forever and get so giddy every time I have the joy of getting to share it with someone so I am beyond thrilled that I get to share it with you today what he shared with me was he said Emma you're going to hear many voices in your life whether that be voices from your professors voices from family voices from friends you're going to hear a lot of voices but I encourage you to take every that you hear and sift it through the Word of God if it aligns with God's Word then it is credible it is true but if it does not then it is not true because God's Word is our source and standard of what is true I am so thankful for my dad I truly could stop the video right now and that would be that would be so much for you to go and chew on and think God and just learn from but what's so so sweet is I've also been reading through the Bible chronologically recently and I'm currently in like the first Kings second chronicles part of Scripture and I recently read through first Kings chapter 13 and it took me back to that conversation I had with my dad almost a whole year ago and I wanted to share it with you so this is the context of what's happening in first Kings chapter 13 there is a king his name is Jeroboam and he is leading the Lord's people but he's not leading them well he is making idols and he is offering sacrifices to these idols he is not doing what is pleasing in the eyes of the Lord so he is in he is living in sin but he's the king and so he is leading his people in sin as well and the Lord is just not happy about it and so God sends someone to come and denounce Jeroboam the king and let him know that what he's doing is not pleasing to the Lord and because he's living in this way this is gonna happen the messenger of the Lord shares like okay because you haven't been being obedient to the Lord these these things are going to take place so that's where we're at first Kings chapter 13 the man that God sends we never know his name but he's referred to a man of God so he comes to Bethel to tell Jeroboam like these these bad things are about to happen because you are being disobedient to the Lord and you're leaving his people and sin and after he delivers that message to Jeroboam starting in verse seven it then says then the king said to the man of God come to the palace with me and have something to eat and I will give you a gift but the man of God said to the king even if you gave me half of everything you own I would not go with you I would not eat or drink anything in this place for the Lord gave me this command you must not eat or drink anything while you are there and do not return to Judah by the same way you came so he left Bethel and went home another way ok so this is the message that God has given the man of God he says go deliver this message to Jeroboam for me but when you're there don't eat or drink anything and when you go back home to Judah do not go back home the same way by which you came to Bethel so this is a message that God has personally spoken to the man of God again we don't know his name but that's what he's referred to as verse 11 as this was happening there was an old prophet living in Bethel where Jeroboam and the man of God was and the old prophet sons came home and told him what the man of God had done in Bethel that day they also told their father what the man had said to the king the old prophet asked them which way did they go and so they showed their father like the road that the man of God had taken when he was leaving and the old prophet was like okay saddle my donkey I'm gonna go find him so the old prophet goes finds the man of God sitting under this great tree and he says are you the man of God from Judah and he said yes I am then he said to the man of God come home with me and and eat some food so ok again someone is approaching the man of God and asking him to do what God specifically told him not to do so the I've gotten initially response no I cannot I'm not allowed to eat or drink anything here in this place for the Lord gave me this command you must not eat or drink anything while you were there and do not return to Judah by the same way you came but the old prophet answered I am a prophet too just as you are and an angel gave me this command from the Lord bring him home with you so he can have something to eat and drink it then says but the old man was lying to him still the man of God went with him it says so they went back together and the man I've got ate and drank at the prophets home and what ends up happening is God sends a lion to kill the man of God because he was disobedient to what the Lord had told him pretty serious intense I know it but how how crazy rich and important this is to see that God had given the man of God a a very specific message when you go don't eat don't drink and come home a different way by which you came okay an old prophet seems awesome he seems like he would be speaking truthful things says but an angel the Lord told me you're supposed to do the exact opposite of what you're saying God told you and the man of God is like okay so we're gonna we're gonna go back and do what you're saying I should do friends again just like my dad said you're gonna hear many different voices from many different sources and it's gonna be people you know such as friends and family and teachers and then others are gonna be people from people you don't personally know such as like people on social media platforms people of high status that have a lot of subscribers a lot of followers just on big platforms and it's going to be easy sometimes to hear things that either make you feel good or hear things from people who you're like whoa they're famous or well they seem like they're doing pretty well or like it that like that makes sense that they would be saying that so I'm just gonna stick with it and go that's very very dangerous even if the person may be incredible we're all fickle we are all human we are all imperfect therefore the words that we speak are not going to be 100% true 100% of the time so it is so important that no matter who you're listening to no matter what status they have no matter how many followers they have or no matter how close you are to them I encourage you to take the words that you are hearing and hold it up to the light is the word of God sift it through the word and if it aligns it is truth it is credible but if it is not it is not truth and it is not dependable now the person who told me incredible I love them but if it doesn't align with God's Word I'm just not gonna take that advice to heart because it isn't solid it isn't solid and sometimes that voice may be your own voice I know sometimes that happens for me I'm either all up in my feelings or I'm talking to myself and act like cars and say wait in the wait I'm gonna go back to God's promises I'm gonna go back to God's truth and what I'm telling myself are the voices that I'm listening to is it aligning with what my God has told me because if not then it it's not gonna be something that is credible it's not gonna be something that is solid that I can stand on that's firm and I just want to share some scriptures with y'all so in Psalm 19 starting in verse 7 we hear the instructions of the Lord our perfect reviving the soul the decrees of the Lord are trustworthy making wise the simple the commandments of the Lord are right bringing joy to the heart the commands the Lord are clear giving insight for living reverence for the Lord is pure lasting forever the laws of the Lord are true each one is fair they are more desirable than gold even the finest gold they are sweeter than honey even honey dripping from the comb they are a warning to your servant a great reward for those who obey them if we keep going going back to Joshua chapter 1 verse 8 study this book of instruction what is the book of instruction the book of instruction is the Word of God study this word of God continually meditate on it day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in it only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do you'll so good someone weary blessed is the person who delights in God's award day and night for they will be like a tree planted by streams of water yields our fruit and season their leaves will never wither and everything they do prospers we read in 1st John 5 that those who love God obey his commands and his commands are not burdensome see the world will tell you the enemy will tell you that if you are following in accordance with God's Word then you're living a life enslaved you're living a life with no fun you're living a life restricted you're living a life of do's and don'ts type of religion and that could not be more twisted because it actually says that those who love God obey God and obey and God is not burdensome I don't obey God out of obligation from religion I obey God because I love him and because he's worthy of my obedience we know that the truth will set you free when you know the truth the truth will set you free Jesus he is the word we've read in John 1 in beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and if Jesus is the word in Matthew 11:28 through 30 Jesus says come to me jesus said if he's the word he said come to the word come to me all who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble at heart my yoke is easy and my burden it is light following the word it's following the Lord submitting to him it's not gonna be easy because the world is telling you the exact opposite but it's always worth it because we were literally designed to walk in relationship with him and because we're designed to walk in relationship with him walking in accordance to his word enables us to be fully who we were called to be if you read in acts 17 Oh friends this is so good okay so when acts 17 we read about Paul and Silas in Berea and they are preaching the gospel very respected men in accordance to the the fact that they are men of faith looked up to for that reason and starting in verse 11 it says the people of Berea they were more open minded than those in Thessalonica and they listened eagerly to Paul's message so Paul was preaching the gospel and they were in tune open minded ready to listen ready to learn but I love this they searched the Scriptures day after day to see if Paul and Silas were teaching the truth friends I love this Paul and Silas are awesome they're incredible they love God and they're wanting to lead other people in the love and truth of God as well yet even knowing that the people of Berea were still studying God's Word every day to see if what Paul and Silas were telling them was actually true I think we all should be more like the people of Berea everyday seeking the scriptures to test and see as what we're hearing from others is this actually aligning with what is true I was so good going back to the man of God in first Kings chapter 13 friends God gave him a word a person word and someone came and said you know and actually you can go and do this an angel of the Lord told me to actually tell you that you should go do this and instead of going back to the word that God had personally told him he deemed what he was told by someone else credible without holding it up to the light first and it led to destruction for him God wants to lead you in freedom and freedom comes from submitting to the word of God there will be again there will be people in your life there will be voices that you hear and that person that you hear from may be stellar but again people are fickle we screw up we are flawed but the Word of God 2nd Timothy 3:16 is breathed by him it has been made profitable for teaching correcting rebuking and training in righteousness Hebrews 4 we know that the Word of God it is alive and active sharper than any double-edged sword dividing soul and spirit joints and marrow judging the thoughts and the attitudes of the heart all that I am is laid before him nothing about me is hidden from his sight his word is a lamp to our feet a light to our path the grass withers the flowers fade but the Word of God stands forever you are so loved and you were designed to walk in alignment with his word his word will never his word is not burdensome his word is the same yesterday today and forever why because God is the same yesterday today and forever you mean so much to me but again you mean even more to the Lord I'm so thankful for you I'm so proud of you and I'm so inspired by you and I pray that this video just encouraged you in your own walk with the Lord and challenged you to take the voices that you were listening to and hold it up to the light that is the Word of God and if it does not align with the Word of God then it is not true it is not credible I still love the person who told me but I'm just not taking what they said to heart I'm taking what God says to heart be sure to give this video a thumbs-up share below how it encouraged you what other content you would like to be shared in the future and go follow me on the social first Corinthians 13 underscore love y'all mean so much to me and by sweet friends beautiful people welcome back to my channel I'm so so glad that you're here and I'm so thankful for you you are made in God's image for such a time as this fearfully and wonderfully did he make you his works are wonderful and I know this full well and every single day of your life was written in his book before a single one of them came to be you are so loved I'm so excited about today's message it will be a little shorter but I'm just really excited to share the word with you and I pray that it encourages you so something really cool that Josh and I started doing whenever we began dating is we chose a passage of scripture that we wanted to focus on for a certain season of our relationship so we started dating freshman year of college and we decided to focus on Ephesians 6 so many nights for the majority of that semester and some are leading up to sophomore year of college we would read Ephesians 6 at night and pray and it was just a way to continually focus on what is only up to our feet and a light to our path who is the Lord who are we in the Lord what is the Lord calling us to do remembering that it is only by remaining in him and he and us that our relationship will bear fruit it is only by remaining in his love that we can love one another well that we can minister and love others well that we can continue to live out an example of what God designed relationships to be not perfectly because we're human but in a godly way because we are seeking his face first and so it was a way to keep ourselves accountable a way to seek the Lord a way to keep his word at the focal point so it was so fun and then sophomore year college came around and we decided to read Psalm 91 and that has been our passage it still is and so many nights before saying goodnight and go into our separate homes we will read Psalm 91 and pray we seeking the Lord praying busing over our relationships praying blessings over our futures praying just anchor attitude to the Lord whatever God is putting on our heart we just come to the Lord in prayer after reading Psalm 19:1 and so I'm just gonna read this over you and I pray that it blesses you so so richly um because the Word of God is alive and active and then I want to share with you what has specifically encouraged me because again I have read Psalm 91 many times over the last year but a couple weeks ago I noticed something in this passage that I've never noticed before which is so beautiful and powerful to me because it again proves enough in Hebrews 4 that his word is alive and active he personally pursues us he personally speaks to us the Holy Spirit personally teaches us and reminds us of truth and you could read the same verse every single day of your life and the Lord continually reveals to you different angles of his heart continues to remind you of how faithful he is and that happened to me a couple weeks ago I noticed something in Psalm 91 that I have never noticed out of the hundred times that I have read it and I'm just excited to share it with you so but before I do that I just want to read it over you those who live in the shelter of the most high will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty this I declare about the Lord he alone is my refuge my place of safety he is my guide and I trust him for he will rescue you from every trap and protect you from deadly disease he will cover you with his feathers he will shelter you with his wings his faithful promises are your armor and tection do not be afraid of the terrors of the night nor the arrow that flies in the day do not dread the disease that stalks in darkness nor the disaster that strikes at midday though a thousand fall at your side though ten thousand are dying around you these evils will not touch you just open your eyes and see how the wicked are punished if you make the Lord your refuge if you make the most higher shelter no evil will conquer you no plague will come near your home for he will order his angels to protect you wherever you go they will hold you up with their hands so you won't even hurt your foot on a stone you will trample upon lions and cobras you will crush fierce lions and serpents under your feet the Lord says I will rescue those who love me I will protect those who trust in my name when they call on me I will answer I will be with them in trouble I will rescue and honor them I will reward them with a long life and give them my salvation the Lord is so good friends I love him he's so faithful and holy worthy of our praise so what popped out to me a couple weeks ago that I've never even noticed before that I want to share with you is in verse one notice the language that is used those who live in the shelter of the most high will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty it makes me think of John 3:16 where Jesus says for God so loved the world this is the whole world y'all for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son anyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life this is the hope of the world this the gospel is that Jesus came to live the perfect life we could not live died the death that we deserve because the wages of our sin is death he was buried in a tomb and three days later he rose from the grave defeating death defeating what separated us from him because he made us to be in relationship with him and now whoever believes in him Romans 8 nothing in all of creation could ever separate us from his love you all this hope is offered to anyone and everyone the whole world why because God so loved the whole world why because every human being in the world was made in God's image to be in relationship with him verse 1 those who live basically anyone who chooses to live in the shelter of the Most High is going to find rest rest for your soul rest for your body rest for your mind you will find rest in the Lord verse 2 this I declare about the Lord the language changes again because now the person writing this is taking ownership I'm gonna I decide I decide to declare about the Lord that he alone is my refuge my place of safety he is my god and I trust in him so he has heard the message that anyone who chooses to dwell in the shelter of the most high will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty and he says I want that I choose that I trust in him he's taken ownership we have the beautiful opportunity every single person on this planet had the OP we have the opportunity to trust in the Lord nobody can decide it for you nobody could decide it for me I get to decide whether or not I trust in God I trust in His Son Jesus that he is my Savior that he is the son of God but he was fully God fully man and I choose to receive his love and His salvation for my life and you get to decide whether or not you trust that - but what's so beautiful that it doesn't there yo this is why I make these videos because verse 3 the language changes again says for he will rescue you so it goes from those two I to you he will rescue you from every trap if you continue reading in verse 9 it says if you make the Lord your refuge if you make the most higher shelter and then it shares all the blessings that come from trusting in the Lord making him the lord of your life what I'm saying all of that to say is that God's love doesn't end with me but it continues with me the gospel the message of hope the message of life until you peace rest for our souls it's offered to anyone and everyone and when I choose to trust in him and believe in him and remain in him and hid he and me I can't keep that to myself I gotta go tell you about it and let you know hey if you make the Lord your knife use if you make the most high your shelter you too will find rest for your soul my love if you are a follower of the Lord don't keep such a hope to yourself because there's a world that is aching for this hope they were designed to walk in and as believers as the church we now are entrusted to be a continuation of his love jesus said it so well he said as I have loved you you now go love we get to go be his ambassadors we get to represent his heart to the world we get to represent his presence be a vessel of his presence to the world I'm not going in influencing making videos speaking to people loving people not on my own strength but resting in the one who is greater than I dwell in within the one who is the most high and because of that I have an energy that can't be shaken and I have a drive to be a vessel of hope that can't be stolen because it's it's not of the world friends I say all of this to simply encourage you that the love of God does not end with you it continues and with you you were made to walk with Him trust in him and remain in his love and therefore be a vessel of his love to a world that was made to walk in his love but don't know his love those who live the gospel is offered to anyone in every one but I choose to decide I decide that I trust in him he is my God and from a place of trusting in him his spirit living in me love Julie peace patience kindness goodness gentleness faithfulness self-control life is rich overflowing my cup I now can't help but go tell other people that hey verse 9 if you make the Lord your refuge if you make the most higher shelter you too will find rest for your soul the enemy will try to you in fear to steal your joy to water down your passion to not go and share this hope with the world second Timothy 1:7 you are not given a spirit of fear or timidity but rather spirit of power love and a sound mind Paul said in acts 20:24 my life is worth nothing to me unless I use it you're finishing the work assigned to me by Jesus the work of telling others the good news about the wonderful grace of God when I trusted him and taste and see how good he is I can't help but want to go and tell other people about it so that they too can experience this beauty and rest y'all are awesome I'm so thankful for you and I pray that this encouraged you y'all are just beautiful beautiful beautiful please subscribe and if you like this video

Instagram first Corinthians 13 underscore love y'all rock my socks bye friends in Philippians 2 Paul's talking about Jesus and starting in verse 6 he says though he was God he did not think of equality with God as something to cling to instead he gave up his divine privileges he took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being when he appeared in human form he humbled himself in obedience to God and died a criminal's death on a cross therefore God elevated him to the place of highest honor and gave him the name above all other names that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father you are my strength when I am weak you are the treasure that I seek    and seeking you as a precious jewel Lord to give her 5 d oh my see easy Oh    why is your name see Oh God    [Applause]    in taking my sin my cross my shame rising again I bless your

thankful for the Word of God and I'm so thankful that I get to share the Word of God with you today like we have so many things to be thankful for this morning I was reading through Psalm 103 verses 1 through 5 let all that i am praise the Lord with my whole being I will praise His Holy Name let all that i am praise the lord I will not forget all of his benefits all the good things he does that he was forgiven my sins but he is healed my disease all of my diseases that he has redeemed me from death and he has crowned me with love and his tender mercies that he fills my life with good things and my strength is renewed like the Eagles praise God I will rejoice in this day because this is the day that the Lord has made and I will rejoice in this day because I have the joy of talking to you and I am so thankful for it because you are a gift y'all I'm very excited about the message today very excited because the Word of God is just exciting I'm gonna be starting in John chapter 14 verse 27 Jesus is speaking and it's a couple of chapters before he's about to actually be crucified and so he's talking with his disciples warning them blessing them encouraging them but he's in all of it he's saying okay everything that I'm telling you it's not my words but it is the work of the Father in me and in the same way I pray that this video is the work of his Spirit in me to encourage you where you are meet you where you are and then motivate you to apply his word to your life as you go throughout your week um so starting in verse 27 again Jesus is speaking and he says to the disciples I am leaving you with a gift peace of mind and heart and the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give so don't be troubled or afraid okay this is what Jesus is saying he's saying I'm giving you this peace of mind peace of heart and I'm leaving it with you and it's not what the world can give you it's only what I can give you so don't be afraid don't let your heart be troubled but then if you continue in John chapter 16 verse 33 Jesus says I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me here on this earth you will have many troubles have many trials and sorrows and in other version it says you will have many troubles but take heart he says because I have overcome the world okay I just want to take a sweet moment and pause in these two verses alone because these two verses won't have been encouraging to me this week and that's what I wanted to share it with you because it was just on my heart Jesus says don't don't let your heart be troubled I give you peace of mind peace of heart not what the world can give it's what I give to you but then in verse 33 of chapter 16 he says in this world you're gonna have trouble but take heart because I have overcome the world whenever I read those two verses I hear a troubled world does not have to mean a troubled heart just kind of sit in that for a second our our world is ruled by the enemy the Prince of the air it's a fallen world many are walking in sin being obedient to the flesh and it's it's chaotic its troubled it's filled with sorrow it's filled with trials and Jesus is saying take heart I've overcome I give you peace that the world cannot give don't let your heart be troubled your heart does not have to be troubled even when the world is troubled there is a hope there and what is the hope what does it mean Wow I guess it's the way to ask how can I have a heart at peace whenever though I'm in a world that's troubled Jesus tells us at the end of verse 33 he says because I have overcome the world Jesus is the answer Jesus is our our source of peace he is our hope how sweet Isaiah 26:3 the Lord he says that I will keep in perfect peace those whose minds and are fixed on me and those who trust in me when we put our trust in God and we fix our thoughts on him we are filled with peace why because he is our hope he is a lord he is worthy of our attention and we were made to have our attention locked on him Colossians 3:15 let the peace of God roll in your heart as you are a member of his body and called to peace you were literally made to walk in peace that's why whenever you're walking in chaos you're walking in anxiety you're walking in fear you feel so weighed down and you don't feel like yourself because that is not how you were designed to walk you were designed you were called for peace Romans 8:28 I have this hope that God promises he will work all things together for the good of those who love him and are called according to his purpose how great of a hope revelation 21:4 Oh friends revelation 21:4 I just want to share it with you really quick says he will wipe away every tear from their eyes and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain all these things are gone forever whenever the Lord makes his home among us and whenever we are face to face with him for all of eternity in heaven for all believers John 3:16 God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life this hope 2nd Corinthians 4:18 fix your eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen because I know what is seen jesus said the sorrow the trials the troubles it's temporary but what is unseen is eternal I'm gonna keep my thoughts fixed on him who has called me I'm gonna fix my thoughts on him who has made me I'm gonna fix my thoughts on him who was in control the earth is the Lord's and everything in it I will find rest in my heart because he gives me a peace that the world simply cannot give my hope my joy my love my peace cannot be taken from the world because it was not given by the world a troubled world does not have to mean that you have a troubled heart Zephaniah 3:17 the Lord says he is the mighty warrior who saves he quiets there are different versions so the NLT version says he he quiets my fears with his love and rejoices over me sings over me with joyful songs how sweet I'm in the world but I'm not of it whenever I trusted in the Lord when I gave my life to him I am now sealed in his spirit his spirit lives in me never will he leave me never will he forsake me and I am no longer of this world I do not belong to the world and so therefore I do not have to have a troubled heart even whenever the world is troubled there's so much encouragement there and when in the midst of all the trouble Psalm 121 I lift my eyes up to the mountain I lift my eyes up to all the trouble that is surrounding me where does my help come from my help comes from the Lord the maker of heaven and earth he says take heart why why can't I take heart why can I have peace because he has overcome Romans 12:12 be patient in affliction joyful and hope be devoted to prayer his joy is my strength I can be joyful in this hope of eternity I can be joyful in this hope that he is he is the inker firm and secure in my soul and he will not permit the righteous to be shaken how how sweet he is Hebrews 11:1 faith is being confident what you hope for certain about what you can not see in second Corinthians 4:18 as I mentioned earlier set your eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen because what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal faith being confident what I hope for certain about what I can't see I may be seeing trouble right now but my hope is not in what I see my hope is in the one who's greater in me greater is he living in me than the enemy living in the world a troubled world does not have to mean a troubled heart praise God praise God for who he is Hebrews 10:38 Hebrews 10:23 now let us hold unswervingly to this hope why can we hold on to it why can why am i sharing this with you with such excitement and fully convinced because because he is who he says he is because he's overcome the world because I've tasted and seen how good the Lord is and I'm blessed as I take refuge in him and I am experiencing a peace that the world simply cannot provide in the midst of a world that it does not make sense to have peace I want you to be able to experience this piece as well and this piece only comes from the Lord because it's what the world cannot give a troubled world does not have to mean a troubled heart but what I think is so cool is to not be troubled does not mean that I do not care to be fully occupied with the joy of the Lord fully occupied with his spirit my eyes filled with just being captivated by his beauty his glory he how he is worthy of my praise when that is where my focus is my heart is not troubled by the chaos the deception the craziness of the world because I do not belong to the world my hope is of something greater but because I'm resting and the one who saved my soul because I'm resting in the one who is Lord who has overcome I'm then compelled by this love this peace this hope to be a vessel of this love this peace in this hope whenever I'm abiding in the Lord and he's abiding in me I'm able to empathize I'm able to love I'm able to listen I'm able to be caring in a way that I couldn't apart from his spirit because it's from a place of hope it's from the place of peace if I'm operating from a place of fear from a place of anxiety from a place of being troubled then how can I be a vessel of of peace a vessel of love a vessel of hope so to have a to not have a troubled heart does not mean that I don't care but to not have a troubled heart because I'm resting in the peace of the Lord means that I'm able to be a vessel of that peace in a way that I couldn't before we are the light of the world a city built on a hill that cannot be hid in the salt of the earth ambassadors ambassadors of Christ a representation of his heart of his character to the whole world that he so loves I'm able to mourn with those who mourn rejoice with those who rejoice meet people where they are but love them too much to leave them there I'm compelled to walk alongside people and love people well why because as I said before I've tasted and seen I've experienced the Lord do that with me the Lord has met me where I was he gave me peace the world couldn't give he encouraged me in the hope that was an anchor firm and secure in my soul and now I simply can't keep it to myself and I want to go into a broken hurting troubled world dark world fallen world and be who God has called me to be by being a vessel of him to bless people and bring him glory do not be troubled does not mean to no longer care but rather now in Christ I care from a place of his care and this directs my focus to what really matters bringing him glory and blessing people in a troubled world my love be encouraged a troubled heart does not have to happen because you're in a troubled world but you can actually have peace in the midst of a troubled world and therefore live in all-caps live out loud on purpose intentionally who God has called you to be compelled by his spirit with an undivided heart out of fear for him to love people to bless people how sweet how sweet is he his love doesn't end with us but it continues with us I'm just gonna say it again to encourage you a troubled world does not have to mean a troubled heart and that can only be your reality that you walk out that you live out right now my trust in Jesus he said in this world you're gonna have trouble but take heart how can I take heart he said because I have overcome rest in this promise friends I love you so much God loves you so much comment down below of how you were encouraged something you learned content that you'd like to see moving forward give it a thumbs up if you weren't encouraged and go and follow me on Instagram first Corinthians 13 underscore love and don't forget how loved you are by sweet people hey fellow folks MMH Injuns here thank you so much for coming on over to the channel I love you you are so significant and your life is worth celebrating I'm so thankful that you're here the verse that I'm really excited to just focus in on today that will lead us to other verses but this will be our main verse today is found in proverbs chapter 27 verse 7 and I'm gonna be reading out of the NLT version and it says a person who is full refuses honey but even bitter food tastes sweet to the hungry I'm gonna read that one more time a person who is full refuses honey but even bitter food tastes sweet to the hungry so whenever I first read that something that may come to mind is the thought that okay I know that whenever I'm full it doesn't matter how yummy food looks on a table I'm already satisfied I'm already content it could be the sweetest dessert ever and I know that like even if I eat it I wouldn't enjoy it because I'm already full like I'm fused to eat that because I'm content I'm satisfied I'm full there's no more room for anything else but as you continue says but even bitter food tastes sweet to the hungry so if I'm starving there could be something on the table in front of me something on my plate right in front of me that I hate like my least favorite foods on a plate but I would be willing to eat it because I'm so hungry I'm gonna read this verse again a person who is full refuses honey but even bitter food tastes sweet to the hungry whenever I am filled with the Holy Spirit when I was completely content completely satisfied in the Lord then it no matter how sweet of a plate the world offers me it's not going to look appetizing because I'm already filled like I'm already full but like I got money I have I have peace I'm filled with hope I'm filled with love I've built with joy I'm filled with acceptance and adoration I'm sealed in his approval in his spirit but if I don't know how loves I am if I don't know where peace is if I don't have hope if I'm trying to find place a place of acceptance anywhere I can get it the world could offer it to me in the most least appetizing way before me but if I am empty and starving for acceptance starving for love starving for approval starving for peace then even if it's the worst offer that the world could give which will leave me thirsty again will leave me hungry again I'm willing to take it it could be so bitter but I'm willing to take it because I'm hungry I'm hungry for it and it's all I know a person who is full refuses honey but even bitter food tastes sweet to the hungry Psalm 23 in verse 1 it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want another version says the Lord is my shepherd in him I like no good thing in him I'm full verse 5 it says the Lord overflows my cup he overflows my cup with his presence because when I'm filled with my spirit when I'm filled with his spirit my body is his home I'm filled with his presence I'm fully satisfied his peace rules in my heart because I'm a member of his body and called to beasts like that I am filled Paul prays over the Church of Ephesus and in Ephesians 1:18 I pray that your hearts may be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident out that you having the Lord what it'd like that's who God is he's the overflowing lack no good thing flooded type of God I am fully content fully satisfied so it doesn't matter house to need of an offer the world gives I'm going to refuse it because I know that it's only in the Lord I actually like no good thing Psalm 103 the Lord fills my life with good things but all that i am praise the Lord with my whole heart I will praise His Holy Name and forget not all of his benefits that he satisfied my deepest hunger in John 4 13 through 14 Jesus is talking to the Samaritan woman at the well and we just share what he is what he said to her this is in verse 13 jesus replied anyone who drinks this water will soon become thirsty again and he's referring to the water that's in the well that she would go at the middle of the day to draw water from the well he said anyone who drinks this water the water that the earth that the world can provide you're gonna be thirsty again verse 14 but those who drink the water I get Jesus says we'll never be thirsty again it becomes a fresh bubbling spring within them giving them eternal life so God's like the world's gonna offer you things that look appetizing the world's gonna offer you things that say they're gonna fill you the words the world is going to offer you things that they may satisfy you but it's not gonna satisfy you long-term but he says what I give you you'll never be thirsty again you'll refuse the sweetest offers from the world because you like it says in Psalm 34:8 I've tasted and seen that the Lord is good and you were blessed as you take refuge in him Jesus says again in John 6:35 he says I am the bread of life whoever comes to me will never be hungry again whoever believes in Me will never be thirsty we lack no good thing proverbs 4:23 says guard your heart all outs for everything that you do flows from it just like how what I eat like what how I feel my body physically it determines the type of energy that I have it determines the like how strong I am at a turn it did like it determines a lot the type of food that I feel my body with and in the same way the food just is the food that I eat will determine the strength I have and the appetite that I develop that applies spiritually as well where I'm finding my peace where I'm finding my acceptance where I'm finding my hope and my love how I'm feeling that desire deep within me it's gonna determine the strength that I have and it's gonna determine the appetite that I develop so if I keep going to the world to fuel my desire to be loved and wanted and accepted and seen and valued well then that's gonna reflect in my strength my strength is gonna continually be weary and burdened because the world is going to continually let me down I'll go on highs feel accepted whenever someone comments that I'm beautiful feel accepted whenever someone like I have a good conversation with somebody feel accepted whenever someone fill in the blank but people are fickle in this world we will have trouble but Jesus said take heart I've overcome the world Jesus says in me you'll never go hungry you'll never go thirsty because of me you like no good thing come taste and see that I am good be blessed as you take refuge in me and me you have peace you have joy you have acceptance you have love that cannot be taken away from you and so whenever you go to the Lord and are led by his Spirit and are filled with a desire for him your energy will begin to reflect that his joy is now my strength his peace is now what keeps me steady and calm how powerful is that his love casts out my fear that's the strength I'm running on I'm running on the strength now that His grace is sufficient for me and his power is made perfect in my weaknesses so I can boast all the more gladly in my weaknesses like how how three when I know this truth I am set free from feeling as though I have to feel my desire from a world that cannot feel it the way it wasn't the way that I was made to be fueled when I am filled with the spirit and filled with focus on the Lord and nourished by his word then even the things that seem most appetizing offered by the world will be nothing in comparison to the meal that the Lord has offered a person who is full refuses honey but even bitter food tastes sweet to the hungry so what I fuel myself with I'll begin to build an appetite for so if I begin to fill up fuel myself with what the world offers my appetite will grow for what the world offers and things that the world offers is everyone's wearing that so I guess I have to wear that too to be cool I have to wear that to to be accepted I have to wear that to to be thought of a certain way the things the world offers is doing things in romantic relationships that everyone does because that's how I'm gonna get loved that's how I'm gonna be told I'm beautiful things the world offers is watching and listening to what everyone is watching and listening thinks the road off earth is feeding on jealousy in comparison feeding on control feeding on approval from people feeding on pride feeding on what feels good in the moment and again those things have their highs I'll feel full for a little while that I'll get hungry again why because I was made to be loved I was made to walk in peace I was made to walk in relationship I was made to walk in community I was made to walk in hope but if I'm building up an appetite to find those things in the world I'm going to constantly be let down just Jesus says if you drink from this well you're gonna keepin you're gonna keep gettin thirsty he said but come to me y'all were called to feed on Christ in him were fully satisfied and in him we never go go hungry we were made by him and for him so looking anywhere but him for satisfaction will always fall short those who are full refuse honey but those who are hungry they eat even the bitter things and the bitter things taste sweet to them I invite you to search your heart and those desires that God put in you those desires to be loved to be accepted to be seen to be confident to have peace those are beautiful things God put those things in you but where you go to seek for those appetites to be satisfied that's a big decision because going to the world is gonna leave you hungry again it's gonna leave you discontent it's gonna leave you unsatisfied and it is gonna fuel energy to you but it's not going to be energy that lasts because it's from a world that's troubled is from people that are fickle but if you go to the Lord says in Romans 8 that when our minds are governed by his spirit we are led in life and peace when I go to the Lord to fuel that appetite I'm able to rest in the fact that I'm loved by God Wow he is my peace that surpasses all understanding his love casts out all fear what people think of me in him I like no good thing taste and see that the Lord is good blessed are you who takes refuge in him I pray this is my prayer for you this week that you would be so filled with his spirit so filled with satisfaction from his word so filled with the hope that he gives so filled with the love that he so passionately has for you that he died on a cross rose again so that you may have life if you believe in him and put your trust in him that that will quench every thirst that you have and it will satisfy every hunger that you have continuing in that verse even bitter food tastes sweet to the hungry you notice that the things that the world offers to try and meet those eternal desires it's actually bitter in comparison to how good the meal that Christ offers is so sweet and then this meal is so good that you can't help but share it with people taste and see that the Lord is good and then I I just had such a good meal you better believe it I'm telling everybody about this meal I just ate this meal of hope and peace and love and joy that never runs out ever and it's offered to you there's a seat at the table but you get to decide whether or not you sit down and you eat the meal that the Lord is offering to you that the world simply can't provide God wants to give me something deeper he wants to give you love that never fails hope that's an anchor firm and secure and peace that simply cannot be taken from the world because the world didn't give it y'all are awesome y'all are so love then I pray that you may be filled with the Lord so that even the sweetest things that are offered to you that aren't from him you refuse it you refuse it you are so loved I pray that you'll have the best week ever comment down below how you were encouraged what content you'd like to see moving forward give this video a thumbs up and go follow me on the social first greenbeans 13 underscored love y'all rock my socks bye everyone beautiful people what is up welcome to the youtube channel with mma jenkins i love you and i am so thankful that you're here and i truly think that you are the bee's knees the height of excellence and yet you matter so much to god and i am so excited to be able to share with you what god has shared with me but before we get into the message i want to acknowledge the fact that our setting looks a little different so the jenkins family is currently moving across town and so my bed my nightstand desk and dresser have all been sold so we are currently sitting in the floor right now where normally we would be sitting at my desk but i think that that's so beautiful because it kind of aligns with our message today actually because our message today is praising god always praising him no matter the circumstance praising him no matter the season praising him all the time and so whether we're sitting at my desk or i have my phone propped up in a chair and i'm sitting on the floor we're praising god and excited to get in his word because he's that awesome and we have that much to be grateful for so let's get into it i'm really really excited so when i was like five years old or so that was when me and my mom started getting our nails done together like that's just kind of been one of our things but starting in high school god put it on my heart to find messages that aligned with the colors that i was getting on my nails and that provided a gateway for me to share his word his heart with people so whether it was i was really excited about a color and once i got that color i found a message to align with that color or i had a message on my heart and so when i went to get my nails done i found a color that aligned with that message regardless god would always place a message on my heart and not only did it minister to me personally like every time i look at my nails i'm reminded of that message but also it provided a great opportunity to share god's heart with people so like girls talk about nails and so if anywhere i'm out and about like i'll have often people come up and say hey i love your nails and i can either say like thank you so much do you want to know like why i got this color or thank you so much like i actually got this color because yada yada yada and therefore be able to share christ with them so really really cool and i recently got this color and it's like in between a coral and a um like burnt orange it's like right there in in between and whenever i saw it i was like wow this is a color that is normally most of the time found in a sunrise and in a sunset and when thinking through that i was like oh my goodness psalm 113 3 which says from the rising of the sun to its setting the name of the lord is to be praised and in another version it says everywhere from east to west praise the name of the lord everywhere no matter where you are praise the name of the lord why because he is so worthy of our praise i looked up on the google the definition of praise and it means the expression of approval or admiration of someone or something and what i love is that my praising of the lord is not determined by the circumstance that i'm walking through or the season that i'm currently in but my praise to the lord is determined upon his character and his holiness his worthiness how he is steadfast i just like strong warning do not let your circumstance your feelings the season that you're walking through be the ultimate determining factor of whether or not you express express approval and admiration and praise to the lord but rather may his holiness and his worthiness of being praised be the determining factor of you praising the lord because he's always worthy of our praise always from the rising of the sun to its setting the name of the lord is to be praised and so i want to share some verses with y'all that like i just got so excited about as the psalmist talk about praising the lord in psalm 150 oh and before i read that um just for any of y'all's amazing selves who want to know um i'm reading from the nlt version in case anybody was interested to know that um so psalm 150 praise the lord praise god in his sanctuary praise him in his mighty heaven praise him for his mighty works praise his unequaled greatness his greatness cannot be matched there's no one like him praise him with a blast of the ram's horn praise him with the lear and harp praise him with the tambourine and dancing praise him with strings and flutes praise him with a clash of symbols praise him with loud clinging symbols let everything that breathes everything that breathes sings sing praises to the lord praise the lord and psalm 147 oh i love this y'all it says praise the lord and then continuing in verse 1 this is probably one of my favorites how good to sing praises to our god how delightful and how fitting that's really one of my like favorite phrases ever that it is fitting to praise the lord when i am praising the lord and my focus is on him and i am expressing my approval and my admiration to the lord it is the greatest satisfaction and wholeness that i've ever felt like no experience that the world could ever offer matches the experience of praising the lord because in ecclesiastes 3 god says that he planted eternity within every single human heart it is only him who can meet that deepest need because he made us to be in relationship with him and he wired us to praise him therefore it makes sense that it is fitting to praise him in psalm 22 we read oh this is awesome in psalm 22 we read that god is enthroned upon our praise that's wild he is enthroned upon our praise in hebrews 13 15 we hear that we are called to continually offer a sacrifice of praise to god proclaiming our allegiance to his name that means all the time again don't let your circumstance be the determining factor of whether or not you praise god but may his holiness his worthiness his character be the determining factor of whether or not you praise him and that means you always praise him because he's always worthy his worthiness never changes so steadfast he's so good job he demonstrated this in a very beautiful way in job one his kids are killed his servants are killed his animals are stolen farm hands are killed like there's a lot that is stripped away from his life and in job 1 verse 21 listen to how powerful or even starting in verse 20 after being told all of this that his kids are killed his like his animals have been killed his servants have been killed like and his animals have been stolen like all these things this is his response okay verse 20 job stood up and tore his robe in grief that's powerful he's honest about how he feels to express your approval and admiration to the lord does not mean to disregard how you legitimately feel but i think it actually i've said this before but it speaks a greater volume to how worthy god is of our praise because it shows wow that person is experiencing deep grief but they are so in love with their god and their god must be so real and faithful that they praise him in the midst of feeling that much grief so to praise god does not mean to disregard how you feel but to praise god means that your your feelings are not the determining factor of whether or not you praise him no matter what i'm feeling i'm compelled to take it to him and praise him so good that's what job does he's honest about where he's at he doesn't fake it pretend like everything's okay verse 20 job stood up and tore his robe in grief then he shaved his head and fell to the ground to worship verse 21 he said i came naked from my mother's womb and i will be naked when i leave the lord gave me what i had and the lord has taken it away praise the name of the lord praise the name of the lord always i continually offer sacrifices of praise to god because he's always worthy of my approval and my admiration the lord is taken away the lord has given no matter what happens from the rising of the sun to its setting he is worthy blessed be the name of the lord praise the name of the lord i love in psalm 34 2 i'm just sharing a lot of scripture with y'all because scripture talks so much about praising the lord psalm 34 2 says i will boast only in the lord let all who are helpless take heart so the things that i boast in it's all about him because he's worthy he's worthy of my boasting he's worthy of my praise he's worthy of my approval he's worthy of my admiration he is always worthy of our praise even when we don't feel like it or our circumstances don't com or our cir our circumstances communicate to us that praises that to god don't make sense he is still worthy so i wrote this down in my notes as i was just preparing for this video and so i'm going to read it again and just pray that it encourages you he is always worthy of our praise even when we don't feel like it or our circumstances communicate to us that praises to god don't make sense he is still worthy holy holy holy is the lord god almighty who was and is and is to come it's proverbs 3 trust in the lord with all of your heart don't lean on your own understanding but in all of your ways submit to him he will make your path straight there'll be things i walk through that i don't understand there'll be things that i walk through that i don't like there'll be things i walk through that are so good and sweet mountain top moments that i don't want to end and there will be everything in between and through it all he's worthy of my praise because of who he is i choose to praise him even when i don't understand even when i'm surrounded by chaos even when i don't feel like it i'm recent i'm i'm reading through isaiah a lot right now and oh friends it's so good i've never read through isaiah all the way before and so i'm like loving it but in isaiah chapter 7 god says something really cool so like him and i had to just highlight and underline and share with you so there is a king named king ahaz and he's like very afraid right now because there are two kings that are coming to attack him and so he's really afraid and god sends isaiah to come and share a message from the lord to king ahaz this is what god tells isaiah to tell king a has starting in verse 4 of chapter 7 tell him to stop worrying tell him he doesn't need to fear the fierce anchor of those two burnt out embers king resin of syria and pekka son of vermalia those were the two kings coming to attack him verse 5 this is what god says yes the kings of syria and israel are plotting against him saying we will attack judah and capture it for ourselves then we will install the son of tibial as judas king so he's saying yes like i acknowledge the chaos that you're in i acknowledge the troubled circumstances that you are walking through i acknowledge that there are kings who are coming to destroy you like i'm not gonna water down like the fact that this is happening i'm not gonna water down what you're probably feeling right now god's like no i see you i hear you i acknowledge you okay but this is what the sovereign lord says he says this invasion will never happen it will never take place for syria is no stronger than its capital damascus and damascus is no stronger than its king resin as for israel within 65 years it will be crushed and completely destroyed israel is no stronger than its capital samaria and samaria is no stronger than its king pekka son over malia unless your faith is firm i cannot make you stand firm i feel like that's a whole other message in itself but what i loved about that is again don't let your circumstance be the determining factor of whether or not you praise the lord but trust in the lord with all of your heart lean not on your own understanding but in all of your ways submit to him for he will make your path straight god says yes i acknowledge that right now what you're probably understanding can create fear but i the sovereign lord say don't lean on your own understanding because i'm going to take care of you again what are we seeing his character we're seeing his holiness we're seeing his faithfulness we're seeing his worthiness so no matter what season you're walking through whether it be the best season you've ever experienced or it'd be probably one of the most difficult seasons you've ever experienced and as a lot of us are walking through this pandemic happening figuring out uncertainties and fears and isolation tons of stuff happening and then we're experiencing so much unjustice being exposed and loudly communicated there's a lot going on in our world right now and god says yes i acknowledge that this is happening but i the sovereign lord say that i am worthy of your praise don't stop praising me because your circumstances have changed don't stop praising me because fill in the blank because he's always worthy of our praise and i believe that we can respond to whatever situation in front of us the best whenever we're coming from a place of praise to the lord that's my last point with y'all from the rising of the sun to its setting the name of the lord is to be praised intentionally praising the lord overflows into how i treat others if i am seeking to praise the lord then i am seeking to do what pleases him because i love him again if i let my circumstances determine whether or not i praise him i'm in a pickle but if i let his character determine whether or not i praise him then that means i am praising him always and that's going to overflow into how i respond to situations whether it be situations of a pandemic situations of injustice situations of fear uncertainty chaos you name it i'm going to be able to respond from a place of being compelled by his love from a place of desiring to please him and love his people from a place of praising god because he's always worthy of our praise i have never regretted a decision i made when it came from praising the lord y'all i love you from the rising of the sun to its setting may the name of the lord be praised y'all be blessed and have a good day and don't forget how awesome you are be sure and go follow me on instagram first corinthians 13 underscore love also i just released a new podcast called the have you heard podcast and it is on apple and spotify so be sure to subscribe rate review um and if you have not gotten your devotional book copy of all caps you that is available at barnes noble and on amazon y'all are awesome be sure and subscribe to this channel if you have not yet and comment below on how you were encouraged and content that you would like to see moving forward y'all are the best bye everyone you hi everybody welcome back to my channel this is mma jenkins here and i love you so much and i'm so thankful for your life and i am so grateful for the opportunity to get to talk with you to get to go to god's word with you and if you've seen other videos of mine you'll notice that we are in a different location than normal um my family is moving and we will be out of our house in a matter of days into our new house which is so exciting and i'll probably do a video on that later and what god is teaching me in it but because of that i am currently in our workout room as we are moving boxes and um getting ready to transition also something super fun and special about this video is that this month i'm partnering with day spring and if you have not heard of day spring yet i'm so thankful you are hearing about them today because they are definitely a company that you want to be in the loop on so they are a christian resource company and y'all their mission is to help people experience the life-changing love of christ they are incredible i love them dearly and getting to partner with them is just so much fun but this year they have a particular focus and that is god's love over all else and each month they have a different theme within that umbrella of god's love over all else and this month i have the joy of partnering with them in the theme love speaks and so that's what our message is on today that love speaks and what does it look like to speak the truth in love so i'm really really excited our main verse that we're going to be focusing on today is ephesians 4 15 which says we will speak the truth in love growing in every way more and more like christ who is the head of his body the church and what's really cool is the verse right before it is paul is speaking to the church of ephesus and he says then we will no longer be immature like children we won't be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching we will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth then he transitions to verse 15 which we just read that says instead we will speak the truth in love growing in every way more and more like christ and so what's really cool is that every moment we get to choose we get to choose if we will like paul is speaking be influenced by people who are speaking lies or we can choose to speak lies or we can choose to speak from a place of fearing people and trying to please people and watering down the truth so that people won't quote unquote be offended because they're hearing something that they disagree with or we can choose to speak the truth in love and we don't do it perfectly because we're human but we get the opportunity every day to seek christ and like paul said instead we will we get to choose to speak the truth in love growing in every way more and more like christ i'm so thankful that god promises to finish the good work that he started in us like we get to grow more and more like christ every day that's just so sweet so that is our theme verse of today ephesians 4 15 instead we will speak the truth in love growing more and more like christ um who is the head of his body the church and so i want to start off by addressing like what does it mean to speak the truth in love and when thinking through that question i wanted to simply share scripture with you of what that looks like what god tells us that looks like so following our verse of ephesians 4 15 that we will choose to speak the truth and love becoming more and more like christ i also found these verses ephesians 4 29 paul says don't use foul or abusive language let everything you say be good and helpful so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them the niv version says don't let any unwholesome words come out of your mouth but only what is helpful for building others up so that it may benefit those who listen next verse is second corinthians 5 14 where paul basically says we are compelled by the love of christ like when you have been saved by grace through faith alone in christ and it's not by your own work so you can't boast but it's a gift from god and you're walking in that redemption you're walking in that salvation and you're becoming like we read earlier more and more like christ you can't help but be compelled by his love when you know him authentically and so paul addresses that we are compelled by the love of christ and in first corinthians 13 verses 4 through 8 paul actually goes into what love is he says love is patient love is kind it is not self-seeking it doesn't boast it is not proud it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs love does not delight in evil but it rejoices in the truth love always protects always hopes always trust always perseveres love never fails and in first john 4 19 we read that we love because christ first loved us so that goes back to what paul said in second corinthians 5 14 that we are compelled by the love of christ i love because he first loved me i don't love because someone else treated me well i don't love because someone else gave me reason to i love from a place of being loved it's unconditional because god's love for me is unconditional i can love other people without strings attached without an agenda it's pretty powerful i love how the lord talks about it in luke 6 27-28 he said i tell you you've you've been told to love those who love you back he said but anybody can do that very truly i tell you to love your enemies bless those who curse you pray for those who persecute you you see the love of god it doesn't have conditions so when i'm living a life compelled by his love i can love people regardless of who they are regardless of how they treat me regardless of their response regardless of their status i love them because christ is my standard and he first loved me and when i'm compelled by that i can't help but love them and something else that i wanted to address is how do you know when you're speaking the truth so the bible talks about like what does it mean to speak the truth in love how do you know you're speaking the truth how can you be confident that you are sharing honestly with people like sharing things with people that are foundational and solid and things that they can actually stand on and i think again we're going to go back to scripture and that kind of hits home this point and that is that jesus is the truth in john 14 6 jesus says i am the way the truth and the life and no one comes to the father except through me and in john 8 32 jesus says you will know the truth and the truth will set you free and in john 1 we hear that in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and in a couple verses down we read that the word became flesh and dwelt among us so jesus is the word and we read that he is truth so that we we know the word is truth and we also know that jesus from hebrews 13 is the same yesterday today and forever so the word is truth and the truth is steadfast never changes so i'm going to take what i want to say and hold it up to god's word i'm going to hold it up to the light psalm 119 105 says that his word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path that his light shines in the darkness and the darkness cannot overcome it so i'm going to take the words that i want to speak and hold it up to his light and let him expose what is legit and what is faulty because from his word i can know what is true second timothy 3 16 we hear that all scripture is god breathed it has been made profitable for teaching correcting rebuking and training in righteousness so that you may be prepared for every good work one of those things is you may be prepared to speak the truth in love isaiah 55 we're reminded of how powerful god's word is that it does not return void that just as the rain falls from the heavens it does not return back to the heavens until providing nourishment causing budding and flourishing to happen among the earth so is it that god's word does not leave his mouth and return back to him until fulfilling the purpose for which he sent it to accomplish i also want to share this verse with you that i think is really cool it's in matthew 24 verse 35 and jesus says heaven and earth will disappear but my words will never disappear how do i know i'm speaking truth i'm gonna hold it up to god's word because it is steadfast it is truth and it never changes psalm 19 oh this is one of my favorites friends i just had to put a bookmark here so i could simply read it to you a portion of psalm 19 david is speaking about god's word about the law and he says the instructions of the lord are perfect reviving the soul the decrees of the lord are trustworthy making wise the simple the commandments of the lord are right bringing joy to the heart the commands of the lord are clear giving insight for living so god gives me clarity when i go to his word i know clearly what is true reverence for the lord is pure lasting forever the laws of the lord are true and each one is fair they are more desirable than gold even the finest gold they are sweeter than honey even honey dripping from the comb they are a warning to your servant a great reward for those who obey them so along with prayer and community surrounding yourself with with godly people who you can go and seek advice from and speak things out so that you can speak truth in it into it together talking with the lord continually i encourage you to take the words that you are being eager to speak take it and hold it up to the light because god's word is truth like the winds may come and blow and the storms may crash in but the person who built his house on the solid rock it will not fall it will not be shaken so whenever you build your life whenever you build your perspective from god's word the words that you speak are going to be filled with truth because it's a solid foundation from which you're building how powerful so then you can sit down with people who disagree with you you can sit down with people who have different perspectives have different opinions and learn from them and and be quick to listen and slow to speak and slow to become angry and hear things that you're like wow i never thought about that before all the while you're filtering it through what you know to be true because his word is a solid foundation i love how whenever you continue in that thought of like okay i want to speak the truth in love how do i know that what i'm speaking is true well i'm gonna go to god's word ephesians 4 32 kind of continues that thought process for me when i think like okay how do i know i'm speaking the truth okay i take it to the word well then how do i speak the truth in love so we've talked about what what does it mean to speak the truth in love how do i know i'm speaking truth incredible well how do i actually apply those things i hear those things but how do i put those things to action how do i speak the truth in love and in ephesians 4 32 i love how paul says be kind to each other tenderhearted forgiving one another just as god through christ has forgiven you in first samuel 16 7 i love how the lord says listen i the lord don't look at the things the way that people look at them or people look at the outward appearance but god says i look at the heart and so a question that i have for you is when you're wondering like how do i speak the truth in love am i speaking the truth in love i know i'm speaking like what i know to be true but how do i know if it's coming from a place of genuine and authentic love i encourage you to ask yourself why are you speaking what you're speaking and i wrote down a list of questions are you speaking to win the argument are you speaking to sound smart are you speaking to prove someone wrong are you speaking from a place of care for that person or are you speaking because you want to see that person walk in freedom if you're speaking to win an argument prove someone wrong sound smart just hear your own voice then i would take a step back and be quick to listen because there may be a motive in your heart that is not coming from love but whenever you give like ask the lord god search my heart and know me test me and know my anxious thoughts see if there's any offensive way in me and leave me in the way everlasting and if you genuinely want to sit down and listen with someone and speak just speak truth into their life because you care for them and you want to see them walk in freedom and you love them enough to be honest with them and hear their story and listen and give advice if it's asked for it like then that's from a place of love luke 6 45 says that your mouth speaks from that which fills your heart if your heart is occupied with love that is compelled by christ with love because he first loved you then from your mouth will speak as paul said in verse 32 of chapter four in ephesians it will come from a place of kindness it will come from a tender heart it will come from a place of forgiveness just as god forgave you loved you and was tenderhearted and compassionate towards you it will overflow proverbs 4 23 says guard your heart above all else for everything that you do flows from it so ask yourself those questions why am i wanting to speak right now your heart is proud then you will speak to focus the attention on you with the words that you say if your heart is fearful then you will speak to focus the attention on keeping everyone happy walking on eggshells worrying about stepping on toes but if your heart is compelled by love then the focus is on christ and therefore you're wanting the best for the other person and you're wanting the best for the other person enough to speak the truth and to listen all from a place of love and in this season of fear and chaos and sickness in this world of darkness and hatred this is really important i believe that this because god's word is steadfast and rains true um no matter what season we're in i think that this is something all of us can grow in as as we read at the beginning we will speak the truth in love growing in every way more and more we all have areas to grow and i think this is a very precious season to lean into this truth of how do we speak the truth in love second corinthians 5 14 i'm going to be compelled by the love of christ first john 4 we read that perfect love casts out all fear you know that our world is filled and occupied with fear right now so what if we were compelled by the love of christ and what is this love that god demonstrated his perfect love for us and that while we were still sinners christ died for us he came and lived the perfect life that none of us could live he died the death that we deserve because that's what our sin cost was death that was the debt that we had to pay and he paid for it he took our place he was buried in a tomb and three days later he rose from the grave and anyone who believes in him shall never perish and we shall never be separated from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord this is the love that i'm compelled by as children of god we are ambassadors of love himself and god makes his appeal through us matthew 5 14 we are the light of the world continuing on through verse 16 a city on a hill that cannot be hidden just as a person puts a lamp in the house it doesn't put a bowl over the lamp no it puts it on its stand so that it provides light to the whole house and in the same way let your light so shine before all people so that they may see your good works and glorify your father who is in heaven you were made for such a time as this fearfully and wonderfully you were given gifts and talents so strategically god has marked out the boundaries of your lands before you even came here and i'm so so thankful for you and so excited about your life and i pray that this video truly encourages you about what does it mean to speak the truth in love how do i know that i'm speaking truth how do i know or how do i how do i speak the truth in love and wow what an incredible opportunity with the season that we're in to put that into practice and understand that i'm not gonna do it perfectly but i'm growing as paul's ahead in verse 15 of chapter four instead we will speak the truth in love growing more and more like christ who is the head of his body the church friends i love you thanks for tuning in with me today and i wanted to share some last

lord together you all mean the world to me and i pray you have the best day go speak the truth and love bye y'all you hello incredible people welcome back to my channel i am mma jenkins and i love you so much i'm so pumped and thankful because i have finally moved into a home with my three best friends and it's so sweet it is a cherished season the last season before being married and with with my girls and it's just going to be a special year but i have my room all finished and moved into and decorated and i wanted to share some of the sweet things about it that make me smile and so i pray that this video is just a breath of fresh air to your day that you're encouraged and it brings that beautiful smile of yours out um and that you just know how much the lord loves you and that this is a reminder of that friends i'm excited let's do it woohoo so whenever you walk into the room you notice that it's small and quaint and that's probably one of my favorite parts because it gives such cozy vibes and i've noticed that having a smaller room makes cleaning it a lot faster because you can only make so big of a mess um but this mirror is so fun it i call it my beauty and the beast mirror um i need to clean her a little bit she's got some smudges but yes i got her on facebook marketplace and she just gives me the bell vibes and i love her and i decided to take my door off of my closet because i felt like it just opened up this space to put my ladder here and to i'll make it a little wider so y'all can see it put my ladder here and my in jesus name amen sign and i just got all of all of this cool stuff the rod and the the little hook and the curtain at target so anytime i do want to close it i can but gives it more of a boho vibe you know what i'm saying and this is probably one of my like most cherished and tender parts of the room because it's my people wall it's my people and inspo wall i've got my man i've got my fam and i've got my girls and wow just whenever i look at these pictures i am so very much reminded of god's faithfulness and how guys we are not made to do life alone solomon said it in ecclesiastes in ecclesiastes 4 he said woe to the man who falls and has no one to pick him up for we were made to do life together in proverbs 27 17 just as iron sharpens iron one man sharpens another we were made to do life hand in hand championing each other on to see one another become all of who god has called us to be wow and then this quote i saw it at a boutique and i was like oh yes and it's by oscar wilde it says to live is the rarest thing in the world most people exist that is all and it goes in line with my book all caps you if you have not ordered that i will put the link below so that you can definitely order your copy but all caps you this quote all of it reminds me of john 10 10 where we hear the thief has come to steal to kill and destroy but jesus says i have come so that you may have life and have it abundantly we were made to live in all caps we were made to live in freedom to the fullest the way that god originally designed us to by the power of his spirit not merely exist and waste our way through our days and this here is my little my little plant her name is penelope i was timid and saying little because she's actually quite quite big and i call her penny for short and low-p for whenever her leaves are sad but good thing i have not had to call her lopey yet because she's doing pretty good y'all which i'm really excited this is like my first plant and and it's going pretty well i love her and whenever i look at her i'm just reminded of a lot i'm reminded of a lot of truth like in philippians 4 8 where paul says and finally my brothers whatever is true and lovely noble pure and admirable excellent and worthy of praise think on these things and i'm reminded that by the power of christ by the power of his spirit i have the authority to take thoughts captive and make them obedient to the lord i see our minds as a garden and guys we have the authority of what we plant and what we allow to grow and what we allow to be uprooted and i want to grow things of the lord things of his word and by the power of his spirit in me i want to uproot the things that are of my flesh the things that are not of him and something else that this reminds me of is in first corinthians 3 where paul says that it's our job to water some of us plant but it is god who does the growing of the seeds um and what that basically means is that it's our job to pray for people to love people to walk alongside people and to share the message of christ with people but it is not our job to change people or to or to judge people or to save people but we entrust the souls of people to the lord as we love them and walk alongside them which is just a good reminder i've got my essential oil diffuser there we love them oh my stuffed animals guys i can't know if you um can tell but i love the cozy vibes i have i got this chair at a little antique store which we just love that and my all my little stationery stuff here for writing letters this so my one of my best friends who also lives here hannah may gave me this idea and i adopted it it is a paper towel holder and i put all my scrunchies on it how fun is that and this um is where like i do podcasts i do youtube videos it's a sweet place and we got the window for that natural light you know what i'm saying um and here is where i get ready for the day but notice that there's scripture here because is by storing his word in my heart and by letting his word dictate how i view myself and how i view others um that is like the best way that i could get ready for the day john 1 12 i'm reminded that i am a child of god galatians 2 20 i am reminded that it's no longer i who live but christ who lives in me first peter 2 9 i am walking in his marvelous light because he called me to it i am his chosen race royal priesthood holy nation his own possession i was made to proclaim his glory ephesians 2 109 is workmanship created in christ jesus to do good works which he prepared in advance for me to do so that i should walk in them second corinthians 5 17 if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has passed away and behold the new has come in genesis 1 27 i and every human being are created in the image of god male and female he created all of us in the image of god friend i recently released a podcast on how to practically memorize scripture and this is one of the ways that i do it i speak it i write it i read it i post it i like it's so powerful it's so powerful when you read it in the word you speak it out loud you write it down and you post it somewhere that you can see it every day and be reminded of it store it in your heart and let the lord transform you by the renewing of your mind so that you may be able to test and approve his good pleasing and perfect will for you we have an enemy who is the father of lies he is the deceiver and the world is run by the enemy and so whenever you go into each day you are going to be told from voices of deceit who you who you are not and so how powerful is it to know who you are and so not only can you see yourself the way that god sees you but you can also see others the way that god sees others and you can live it out with boldness with authority and with strength this is one of my favorite little signs it's my little flower market how fun and my sweet friend hannah may she walks through my room to get to hers which is just such a joy and this rug oh my goodness guys um i also released a podcast called from from stinky rug to stellar rug and this rug is the rug i'm referring to in the story so i will put my podcast link um below so that y'all can go and check that out but this rug is a sweet story and it definitely i think brings the room together y'all i love you i pray that this encourages you i know that i'm so thankful for this safe place this sweet place of retreat um and i pray that this just brightened your day y'all don't forget how awesome you are and i'll see you next time    you beautiful people hi i'm emma mae jenkins and i'm so so grateful that you have joined me on my youtube channel you notice we are in a different place i am back home um with my sweet family for winter break um because college we have a we have a big winter break so i come back home um and this is one of our guest rooms because our family moved and so we are just in a fun little different location changing it up a bit but y'all i'm so thankful for your life i'm so thankful that you're here and i'm so excited because today i'm gonna go through um my fall collection with you um just i want to kind of bullet point each um piece of merch and share with you like my heart behind it and also provide the link down below so that you can go and purchase the merch whether it be for you or loved ones or whatever or both um and also just i think it's so cool because not only i know that whenever i wear it i'm comforted in the truth i'm reminded of god's word i'm reminded of his heart but also it's a great like open door for conversation like i've been in the grocery store and had people compliment me on my shirt that says peace which we will talk about in a hot minute but it's just so cool because then you get to talk about peace and even if you don't talk about it with them and you just say thank you if it's a passing by like they were still encouraged to see the word peace they were still encouraged to see the word set apart and maybe it even got them thinking maybe um they had a conversation with someone else about it the day before and god was just continuing to water that seed you never know but just one being comforted by it it's comfort color so it's very very very just cozy um but also just wearing it when i'm out and about and being willing and available before the lord to have conversations to have gospel conversations with people so beautiful so i'm wanting to go through each piece of merch the first is the peace shirt very excited that comes in the color yellow and green um this picture will show for you to see what it looks like um and so there are three verses that i want to share with you in regard to this shirt colossians 3 15 says that may the peace of god rule in your heart as you remember as you are a member of his body and you are called to peace friend you are called to peace and i pray that it may rule in your heart also proverbs 3 5 and 6. this is really exciting this has been something that's been on my heart for a long time and i'm excited to to share it with you so proverbs 3 5 and 6 says to trust in the lord with all of your heart don't lean on your own understanding but in all of your ways submit to him know him acknowledge him and he will make your path straight and in philippians 4 verses 6 and 7 paul tells us do not be anxious about anything but in everything with prayer and petition and with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god and he will guard your heart and mind in your p in his peace that surpasses all understanding in christ jesus so whenever i put proverbs 3 5 and 6 and philippians 4 6 and 7 together i get really excited because god tells us to not lean on our own understanding and to trust him and he promises us to give us his peace that surpasses all understanding so what that tells me is that peace and trust go hand in hand i'm able to like experience the peace of god when i put my trust in him i can't be putting my trust in all of these different things hanging on to control in all of these different areas and yet expect to be walking in the peace of god i must trust in god with all of my heart not lean on my own understanding and bring my request before him like be be entrust in him and submit to him and he will guard my heart and mind with his peace that surpasses all understanding he's so good the next one is a continuation of the spring collection but it is a butter yellow um sweatshirt bold as a lion and some verses behind this message is first and foremost proverbs 28 1 where we are told that the righteous are as bold as a lion and ii timothy 1 7 we know that god has not given us a spirit of fear or timidity but rather a spirit of power love and a sound mind other versions say self-discipline and excuse me and in isaiah 41 10 god says do not fear for i am with you do not be dismayed for i am your god i will strengthen you and help you and uphold you with my righteous right hand he's so faithful so whenever i have the urge or the tendency to cower down in fear whenever i have the urge or the tendency to be timid and to hide i'm reminded of god's truth that he strengthens me he upholds me that spirit of fear and timidity is not the spirit that he has given me and by the power of he within me i can live out what he's called me to live out i can be confident and bold and i can i can have that that strength because all of it comes from the source of his presence and who he is and because he's in me i don't have to fear so so encouraging the next one is set apart and this comes in a blue and mauve t-shirt and the verses from the meaning behind this shirt is in first peter 2 9 we are encouraged and reminded that as a church as god's people we are chosen we are his royal priesthood we are his holy nation we're his chosen people and what's so encouraging about that is like he has set us apart and called us out of the darkness and into his marvelous light like we are not of the world the world does not invite us as its own because we are not of the world we do not belong to the world we are his we belong to god once we received the name of jesus believed in his name put trust in his name repented from our from our sin like friend you've been given the right to become a child of god it's who we are we are coheirs with christ and heirs in the kingdom of heaven how powerful i love how god told jeremiah in chapter 1 verse 5 he said before you were born i knew you and i set you apart and he had called jeremiah to be a prophet among the nations what's so cool is that like god has given you specific strengths and a unique purpose to bring him glory he set you apart for that in psalm 139 we know that god is fearfully and wonderfully knit you and i and the person next to you and the other person next to you he's knitted us together in his image and his works are wonderful and i know that full well so you can just be encouraged so cool is i think sometimes we can get caught up in comparison and insecurity and jealousy and just lose this confident trust in who god made us to be uniquely um and when we do that not only are we able to walk securely in whom he made us to be but we're not really able to celebrate the people next to us who are who are uniquely made as well and so there's just a really sweet confidence that happens whenever we trust that god has set us apart made us in his image uniquely made us a new creation in christ and then when we see ourselves the way god sees us we can see others the way god sees others and we can celebrate that um in other people as well which is just so powerful um authentic yes so the authentic comes in the lighter blue sweatshirt and it comes in the blue t-shirt and authentic this message comes from matthew 23 25 through 26 and i want to read this to you guys so um in matthew chapter 23 verses 25 and 26 jesus is addressing the religious leaders um he says what sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you pharisees hypocrites for you are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish but inside you are filthy full of greed and self-indulgence you blind pharisee first wash the inside of the cup and the dish and then the outside will become clean too and what i just think is so encouraging whenever i read this is like it doesn't matter how many good things we do how many good things we say help put together our outward appearances god cares about the heart like first daniel 16 7 says that god like god does not look at the things people look at for people look at the outward appearance but god looks at the heart he cares about what's going on in here and then that will overflow into everything out here like guard your heart above all else proverbs 4 23 for everything that you do flows from it so these religious pharisees they were saying all the right things they were preaching all the right things but their heart was about them they wanted to get the attention it was self-righteous they were greedy they were prideful their heart was not in the right motive their heart was not in the right posture and jesus was addressing that he said first clean the inside then the outside will come clean too from a pure motive like the outside will be proof of that but that i just love this because jesus is saying to us like i want an authentic relationship with you these pharisees are pretending that they care about me they're or they're they may even fully be convinced that they are they may become fully convinced that they love me and that they're with me and that they care about my word but their heart says a totally different story and i just love that jesus wants authenticity he wants an authentic relationship and i want to share a couple more verses with you on that on that very thing in hosea um this is so so powerful the lord says my people are being destroyed because they don't know me which i just thought was so to the point yet so saddening um and all at the same time encouraging it's it's like to the point because yep destruction comes from not knowing god and it's saddening because i want everyone to know god and it's encouraging though because it shows that okay like god didn't come and rescue me because of my own works or because of how i made my outside be manufactured to look but god came and rescued me because because that's what he did because he was demonstrating his perfect love for me and that while i was still a sinner he sent his one and only son to come and die for me and rise again and he wants a real relationship with me so it encourages me and that like wow so like destruction isn't gonna come from not having your life all put together or having all of the right answers or having the right colored hair or having the right colored socks or living in the right location like destruction comes from not knowing god he wants to know you authentic authentically in a real way last verse on this topic um or two verses in hosea 6 um verse 3 it says oh that we might know the lord let us press on to know him because my life is going to reflect whether or not i know god let us press on to know him may that be my aim and then everything else is going to reflect that in verse 6 of chapter 6 god says i want you this is so good i want you to show love not offer sacrifices i want you to know me more than i want burnt offerings so god's like i don't want this show and it not come from a place of loving me i don't want all of these gifts whenever it doesn't come from a place of genuinely knowing me god wants it authentic relationship with you and what's so cool is i know that whenever i am i'm walking like in an authentic relationship with god i have discovered the true authentic version of who he made me to be all the more which is just so cool um and then troubled i'm actually wearing the sweatshirt version of it a troubled world does not have to mean a troubled heart and i actually made a full video on this message before this merch was made which is really really fun but this comes in this sweatshirt also in a mauve t-shirt and a green t-shirt um and the verses behind it are in john 14 27 when jesus tells his disciples like my peace i give you my peace i leave with you and i do not give to you as the world gives so don't let your hearts be troubled hold on to that in john 16 33 jesus says in this world you will have trouble but take heart for i have overcome the world what's so powerful about that is that jesus says don't let your heart be troubled but in this world you're going to have trouble and what that tells me is that my circumstances do not have to determine the posture of my heart but it is the fact that he is overcome it is the fact that he gives me peace it is the fact that he is with me that i don't have to have a troubled heart and i get to share this hope with the world hebrews 6 19 this hope that we have through christ is an anchor firm and secure in our soul and i get to share it with the world it's an opportunity to talk about him when i'm in the same circumstance as the person next to me yet i'm able to have peace and rest and security and the other person is occupied with anxiety and fear and turmoil and they ask you're in the same circumstance as me why are you responding in that way and then i get to talk about jesus about how greater is he living in me than the enemy living in the world that he has overcome so i don't have to be troubled that he has given me this peace that the world cannot give therefore the world cannot take away and it's here available for you too he wants to give it to you too he came and died and rose again for you too just so powerful his love his peace his hope it doesn't end with me but it continues with me and it would be selfish of me to keep it to myself that's why one of the means by which i'm sharing it because he's opened the door to do so is through merch so incredible humans i pray that um you're um blessed in just hearing the heart behind all of this merch and going to the link below i pray that you have fun shopping y'all are so wonderful i'll talk to y'all later you hi incredible and loved and such significant people my name is mma jenkins and i'm so thankful that you chose to click play and come on over to my channel i pray that you're having the best day and i don't think you could ever emphasize enough to someone that they matter and so i just want to emphasize to you today that you matter to god that you are made in his image for his glory fearfully and wonderfully made i am so thankful for your life you're not an accident you are on purpose you are pursued by god wanted by him he made you to be in relationship with himself now just sit and think in that for a moment the god who is in need of nothing like he is all sufficient he is holy he is the king of kings he is the creator of the world of the universe the creator of you and i and he wants a personal forever relationship with you i could literally hit stop right now on this record button and that would be that would be enough information to sit on and think on throughout your day and i pray that that is not just words that puff you up and make you feel good for a hot second and then you forget how special you are within a matter of a minute i pray that that sinks deep into your own heart and that you listen to that carefully because that is not words that i made up just to make you feel good about yourself those are words that come straight from the word of god second timothy 3 16 says that the word of god is alive and active sharper than any double-edged sword dividing soul and spirit joints and marrow oh i think i actually just put together um hebrews 4 12 and 2 timothy 3 16. so i'll just share both of them with you second timothy 3 16 says the word that the word of god is god breathed that it has been made profitable for teaching correcting rebuking and training in righteousness so that the righteous person may be equipped for every good work and hebrews 4 12 says that the word of god is alive and it is active sharper than any two-edged sword dividing soul and spirit joints and marrow judging the thoughts and the attitudes of the heart everything that i am is laid before the lord nothing is hidden from his sight and if we read that in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and we know that god is the same yesterday today and forever that means that what he says about you he says about how he made you what he says about what you mean to him is factual it is not hanging on what the opinions of other people are of you it is not hanging on what you feel about yourself it is not hanging on the experiences that have led you up to this moment it is hanging on his word and what he says is true is it it is unchanging it is reliable it will not return void and i pray that you can rest in that reality today today's video is going to be short but i believe very impactful for certain because it has been something that the lord has been challenging me in for the last few weeks and so i pray that it challenges you as well in a good direction i pray that it convicts you when you where you need to be convicted it encourages you and how you need to be encouraged today we're talking about what is your go-to let me explain so whether good or tough moments like where is your first resort what is your go-to response i know that for me like especially whenever a tough or failing or frustrating moment occurs like sometimes my first resort is to overthink and to think and to think some more and i will worry about the issue or stress or try to calm the tension on my own strength i will go into peacekeeping mode and try and make sure that the boat is not rocked try and resolve any conflict try and um just think my way through things and then i'll look up sometimes hours later and i realized i never prayed about it all i did was think about it and think about it and think about it and try and bring resolution to it on my own strength and i don't know about you but my heart and my flesh may fail but the strength of my lord that is like nothing else and i need it yet how often do i not seek him how often do i not rely on that strength that because of christ i have complete access to and i wrote down some other other resorts that some of us may go to in moments that are whether it be heated conversations or hearing difficult news or um just being in a stress stressful circumstance um and then also good news as well i think sometimes whenever we hear good news um how often do we go and do our own thing and we forget to seek the lord in that moment and thank him in that moment um but i specifically want to hone into the frustrating the difficult the unexpected tough moments and what is our first resort in those moments do you burst out in anger is that your your go-to whether it be coming from a place of pride um or coming from a place of fear do you let it unleash in a posture of anger um i don't know if you just heard that but cars just honk their horns outside um do you shut down does it like do you just go into quiet mode withdrawal do you dwell in worry and like me sometimes overthink and overthink and overthink and then yep overthink some more or do you immediately go and vent to someone like is your first resort that you need to call and call somebody and just vomit outwards or even if it's your outlet your resort is social media go and write a caption about it go into someone's comments and talk about it like where is your first resort and i want to challenge not only y'all but also myself as i've been like i said challenged with this the last couple weeks is what if we chose to have a different go-to or a different first resort because i i want to acknowledge up front that um to feel a little defensive if our pride is attacked or to to get afraid whatever the circumstance may be or to unleash anger in that moment to overthink to worry to feel overwhelmed to withdraw to shut down to have this urge to go and tell somebody to go and vent to someone in some outlet um all of those things are understandable so i want to let you know that you are not crazy for when you're in an unexpected frustrating moment when you are in a difficult scenario whenever you hear really tough news and any of those things are your resort or your go-to response um you're not crazy all of us as humans have our go-to's um they may not lead to the best outcome we may regret them after we go to them but just know that you're not alone that that is understandable but i want to challenge us because i believe that the lord is challenging us calling us higher calling us to something better calling us to something that will not leave us regretful as a first resort as our go-to and that is what if we chose to pray first what if we chose to seek god first in those moments of feeling frustrated in those moments of having unexpected feelings of being overwhelmed in those moments of hearing news that that just really rocked our boat what if our first resort was prayer our first resort was to seek god in his strength to seek his face now i tell you what i bet i can say from my own experience that that is a game changer it pivots my outcome sometimes not necessarily the circumstances outcome but it definitely changes my heart postures outcome it changes my mentality in the outcome it changes maybe um how regretful i am after the fact it changes the like how um the quality of communication in my relationships sometimes whenever i choose to seek god first rather than resorting to worry resorting to anger resorting to shutting down what if we chose to seek god first it may even while yes going in doing life with people is necessary going and talking to people having safe places in your relationships to process tough stuff that is so good but i bet that if you were to pause and seek god first and pray about it first then you may be able to look back on those conversations that you did need to have and maybe you didn't say things that you regret as you would have had you just gone invented before even having a second thought maybe you would have honored people better in the words you chose just something to think about like today's message is actually really simple but i think i hope because it's something i'm learning i hope it's very relatable something very practical of before you before you respond before before you go and type a post before you go and vent but like before your next move what if you were to pause and seek the lord first and pray ask him for wisdom ask him for guidance speak scripture over your heart in his word our mind is renewed the power of his word is transformative what if our first go-to our first resort was going to see what god has to say was having a simple prayer of god i need you right now because i don't know about you but that in itself changes my mentality it does change the posture of my heart whenever i first pursued the lord before operating out of my flesh before operating out of my feelings before operating out of my ult like my first impulse or instinct and the more that we do that the more that that habit cultivates and it becomes easier and easier to seek him first because that becomes our normal go-to our normal first resort so sweet just something to think about and i was really encouraged by this reality whenever i was reading in nehemiah last week in nehemiah chapter one starting in verse starting in verse one we'll just start there um during the month of chislev in the 20th year when i was so nehemiah is writing this when i was in the fortress city of susa han and i one of my brothers arrived with men from judah and i questioned them about jerusalem and the jewish remnant that had survived the exile they said to me the remnant in the province who has survived the exile are in great trouble so the jews are in great trouble and disgrace jerusalem's wall has been broken down and its gates have been burned so nehemiah is a cup bearer for the king and he is in the city of susa and his brother him and i comes to him and nehemiah's asking how are the people how are god's people and hannah and i gives him like for as we were just referring to frustrating difficult trying news the people are actually not doing well they're filled with trouble and with disgrace the walls of jerusalem have been have been taken down it's not looking good basically but look at nehemiah's response starting in verse 4 when i heard these words i sat down and wept i mourned for a number of days what fasting and praying before the god of heavens when i read that i was just so encouraged he's just heard some of the most devastating news about his people about god's people and what was his resort to mourn over those people and to seek the lord in prayer and fasting wow so i pray throughout your week it's a guarantee that whether it seems smaller it seems magnified there will be moments where it'll be easy to to not think before you speak it'll be easy to operate out of emotions it'll be easy to to shut down and not approach the task at hand because it's overwhelming or to be in fear of conflict and i whatever wherever you are on that scale again you're not crazy that's human but god wants to take us deeper he wants to call us higher as well the lord wants us to experience the beauty and the joy of walking in awareness of his presence and seeking him first and so i want us to go deeper i want us to grow in the lord together and so what would it look like not if those moments come this week but when they come what if you were just to pause pause and pray pause and seek the lord i know that there are different moments whether you're in a conversation and you say hey this is a little heated um i i need to go pray about this can i can i call you back like whatever the situation may be and it won't be something that you regret and so i i just pray that that encourages you like what if we chose to pray first what if we chose to seek the lord first how would our relationships be benefited how would our mental health be benefited just in the sense of stress and chaos and making something out of nothing sometimes and being filled with regret sometimes because of how we choose to respond to things how would we see things benefit by simply choosing to seek the lord first in prayer going to him asking for wisdom asking for guidance reminding your soul of his word reminding your soul of his promises i love in romans 8 how paul says that when our mind is governed by the spirit we are led in life and in peace but a mind governed by the flesh leads to sin and death and it's a moment by moment choice to let our minds be governed by the spirit a moment by moment choice to let his word be a lamp to our feet and a light to our path a moment by moment choice to devote ourselves to prayer to pause and to seek him so awesome and we're like we're growing again it's a moment by moment choice and i don't do it every time and i'm learning from the lord in his word learning from other people who do that well and just it's it's such a a sweet journey with the lord but i have come to find that seeking god first is never a decision that i regretted so i pray that today's message encourages you and it's just a practical nugget for you to carry into your week and i pray that it benefits you and i pray it benefits your relationships you are so loved so loved be sure and subscribe if you're not yet subscribed comment down below on what you would like to be encouraged by what videos what content you would like to see moving forward um also you can find more of my content and just day-to-day things on my instagram at first corinthians 13 underscore love as well as my podcast where an episode comes out every wednesday we have you heard podcasts available and apple and spotify y'all i love you i'm proud of you i'm thankful for you you'll have a blessed week what's up what's up incredible people my name is emma may jenkins and i'm so stoked so honored to have you on the have you heard podcast you are so deeply loved and if you have been journeying with me and the incredible people i've gotten to have on the podcast throughout the month of february we have had some awesome conversations about the lord who is love about his word who tells us what love looks like what it looks like to live it out how we were made for it and we've had conversations with people what it looks like to practically live that out every day and advice that people have gained from walking with the lord and from experiences that they've had and i honestly could not think of a better grand finale of this month of celebrating the love of the lord in relationships and in your own walk then having my fiancee on this is so fun and not only that but this is the first time we've ever like gotten to video record an audio recording of the podcast so this is like extra special yeah it is it's the first time for me to be on here and then also first time to record it and you can see this on youtube where you can watch it or you can listen to it on your podcast or you can watch it on youtube it's really two options here right yeah so i'm really really pumped y'all because today we're talking about honestly both of our journeys leading up to us being together in a relationship and we're going to be talking about the faithfulness of the lord and what we learned leading up to the point of us being together and how truly the like to be in a relationship a romantic relationship with someone it's not a promise in scripture that that is going to happen in your life um we see it happen in a lot of people's lives but and god has ordained every day of your life in his book before a single one of them came to be so the way that your life unfolds as you seek the lord first like it's on purpose and it's filled with beauty whether or not it consists of getting married or not um and so we want to if you're not in a relationship we want you to stay keep watching keep listening because ultimately the heartbeat of this conversation is the importance of seeking god first and whether or not you end up in a marriage relationship whenever you seek the lord first it impacts your entire life for the better yeah yeah sure i mean it has been a long time coming it really has there's been a lot of a lot of journeys a lot of milestones that we've come to before our relationship before i even knew you and in the relationship and it's really cool that now we get to come here and we're not coming into this thinking that we know everything that we have it all figured out because we are absolutely far from that but it is very sweet to come and share just with honestly not what we did but what god did through us because i know my journey and your journey are honestly very different but very beautiful because i come from a past of having relationships not being wise in those relationships and also having a past of addiction to pornography addiction to uh to that sex lust and how how i came over that and so we we both come from very different backgrounds but it's it's very beautiful how god can take both of those um both of those areas of our lives so for that sin where satan tried to bog us down and it can bring us together and become one flesh and have that beauty that beautiful uh marriage between the two yeah i i think that's just a really powerful encouragement too to know that like you're story your life testimony is not powerful because of how many times you've messed up or how good none of us are good on our own but yeah quote unquote um good your life has been like what makes your testimony powerful is the redemption of the lord it's the presence of the spirit and so josh may come from a story of like not doing relationships the best and having certain addictions that he navigated through and i may come from a background of like my only relationship experience was with one guy who was like awesome but we did it for a month long and then i realized god doesn't want me here i'm gonna keep on going in a single season like that was literally my only relationship experience um but like to know that the lord whenever you submit to him and surrender your life to him it's he who makes your testimony powerful and now it's fun getting to sit down and talk with y'all because it's like we may be coming from two different places but we're both talking about the same god that led us to where we are that's exactly right and i mean i think just to begin this whole conversation off with how do you prepare your heart well you have to just as we're supposed to build our house on a rock we're not supposed to build our house in the sand i want to build my own house my house that's not with emma at this point that i want to build my life on that rock and i came to that conclusion i came to that realization that you know what my house is on the sand because i keep on falling over i look for porn i look for relationships i look for all these different things but i wake up the next day and i'm at the same place or i've fallen over or it's just it leaves me wanting more more thirsty i i look for the like it's like me going into the desert and looking for water it's like i'm going and i'm searching and i'm searching and it's like i'm promised that there's water here somewhere but i can't find any of it and i'm continually searching and i had to come to that realization of that at some point i i i want to be married at some point i want to and on the chance of me actually getting married i don't want to come and have to sit across the table from my kids and tell them that your mom and i are getting a divorce because i could not put my wants aside for your needs i kept on looking at pornography and dishonoring my wife i kept on looking at pornography and dishonoring my daughters and my son and not being the leader in the godly counsel that they need because i don't i don't want to be that man i want to be a man that that stands up for others i want to be that selfless man i don't want to be a selfish man and so i could go and look from the desert or i can continue to lean back on the water that god is that that that water that he promised that woman at the well they promised her a living water that you will thirst no more and i tell you time and time again after i watched a video or after i did something i was always thirsty i was always wanting more and more and more and never satisfied until i finally found that water and thought you know what i'm done living for myself i'm done i'm done doing that i'm gonna i'm gonna start living for my future wife for my future kids and again that's before i knew emma that was before yeah that was before we even started we even started talking before i knew that emma was on this earth like i wanted to do that for my wife and for my kids before i even knew that if i was going to have a wife and kids i wanted to go ahead and honor them the way that i should be honoring them man that's like that's so powerful to for your heart posture to be god i just want to honor you yeah and i want to as you say in first peter like to be holy because you are holy like i want god to be my because like why am i choosing to say no to the things of this world why am i choosing to love people well why am i choosing to daily get up and spend time in the word why am i choosing to live the life that i'm living because he's holy because he's worth it because he's good and he's worthy of all of like in my complete devotion he's worthy of it and then the best way i could love a future spouse or love my future kids or be a godly boyfriend who honors my girlfriend well or cherishes my fiance the way god has called me to like that's going to happen if the root of it all was that i was being honoring and cherishing and loving because god had called me to be like when god is our because like it's gonna bless our relationships but if i'm doing if i'm choosing to like put up a good front of being a quote unquote godly person yeah just because i just to get a person yeah then that person that i'm wanting is an imperfect person yeah and there will be struggles that come whenever i'm in that relationship with him and so then like my because is going to be faulty because i'm putting it on a faulty person and that i just i know whenever you told me that that you chose to seek the lord first with also the mindset of i want to start loving my wife now if that's what god has planned for me i felt so loved yeah by you yeah doing that i mean i mean that makes sense because if you look back at ephesians five yeah that like if you've ever been in a church service and they talked about marriage it's usually talked about ephesians five or if you maybe if you haven't or if you've been to a wedding or if you've been to something ephesians 5 is quoted and it talks about a wife um submitting to her husband and i think that that submitting work can be almost terrifying a little bit but like we're gonna have to go into that but that's just it's it's i get to love you selflessly and but it comes back right on the man and it says well men you have to give up yourself as christ gave up himself for the church and so how how i'm supposed i'm supposed to give up myself so i'm supposed to give up my needs and my wants for my kids for my wife i want to do that before i even know their name before that kid is even conceived before that kid steps on this earth man i love my kids already i can tell you that so much and i loved you already before i even met you because i know that there that i can love as christ loved the church and gave himself up and again that's that's in a relationship context i can love as christ loved the church even not in a romantic relationship i can love as christ loved the church by giving himself up to my family to my friends to that neighbor across the street that has a snow driveway that i can go and love and give myself up because i'd much rather be in the warmth when i can actually go out and shovel their driveway because i can give myself up as christ loved the church and that i i want to live that's that that's my motto right there i want to give myself up as christ as christ gave himself up for the church that's so good and it makes me think about how like i can't expect to love my future spouse well if i'm not putting in the investment to love my family well yeah or to be a good sister or to be a good friend or to be like like i can't jump into a relationship and assume i'm gonna love this person so well if i haven't been practicing love in my day-to-day beforehand somebody feel the romantic love yeah but like even date like the lord says he in his word marriage is hard yeah that it is tough like he warns you like okay if you c he like through paul he says if you can't stand the like sexual temptations and you must get married get married but it's going to be a tough walk it's a walk that's beautiful because god designed it and it reflects him and it's sanctifying and it's like it's it's a picture of god's love with the church like it's beautiful but if i'm expecting myself to jump into a marriage and love this person well if i haven't been living a life loving people well then it's not going to transfer the way i'm thinking it will because romantic love it's it's not always as consistent as unconditional love is yeah you know that's that's that's that is that's beautiful and that is that is so good because i think you even look in the garden like go back to way back when the first romantic relationship out there that the lord looks at it and says that's a very good and adam and eve and then they sin and you see the fall and you see adam's sin and you see eve's sin and he's and like the passivity that they both have like i can i can come and i can live a passive life as they did but i'm not called to passivity i'm not called to live that way i'm called to to love deep i'm called to love hard i'm called to love as a fire like that's what i want to do but like that's easy to say that's easy to say well marriage is hard and you should love them well and you should do this and it's like how how on earth would someone practically do that and i think one thing that really i cling to in that time of figuring out of how can i love my wife how can i love my kids how can i do that now how do i not live a passive life before that's even harder like you you can't put a face to it but um i think one thing i really cling to was in um psalms 119 9 through 11 and it talks about of how does a young man keep his way pure by guarding it according to your word lord let me not stumble from your commandments but let me seek your face first like that's what i want to do how does the young man keep his way pure by guarding it according to your word so now i know what that basis line is from everything here on out your work my boundaries how i love like my friends how i how i treat them with timing all the stuff like how i do this is how i do the book like how i how i do the this like you know yeah it's gonna be a reflection exactly it's required you can't you can't live without it truly it's like what um solomon said like to guard your heart above all else for everything that you do flows from it yeah i remember before we started dating like i knew that you liked me and like if i told you that i liked you back then like you were gonna go ask my dad and so i was i i knew that i like had feelings for you i was in like this pocket of time where i was just seeking the lord and asking like all of my mentors for advice and like okay i really want to step into this but i want to make sure that this is a step that i need to do just like god i commit my plans to you and i ask that you would establish my steps and show me what what is of you and what is not and in that little pocket of time as you were just so patiently waiting i one of my mentors she gave me this word of advice and she said emma like whenever you're stepping into this relationship you're or actually whenever you're stepping into any relationship you're always going to be sacrificing something anytime yeah so but stepping into this relationship with josh will you be sacrificing anything godly and i wanted to share that because i think it would just be helpful for anybody to adopt um but it really put into perspective my because like god has set the standard for my life my body is his temple i've committed my plans and my ways to him like he he is the solid rock that i'm standing on and so like if that's the case then i don't want to sacrifice anything of him yeah i want if anything this relationship to be something that points to him that honors him that leads me closer to him and so with that being my filter and i just will never forget that and um i remember telling her like i truly don't believe that i will be sacrificing anything godly i think i'm going to be sacrificing a lot of fear yeah and at the time i didn't know what that meant but i just um i just think it's really really special how whenever the lord like is leading you and establishing your steps and he leads you into a relationship it's for the purpose of bringing glory to him and it's for the purpose of making you look more like his son and it's for the purpose of reflecting the fact that like we were made to do life in community and that community comes in different forms um but i think like if you're debating on whether or not you should step into a relationship that was a very helpful question that i received is you're going to be sacrificing something stepping into a relationship are you sacrificing anything godly and if this time preparing for you to decide whether or not you're stepping into this relationship hasn't been a preparation season of just being with god and seeking to be more like him and seeking to be obedient to him then it makes sense that your if it's godly then it can't be the if it's godly something that's being sacrificed it can't be the relationship for me that may not sound like it's appealing to you because whatever is godly may not matter and so if that's the case for you then i encourage you to take a step back and take inventory because if relationships were designed by the lord and the lord is not your filter by which you decide if this relationship is good then you're not ready for that relationship like be holy because he is holy commit your ways to him and let him establish it you're going to sacrifice something in this relationship and if you're sacrificing something godly then it isn't the right time for you or it isn't the right relationship for what you say yes to means that you're saying no to something else exactly and so are you are you saying no to something godly that's so good i have a question for you emma and this is i think this is something it's like sweet the interview's switching up i know this is my podcast normally well here's the question because we just talked about how i came from a very a non-godly past for not honoring people for looking at pornography and having a porn addiction um a very real thing that honestly a lot of people that are listening right now are probably struggle with how how did coming into this relationship how did how did that make you feel how what was the struggles of that of hearing that i had that past what how did that go about for you well so i want to fill everybody in so i think josh like did such a great job at honoring me you can go back and look at some of our previous youtube videos we did together about our first date and how he pursued me in the start and it's just so like i felt so cherished and honestly it pointed me towards the lord and how the lord pursued me it was such a reflection of that um but it wasn't until like two months into our relationship that josh um said hey let's sit down for coffee because i i need to share my story with you and that was when he shared with me like the the good the bad the ugly the things you you're eager to share and the things it takes a lot of courage to even whisper it out there he shared it with me because he was like if you're the woman that god has for me then i trust you will forgive me and we're gonna walk through this together but if if you can't forgive me of this and you won't bestow grace on my life in this then then you aren't the woman for me and i want you to know up front so that we can so that you can know and you can be honored by being able to make that decision um so first off i felt very grateful for his honesty your honesty it honestly is like a warm hug we read in proverbs and it was honoring um and i would be lying though if i said it wasn't hard to hear um but like i said earlier no matter what your story is like paul tells us in romans 3 23 that we have all sinned and fallen short of god's glory different sins come with different consequences but sin is sin and like in that alone were both sinners two imperfect humans coming to date each other and so for me to look at josh in a way that's looking down on him because of a certain sin that had become an obstacle in his life then that would be like that would be prideful of me because i'm no better than he is even though the sins in my life look different than his they still separated me from god too um and so i think but i can't like i can't have that perspective hearing that news if i haven't like spent time alone with god if i haven't been walking with him and my relationship with him hasn't been growing because the only way you can respond with such forgiveness and grace is by the power of the spirit like that doesn't happen through the flesh um and so that's another reason why it's so important is like when you're stepping into a relationship it's two imperfect people coming together and by being empowered by the spirit you're going to be able to walk alongside each other and forgive each other um which is so necessary um but i will say that it was very hard to hear just because pornography and lust and sexual um sins and temptations like it's just not cool and so for me to also be like okay great let's move on like i'm not gonna treat it that way either because sin is sin and it should be despised at not josh but the sin because sin not only like separates us from the lord but it drives a wedge between people and so it's important to deal with it for the reality that it is and say like no like that's not of god and i am so honored to sit across the table from a man who's aware of that and i also felt very honored by you that like you didn't step into the relationship still like full-fledged operating from that place yeah like that was something like neither one of us are in a perfect place but that was something that like you were in you like before we had started dating had intentionally like had godly counsel you had sought the lord in prayer and in his word and were intentional to like make god the foundation of your life and i think that also helped me in my response was that like i knew his attitude towards it his attitude towards it was hey i love you will you forgive me because this is not of god and i know it's not honoring to you but i i want to honor the lord yeah i want to be obedient to him i want him to be glorified through my life but one of the ways i can do that is by letting you know that this is a part of my story um and so i feel like i just said a whole lot that's so good i think it was it was a mixture of emotions because as a girl you can sometimes feel like i want to be enough for him i want to be beautiful to him what if i don't meet expectations that he's had if he's seen these other images and i think that's also why having a solid relationship with the lord is also so important it's like where is my confidence found where where who calls me beautiful first like the expectations that i have on myself are what god has already said of me and living that out and and i'm like our relationship has to be interdependent like my identity my value my worth it's found in the lord and josh in my not as we walk together he reminds me of what the lord has already spoken over me um but those those thoughts crossed my mind they're real emotions and i think it's important of course we've had deeper conversations as we are now engaged and have gone through premarital counseling and but like we're both running the race that's been set before us and because we're doing that we've been led and equipped to like have certain conversations that are really hard but the conversations that are hard are worth it because i'm going to tell you secrecy it will totally divide a relationship honesty is so powerful and um it builds trust honesty definitely helps cultivate a safe place and so in the midst of all those emotions that were happening by the power of the spirit there was forgiveness and by the peace of god i knew that this relationship was where i was supposed to be truly that that is so good and even just to put a big old bow on this and to stamp it it's it what that is right there is what i'm living in is what i will be living out and so what i'm living in am i living in the world like no i'm supposed to i'm not supposed to be in the wrong supposed to be like i'm supposed to be like that's how i'm supposed to be like christ like i want to live in the word of god i want to i want to see like how do i respond well god literally as as a as a woman was thrown at his feet and they said cast stones on him like jesus said no like draw the line in the sand like for those of you who have not sinned you throw the first stone and soon they all triggered away like he responds in grace yeah and so how can i respond to anybody not just porn not just anything like if how can i respond to a friend that has hurt me i want to respond in grace yeah i want to come and if someone is coming up to me asking for forgiveness i want to i want to bestow forgiveness on them and more like i want to give them an exceedingly abundantly greater like that's what i want to do because if i'm living in the world then i would respond how the world would will respond yeah and that would be of anger and of selfish intent and i i don't want to i don't want to live that way i don't want to do those things you know yeah and so it really does come to i want to be full of grace and i want to be full of mercy as my lord is full of grace and full of mercy and that doesn't just go from me to others that goes from me to me like i want to be gracious for myself because i could sit here and beat myself up and trust me i have i've gone down that road and i've done that plenty of times i'm an expert at it actually but i i could sit here and just beat myself up for my past or for what i did but i know that that will not do any good like the lord does not see like in in uh psalm 51 it literally says that he wipes our sins from his memories like we need to confess our sins to him we need to ask for forgiveness but then he wipes our sins away saying like you know what i see i see the blood of my son on you that's what i see i don't see anything else so how do i prepare my heart well first i want to get into the word i want i want to i want to how does a young man keep his prayer by seeking his word with your whole heart like i want to do that okay and then i want to live what i'm reading i want to live with that out i want to how do i prepare my heart in that way well i want to respond in grace i want to be on i want to have my house on a firm foundation because if i'm solid here and you're solid with god then we're solid here yeah and that's what it will be there will be arguments there will be hard times there will be times that man i love you but i really don't like you like there will be those times and that can almost be scary that can almost be confusing and be like no we just need like no i i love you and i'm in this for the long haul i forgive you i like just as christ has forgiven everything that we've done and everything that we're going to do i've already done that for you because you are going to be my wife like how awesome now i think one thing i really want to go back on kind of went on a little rant there for a fun second um is is coming into a relationship if you're if you're struggling with pornography like you may be in a relationship right now struggling with pornography you may be in a relationship right now and confused like well do i need to go in things no but search your heart see i need to make i need to make myself right with god i need to really do this and i want to surround myself with people who will walk alongside me i want to i want to surround myself with people that that love me and cherish me and and exactly hold me accountable for these things and there are there are countless uh things that will be able to help you do that so i want to first do that but if you're not in a relationship and you and you want to be or actually let me take that back if you're on a relationship and you just want to glorify god that's what this is all about this isn't like this is some about emma and i but this is all about god and us like i want to glorify god in this way so i want to i want to make sure that this is right because i'm at some point will come to the father and have to give an account for all my sins like i will have to stand there no matter who you are no matter where you from no matter what language you speak no matter what race you are no matter what gender you are we will all come to the father and have to give an account for our sins and will he look at me and say well done good and faithful servant or will he say to me depart because you never knew me i want to know him i want to do that with him yeah yeah and it makes me think about um like i heard this quote one time and i will butcher it because i can't remember who said it and i can't remember exactly what they said but it was something along the lines of if you love something that means that you have to hate something else so like you can't serve two masters so like in our in us because we've like specifically talked about pornography which i think is such an important thing to talk about i think something beautiful to address and i pray that it's helping encourage and challenge anyone listening in a good direction um but just thinking about how jesus talks about how we can't have two masters and if we love something that means that we hate something else thinking about sin and thinking about the ways that the enemy would love to tempt us and distract us away from seeking the heart of the lord and away from learning more about god and being obedient to him like i want to encourage you to like ask the lord to deepen your love for him and to deepen your love for his word because there comes a point where it's like yes this is tempting yes this looks pleasing to the eye yes this looks good yes this looks like it would meet a very deep want in me but i love god more like what if we got to that place where like i love god so much that even though yeah these look like they would and i know that they would give temporary satisfaction because they don't honor god i hate them like my love for god i want it to compel me to hate the things that aren't of him and and like we've said this in one of our videos before but to be to be tempted is not a sin but it's what how it's how we respond to that temptation for all of us are tempted and but no one's going to be tempted beyond what's common to mankind so welcome to the club and temptation you're not alone like the enemy would love for you to be convinced of the fact of of the idea that you're isolated and no one will understand and that's a big fat lie like no one will be tempted beyond what is common to mankind but when not if when you're tempted god is faithful to provide a way of escape so that you can endure it that's right every single time and so not if you get tempted again but when and how you get tempted again are you guarding your heart with his word do you love god do you love god enough to lean into his faithfulness and take his escape route do you love god enough that the temptation is something you hate like i think that that i don't think there's like a specific point to say i think i'm just going to leave that question out there to think on i'm not in a shameful way though because all of us again have sinned and fallen short of god's glory and we haven't taken that escape route and like josh mentioned that god is faithful and just to forgive those who confess their sins to him like he's such a good god but i want us to take our faith seriously i want us to take our walk with god seriously because whenever we take our walk with him seriously and we truly love him and we realize that those who love him obey him and his commands are not a burden and when we actually own that it's gonna bless this yeah it's gonna bless our friendships it's gonna bless our dating relationship it's gonna bless our relationship like josh said with ourselves um so it's just something to chew on yeah and think about that that's so good because you know what that that want to sleep with your girlfriend that want to have like watch pornography don't want to do whatever sin you can imagine yeah that's that's a real one and that's a real that's a real thing but it's how am what am i loving am i choosing this earth am i choosing or am i choosing god yeah and that's a beautiful thing i think about what i loved and admired about you is that you did walk in grace with me that you did come alongside me even though i wasn't struggling with it anymore but let me take it back even though i wasn't actively living in it now the struggle is always going to be there that struggle for whenever you get married whenever you have kids that that will always be there but that i wasn't living in it and you walked with grace in me and you're there with me and i have my guys to walk alongside me but i also have my fiance this the seriousness of this relationship i had my fiancee to also walk alongside me and my fiance to to love and to cherish and to to know when to you know babe i'm struggling right now yeah like i'm actually really struggling with this can you pray for me can you do this can you actually just come over like let's just watch a movie like like let's just do something uh to take my mind off of whatever it is um and so there are ways to to battle this together together as a as a as a dating couple as a married couple as a as a wherever what season you are in there are people around you i promise you that that if there's a church or if there's there's friends that want to love you that want to cherish you that wants you to walk alongside you and and show you the grace god and just surrounding yourself with people to love you and to cherish you and to walk alongside you you'll never regret that it's hard to begin that first step though it's it's like taking a step off of a diving board like i'm i'm hoping that this is not going to hurt like because sharing your sins though it's that it seems like it's painful and it may be a uncomfortability there's some legitimate psychological healing that comes from sharing your like from sharing your sins that's why it says confess your sins and you will be healed like there's a reason that god created us the way we are and that whenever we do confess our sins whenever we do love that way whenever we are able to live in freedom of that that god lets us have that healing and that grace and living that grace even inside ourselves yeah i love him i love him he's so he's so good and i i loved throughout like this whole love series throughout this month like we've talked about relationships we've talked about singleness we've talked about dating we're talking a little we honed in a little bit on it being engaged talked about the struggles um that come in that and the cheerfulness that comes with that um but the heartbeat of it all has been the presence of god and who he is and how worthy he is of our full affection and our praise and honestly just our whole life and so i really just wanted to like wrap up this incredible conversation with just an encouragement to you with the power of jesus like friend you you are a sinner who has fallen short of god's glory gone your own way just like me just like josh just like every human that has been and will be like welcome to the club but god who is so rich in mercy and mighty to save wants a relationship with you and speaking of relationships and love like he wants a relationship with us so bad that he would send his one and only son jesus who was tempted in every way but he didn't sin so that he would not only be able to empathize with us in our weaknesses but so that he overcame it so we can walk in his overcoming greater is he because i believed in him living in me than the enemy living in the world and not only that i can boldly approach god's throne of grace and ask him for help in my time of need helping my relationships help and in the quiet moments and help in the busy moments like what a great god we serve and he's why we're having this conversation he's why these relationships are so sweet because he designed them yeah so if anything i pray that out of this conversation you're just encouraged to draw near to the lord um as he draws near to you that josh thank you for being on my podcast this is so fun this is so funny and the first recorded podcast
