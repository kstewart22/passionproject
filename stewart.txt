food challenge I'm so excited I literally didn't even I'm not I skipped lunch cuz I was like for doing that video this afternoon and I want to pick up what we did is we got a list of fast food restaurants and I guess we're gonna let you because she's the cute one we're gonna let her pick out a fast food restaurant we're gonna go there and the challenge is you go through the drive-thru and you order what the person in front of you ordered if you really hope they get good stuff I mean I'm really picky perfect it's kind of weird kind of crazy but a lot of people are doing that nowadays so it's kind of fun we wanted to try but there's a few rules she's very picky so you might say what heaven you seem to be a loving husband so if she gets something she doesn't want you're not gonna make her eat thank you but that would be a lie because I'm going to I do love you so hey there's one bite though and at least one bite I'm excited to hear cuz she's the big one-oh    let's go I am shuffling up right now our very first that's okay whatever reference you think I'll tell you what I actually I pretty much eat the same thing at every single restaurant and and never ever change it so I'll peek from there and I'll tell you when I normally get okay yes I do no okay all right you ready make Donal oh that is a great way to start with first boy first thing that comes to mind right big Evan loves McDonald and they have onions on all their burgers and I eat onions but let me tell you the first thing that comes to mind is cheap not gonna lie this is a good video gonna be fun but I'm a newlywed man and I'm a new dad so I'm thinking budget maybe the people ordered dollar baby that's what I'm thinking okay so McDonald's is first up yeah and I'm excited about that that's a good one to start with honestly that's a good one you got fries you got sodas you got burgers you got a check yeah and onions basically come on everything no I agree with you I'm not an onion person I can't even tell you like what I even would get at mcdonnell's actually really open someone I orders an egg and cheese biscuit because I love egg and cheese biscuits I'd say they're not going to during the day I know they can but it's improbable whatever okay so here we go McDonald's we're almost there why'd you put McDonald's in there what did I just tell you oh there you are awkward honestly cuz people look at you like you're an idiot um what I want to do is order what the person that went in front of me ordered what so whoever came through this drive-thru last I want the same thing they have who ever came through laughs you want to order what they had the exact same thing yes that will Keane only ketchup I'm exam oh my back to the prize went to our doctor proof that sounds great whatever they had yeah feel like we're crazy teenagers again yeah yep thank you okay that's a literally right up her Evan was brave enough to say that because I'm sorry Evan it's like oh look the most like shy person really is this surprising yes I think double cheeseburger only ketchup that's literally right up your alley thank you it's cheese and oh no are you kidding me yeah I don't know it was a too large dr. pepper a double cheeseburger only ketchup I McDouble and a basket of fries okay McDonald's first up so glad that we actually picked me Donald's because I can do this like I can do the plain cheese burger with cheese like and dr. pepper that's evidence that's and it's honestly like she likes we're made Nance that's with it too first of all we thank you for this day and your many blessings thank you for the food please bless it to our bodies thank you for the people in front of us or in something that I could bear yes and I just I was have a great day keep us safe think okay double cheeseburger yeah but just cheese oh and ketchup that's great I mean that's a double is that a double yeah if it's the same thing and we take one bite out of one that counts right okay somehow we got away with extra food I don't understand it we this is the regular McDouble and it does have the onions and pickles so they did or did this person got only cheesy I'm gonna fill up before I get to the next place don't worry let's go McDonald's he treated us well you have to look at the camera while you pick it out oh look at the camera while you pick it out Duncan junk food then we use some coffee yes no doughnuts we'll see how my donut person I don't know what its gonna be yes something really good for McDonald's so I'm doing the same thing with Dunkin Donuts so Dunkin Donuts here we come for you are you ready yes I actually just want to order whatever the last person in line order if that's what they have all right thanks a medium iced vanilla chai you will like that it's chai I didn't even get to order any donut I saw a point of going to Dunkin Donuts these up Donuts Dunkin donut it's in the name baby who are these people that go and just order coffee baby I love you and I will get you Donuts another day but it's part of the challenge but I think you'll like this it's a chai tea with vanilla ot I thought it was coffee try Rafi dinger okay we just got out of Dunkin and they only ordered one thing yeah no not a chive Anila don't know any worm whatever something preference yes it was a vanilla chai iced he's like Christmas you like it it just tastes like gingerbread I'm not kidding gingerbread in a drink is what it feels like you not think of Chris okay I see no Christmas I feel what you're saying christmas is coming jingle bells jingle bells I mean literally right like gingerbread in a drink yep I mean honestly that's pretty good I mean what if I turned in do you like this adventurous guru all right you want to get in the Christmas spirit early like early early really early get this from and your Dunkin Donuts one you get to draw other half you bring a little bit it's a lot okay everyone who drew out of that rewarding me I'm a nice person okay I'm not even thinking all right is that just one date Duncan you were awesome even though you didn't give me any doughnuts anyways next stop is Burger King okay we're almost to Burger King chicken sandwich here we go oh my goodness I'm pretty sure someone just went through the drive-thru go zoom i zoom up some of them addresses right here here what they're ordered um yes so whatever that gentleman in front of me just ordered that's exactly what I want sure all righty thanks okay so we're doing a great on budget it takes a little bit of the fun out of the food I aspect he just got a frozen coke you can go ask this guy to do it what guy that guy go ask where to buy a chicken sandwich so that you can buy chicken sandwich I know but I really really really really wanna take it dammit Peggy thanks so much okay so I'm not gonna live really looking forward to a chicken sandwich but some crazy dude ordered a a what a I said that who does that at Burger King I didn't even know they sold frozen coats sir I see you and I'm disappointed in your ordering skills thanks I'm not even that good we're gonna fill up on drinks guys look like ah why in the world actually it's not no it tastes literally like a coat I mean okay so oh yeah we gotta pick the next place okay are you ready Taco Bell what is he saying oh that one's definitely not in there Oh what is it like its favorite I cannot go to talk about coz if they have beans and I eat beans and then I feed Leyla she has bad yeah so this is gonna be bad for everybody here we come Burger King you let me down okay what I normally get here is a bean burrito no onion add sour cream and I'm pretty sure no me is gonna wear that and even if they do order B Morita they're not gonna say no onion so this whole thing is about to be popped there's a car in the drive through right now okay good hurry if I can listen and they don't order what I want I'm gonna go tell him the order what I want okay so I could just tell she's leaning over two people in the car saying things and then leaning back so she's getting orders from other people so we're definitely probably definitely probably going to going to have some food on this one she might be like indecisive like I am when I'm pregnant and not okay I'm like all the time hey I'm good how are you I'm good um let's see let's just do whatever that lady in front of me just ordered okay so she got to shredded chicken out to bean burritos in the paper there that what you want that's perfect    Thank You bean burritos have onions on them unless you say no onions that did you hear or say no onions no but you could pick them out as at least no they're like tiny bits of onions everywhere close as you could get to them or during the exact thing you order now are we allowed to get sauce packets well no no we'll ask what sauce packets she got yeah oh good my weasel your way in there and we're doing a video where we order what they did in front of us so do you know what sauce she got okay part of it thanks man have a good one she didn't get sauce I love it I love that she ain't get sauce because you should be unhappy like me saying she got onions literally well does these little dee deee daaah onions did he die yeah needed eating duck leader did he died did he died did he die Taco Bell chicken melt or something check it out yeah I think I've had that I'm pretty much the Taco Bell aficionado yeah he saw some chicken it's actually really good quesadilla hot stuff David II have a slight spicy soy but she has to try the bean buried no all right I'm not Carly not a bike I ever do any ins a big bike she did that's a good sized bite I bet you she got an onion minimun gene I don't like onions I'm done girl was not Leyla loving you you just admit that you've just proved it right now tell

race pretty excited about this one as he could know she's never white away see oh okay okay there's a lot we're not gonna be able to answer all of these well yeah there's literally like hundreds of thousands millions why are you guys the best and coolest parents and people ever thank you not true music no we're not we're literally just trying to figure this whole Parenthood thing out yes not physically not like this julia w says what is your favorite bible verse o favorite bible verse there's so many of us i have to say one of my favorites is Matthew that's gonna go six 19 through 21 because it talks about laying treasure up in heaven where moth and rust don't corrupt so really just focus in on your life here making things count actually for eternity and that's something my dad always challenged us to do he was like ask yourself before you ever make a decision or do something or get involved in something how is this gonna count for me in 10 years from now or 20 years from now or even in eternity like is it worth me putting my time into and so I think that's been a huge like goal and always in the back of my mind to think whenever I'm going through something or making a decision in life like is this gonna be something that is more something in eternity yeah one of the ones I've always loved is proverbs 22:1 a good name is rather to be chosen rather than silver and gold and you know that speaks a lot to me cuz kind of just like you know a loving favor rather than silver and gold like it's not just about making money like you can make money and have a bad attitude in certain situations I have had that happen with me get caught up in trying to make money or trying to you know live the way you think you should in this life and take away from family or friends or you know just not focus on the right areas you should be focusing on is what I'm trying to say so I really like that Joby deli says how did you to me oh my goodness that's such a sweet story but it's so long oh maybe this short version and like later will give you like old videos but we pretty much met at like a church event my parents were speaking and my family used to sing back in the day and we met long story clean Hadley or something what's been the hardest thing with parents somebody's amazing in the nether night she's like yeah all night and party all so at the party Allison OTT 7 says best intentional dating advice Lydon intention so this makes like we're not even the people to give you advice well that's true but since you're here and this is intentional she's saying you give them date so it is like this is someone I want to date fo sho you know like this is not wise serious I think you're cute this is serious so I don't know probably be careful not to like get so like focused about the whole like relationship that you're in and everything in lose sight of God yes that would have to be the first date because whenever we did that in a relationship that's when it got all about us and that's when we had our little argument treatments oh well when God was the center of our relationship I feel like it was so much smoother person-to-person yes God first always that because him leading everything will go better than you leading it but person a person is I say just focus on putting the other one first because that's something that you know everybody has a hard time it's complicated especially me yeah but mostly like super strong prisons and we got married yeah super cool and set so yeah keep I'll keep the other person first selfless not selfish less of the selfish more of the selfless so small town girl 931 says would y'all ever meet fans absolutely like if you ever see us out and about hit us up you always looked it say hey have a little chat even though like we're no one to have fans so that part gets me because we're just normal people but for sure if you ever see us out and want to talk or something just come up it's no big deal so we swatch spots because least watch snorts how are y'all handling this coronavirus chaos trying not to go insane with this whole social distance yeah and sending a whole bunch of prayers out to everybody that's going through all this really what we're just taking it one day at a time it's Kali Creek like I don't know it kind of feels weird and you've never experienced anything like this um in like our lifetime yeah and so I'm like what do we do mom and dad's toilet paper has become big deal though that's right in water Caye closer says any advice for a young girl and waiting for the right guy my advice would be you know just keep waiting it out if you feel that that is God's will for you and you're waiting on the one right guy that God has for you then you'd be more miserable going for the wrong guy than just waiting for the right one so definitely keep waiting that out cambree Webster says if you had to be a piece of grass which piece would you be so I'm really glad that you watched our Instagram story and said don't ask me questions like went to your favorite color because that's boring I'm sorry not boring you thought about that one that's really cool okay whatever when I'm looking out I know what no I would definitely want to be the one that is the most great because then then you really couldn't say the grass is always greener on the other side like I'm the greenest grass that yeah that's what I'm saying Audie bear says what have y'all done to not be bored while quarantine oh my goodness okay mainly taking care of her uh-huh uh-huh watching shows cooking

and there thumbnails trying to get those looking a little better now I got to film an intro and edit that so it's all coming with slow slow time just cool intro Danielle says did Carlin purposely wait to get married until she graduated absolutely actually we debated on our wedding date like so much because of course we wanted to get married sooner and we dated for like almost like three years and so it felt like for a head birth but I was trying to finish school he was an electrician school steel um so I ended up finishing that literally like in May and got my diploma in interdisciplinary studies which is like a liberal arts degree so I have three minors in history music and religion but that being said we ended up getting married like two weeks later after like the graduation walk yeah finished my degree which is like yes aka McDaniel 84 says what church do y'all attend we actually go to Clear Springs Baptist Church area course in Tennessee yes um Church and you live near Knoxville we'd love to come visit also pastor awesome charge we have it it's Queen Victoria says who usually gets up to change her diaper okay bragging moment for my wife during the week she does most of it and that makes me sound like a bad husband but he gets up at five o'clock in the morning to go to work yes we go to bed she normally I take care of her through the night and feeder through the night I'll get up and help bur fur and selfish they don't know weekends I on Friday night since wake him up a lot okay help me cuz it's my turn to get to fall asleep but she's amazing blue eyed killer Oh seven says how do you juggle your spiritual and relationship with work and having a new baby it's definitely hard life gets so busy and we're as normal and as real as anybody else out there so there's sometimes you just we find yourself you gotta find that motivation or what not to be in the word and to go to church and to you know be faithful and it is Hartman I think it's just getting in a local church I think helps a ton and getting plugged into that church and being in the Bible every day and stuff like that just the basic things like that or what's really gonna invest in your life so you can you know have that anchored down to continue to grow in Christ I think for me like work relationship baby like no matter where you're at in life I think being in touch with the Lord in that relationship with him it's just one in the same and I think it should be you know a parent in your work with your child and with each other I think that's such a huge role to play because it really like predicts how some of your life is gonna be like when you come to difficult situations and like how are you gonna handle those who are you gonna look to for us I mean Jesus is everything and so he is definitely like our shoulder to lean on and I feel like that's what helps us do different circumstances but as a day-to-day thing it's pretty much what Evan says actually being in tune with the Lord every single day whether it's reading and praying and actually taking that time to set aside time to spend time with him because bills like this skip I used to do back when I am taught like kid conferences and it was like I skidded about a marriage relationship and they basically just living the home same home but they never talked they never communicate and the picture of that was saying like there's not I mean they live in the same house like they're both there but they never communicate or talk so that's not really a relationship and I think that's the same way with the Lord and you like you have to actually communicate with them him speaking to you and you speaking to him to actually have a relationship like it's not just knowing a husband or knowing of God or oh he lives inside my heart or you know my husband lives inside my house relationship it is a relationship it's constant communication and I think that's the only thing that can actually ground you and your spiritual walk with the Lord and so I think that's a huge huge I can go and so it's death through that but that's just a little something to encourage you to like don't give up like it's as simple as relying on him yeah so anyways I think we're gonna call it quits right there guys like see she's like tired and yawning like she's getting anxious she's ready to go thank you guys so much for watching I hope you enjoyed the Q&A just kind of getting to know us a little better I loved reading all your questions and everything y'all were so sweet it was awesome we hope everybody stays safe do this crazy time in our worship now we're sending lots of prayers your way for those effective it's a good talk she was super interested alright see you next week his is where I was like okay he's really into me and I

have slightly different versions of the story so we'll just go back and forth okay so you interrupt me and all we're great at that okay yeah we do that already so okay we met her family probably nine years ago something like that nine to ten years ago they came to our church in Springfield Tennessee was her dad would go around preaching and their whole family go around singing great so they came to our church did their thing and that's when we first met the family okay so Evan I remember this speak at you I do remember that your sisters came up Tarpeian they were talking to Tori and ELISA and you were like this blue-eyed short kid luck with blue braces you know going through your teenage years you had to say short and that's like the only like thing that I remember that whole visit I was really young I was like what was that I had to be like 13 I was like 16 you were 13 but I'm the only thing she remembered from my business you just heard her say hey I don't think si I remember his mom cuz I thought she looked really classy and I remember that y'all had CDs like family so we like are you kidding me they sing and we were like a bunch of nobodies right whatever it was great then time went on and you want me to jump in here yeah so time went on a few years past we would visit like her dad's Church he was a pastor if we were ever in Gatlinburg we'd visit them or something we'd see them every one so yeah it's all of those times prenup Murthy was late two or three times I was actually out of town every time they came to visit yeah missions trips and I was also in a relationship prior I was like not interested in and at this point she was still a little bit younger than me and at that age you know I wasn't really thinking about that either also funny story actually someone even tried to set him up with my sister for oh wow because I was already like talking to trouble in yeah and that's hilarious like we look back and we laugh about it went on to where it really jumps straight to this yeah my church happened a few more you are your two paths yeah it was I believe September 17 2016 my church was having a ladies conference had they asked her mom to speak at you know at this point you know it had been several years since we've met them she's grown up she's probably like 18 ah yeah yeah hey we followed everybody on Instagram I followed her and at this point right so keen so I'm kind of like man this girl's gotten cute I'll tell you that much so I was like very attracted in the very pretty face type category and so I knew that they'd be coming because her mom was speaking and our church does something where they get a lot of the teenage guys to help some of the older guys in the church and we served the ladies at the ladies conference so I was like mmm I'm getting me on that guy's service okay so this particular trip I and some of my sisters weren't gonna end up going yeah and I just assumed she'd be there yeah last minute we ended up going to small ones like oh come on it'll be great ladies you mayn't kid you know yeah meet friends whatever it was in between our I'm gonna say either mid times yeah oh it was me it was sometimes it was something big we're studying so I was like okay we'll go and in between sessions like we'll study in the back or something if you know they'll be time for us to study I had my friend she braided be like cornrows in the side of my head I liked it and I just like got this like new hair saw and I thought it was so cool and my sister was like you should do that she's like it's like super like classy and everybody's in heels and super fancy like that cornrows or whatever you want to call it looked a little casual yeah cash so I said oh my goodness I like love them so I'm doing them so I was like here's the deal I said if I get like ten compliments on it I'll know that I made the right decision and she was like okay deal yada yada it was literally like a fun like sister competition we showed up to the face yes now at this point I am there serving with the guys I mean I'm expecting her I guess I really don't know if she's showing up I just assumed like that all the girls would come with them so I'm there serving with the guys and I look up in the cafeteria at Southaven Baptist Church in Springfield Tennessee and I see the most gorgeous brownish-blond brownish blondish haired girl walk in brown skirt white blouse yeah I still remember it yeah and I see her and I'm like man she is so cute like from afar and I'm the kind of guy like I'll talk to anybody but if I think you're cute hmm I get like Oh I can't see anything so I didn't say anything so I start walking by get all the trays of food they're still standing like in the 4-year area of the cafeteria cuz everybody's greeting his family hi yeah cuz we knew him yeah like we weren't strangers we knew the family but now I just thought she pretty it was so funny so he kept walking back and forth back and forth and Mike it was obvious to me I was like like you like turn red when he came near me he was just like super awkward I went to high say in timeout for all the people that are gonna fuss and be like sounds like heaven we liked her because she's pretty that's so shallow at this point y'all yes okay I had not talked to her much like ever so I didn't know her personality or her Christianity I just hope she was a good Christian hope she had a good personality haha but I saw that throwing that out there yeah I'm on number two so I'll let her number okay so finally we're all sitting there and I'm like like this is crazy like it's obvious he keeps walking backwards I'm gonna be like the super I don't know where this confidence came from and I'm walking by I'm walking by with a tray a cinnamon rolls yeah hey hey stranger aren't you going to say hey I still like what you know and he's like yeah so really she said in first job she blurted and she said I don't know where the girl finance came from because it was not I know where the confidence came from it wasn't confidence because she didn't care jump to the part where she told me she wasn't getting lucky the whole weekend after I said it I thought whoa in my head like all these amazing okay that was super like confident where'd that come from and I'd remembered that I had followed him on Instagram before but I had just got an Instagram and I thought the Instagram like notified him if you like unsubscribe you're unfollowed you only followed me for dubsmash you something guys remember that because I made funny dubsmash is something wrong Larry's been ice up my cat my head off so that was her excuse for unfollow me so literally the next in its out of my mouth was I unfollowed you on Instagram yeah I'm like wow shot now you're just gonna like okay and I'm like you stop posting funny videos so whatever and he was like oh so if I start practicing funny videos will you follow me back on the really good part a really good part what I went to throw away my stuff into trash can and Evan I must have broke the ice that conversation must have did it for him because when I went to throw away something you were thrown away something you came up behind me to throw away something you were like I like you're like brave thing and you and I'm like oh really this is no coincident but that was the tenth compliment that day oh my I was number two and she told her sister if I get two compliments you know all that so that day she was just studying while they were doing the classes and stuff so we talked on and off whatnot but since we knew the family our church the ones that were kind of in charge of the ladies conference they asked my family to take them out to dinner that night so we went to our local Japanese place which we went to all the time when we were dating yeah so that was our first dinner date Japanese well out of date day to me it was so those are my sister Erin mm-hmm like really push it and was like the first one was like oh you should like date this guy we're sitting at the table she has Evan what did she say she was like you're single right Evan and all-in he was like yeah yeah and she's like all Colin is too cuz she just got dumped yeah Erin was so straightforward and then she like under the table like peachy they're like pinching later on laughing dear I'm afraid then that was pretty much the night we actually drove back to the hotel and sat in the lobby and talked that cuz Josie was there too and she was like taking photos my sister and then Sunday morning Sam flirted big I did not anymore not even register in my mind Sunday morning is the big deal I actually led the scene in our junior Church Father so I made them I really got morning in the four-year and that already makes me feel like we're practically like a couple because they asked me to take them to Sunday school class so I sat back and waiting I don't know maybe I pull it and so I found them in the lobby walked him to our Sunday School class and then after that I was like well I've got junior Church so I won't be able to sit in the service so I'll probably see y'all afterwards she says her dad's the guest speaker at our church this okay well if you happen to get out early or something I'll save you a seat no I said wheels Lindsay and she tells me that this day she said I didn't even heart with you that weekend and I'm like well honey I don't know because I should so needless to say I did get out of junior church early somehow and ask nothing oh yeah and you were in that blue like sparkly suit jacket thing to you after Sunday after Sunday - some of them ended up at our house where I was like okay he's really into me and I was like what am I gonna do like she starts getting nervous because she was like no I did not want a relationship all of his family's bragging on his car trips so Evan actually that loves to do like little magic card tricks all the time and it's so funny because he pulled out his card tricks to show me and this was him doing the card my shake when I get nervous like I still remember in my mind I could play it play it back we got in the car we wrote with them back to church and it wasn't just him either guys it wasn't just me it was like a group like kiss sisters rubber oh yeah and four sisters it wasn't I need chaperones yet dude I really knew you know it so I was like looking at him like I'm gonna be in our wedding okay so I rode with his family back to church with my other sister I think Josie someone else's like this and we get to the church and one of his sisters told me the ebon write songs and Evan and she told Evan to sing some of them Evan sang some his phone and so in other words my sisters were helping me when he sang the song that he broke it was like music speaks to girls guys I don't care if you can't sing can't play guitar I don't play any instruments I do everything a cappella when I'm just messing around it was music speaks to girls it was really good and then we went to church oh and we went into church and this is how he got my number I was like oh send me a recording of that song cuz I thought she walked right into Jana that's how the man got my number the rest of it is kind of like history to be honest it was set to God thing in my life because I was going through a lot in my life you know I'm really like learning to lean on Jesus stress stance when I was completely like trusting in the Lord and like actually letting him have full control in that area and other areas of my life it was like he showed up and walked on the seat and he was like this like perfect knight in shining armor in my life so pretty much September 17th from then on has not a day gone by that I have not talked to her or Texan anyways we dated for like three years we got engaged and then got married we have a little baby girl and little ray now and yeah the rest is history anyway hope you guys like yeah if you're still watching way to go

this Babyliss pro curling urn told you I'm really good at this and stuff          okay so welcome back to our YouTube channel welcome to my space as well because this is where I get ready every morning okay so let's get started today we are doing curly hair tutorial my hair is literally naturally this straight it's ridiculous right I know like what in the world I don't even have to flat iron it so whenever I had my hair curled it's with a curling iron so I'll show you some of my products my hair brush is the launched hair brush if you don't have this you need it it's like amazing it's like a wet brush it's right there back except - I have both of them then I use a primer protectant right now I have the Pantene not really a fan of it so if you have some better suggestions let me know below because I'm always looking for some good hair products and this one's not my fav like it's good but you know it's just like average and then oh stole my mom's hair's break-in yay for me it's almost going this is my favorite hairspray so mom you know if you have another extra one laying around this one's almost empty so yeah also a curling iron this I got for Christmas and it's my favorite so far I don't even know what brand it is you guys this is terrible Oh baby lists Pro I think that's whatever I'll just show you up close this is what the curling iron says got the curling iron and this is also I want to say it's a one-inch I kind of almost what up size to like one and a quarter for my hair if you have long hair I feel like the bigger your curls the better it looks but this one don't make it last a little longer but then I've tried a one in half notes too big because my curls don't laugh at all but yeah this one's my favorite got it for Christmas so it was a great Christmas gift yeah so that's about it so I got out of the shower I normally let my hair like air dry and then like the last May a few minutes of it I will blow dry just to talk to make sure it lays right and then I'll kind of just like brush it all out so I'm gonna start with this heat tamer heat primary or whatever you call it I always like to get the underneath the lock it's for some reason my underneath is like the worst like I feel like it's more damaged so I'm just all over kind of brush it out to make it dry I also have like major problems with like this being like stick straight flat like see what I mean so I normally use a texture spray um but I ran out and you know what we're in this social distancing thing so I have no way to get it so yeah Deanna we're just gonna skip that step of the texture spray but I do recommend a texture spray because it literally will make your curls last longer and you'll have more body up here some people section off their hair I don't because it's not as fast for me I actually literally just throw it in the back and I will start with the left side then I get smaller pieces in this front area you can kind of see it's like maybe an inch and a half wide maybe and then alright here's my fast way my favorite way I will show you sometimes I do use my curling iron like a wand and I will wrap it up like this which is what I was saying and I'll leave about an inch inch or two out at the bottom I'll hold it drop it cool the curl and that's the kind of curl you get with it and I do love that one but it just takes me longer to do it so I do like the regular curling iron a lot more with it and then I'm gonna do it regular just so you can see so all my hair matches so I'm putting about halfway down and I go ahead and start rolling and then I just slide it down and I like to leave that about an inch inch and a half maybe two really just varies in the don't pull it up as your girl can I fill it to see when it gets kind of hot kind of lets me know when to let it out or not I kind of section off with my fingers like the top section and the bottom section because I don't actually section it section it with a hair bow and everything it just adds time and now that I have a baby I don't have time it's like trying to fix your hair between feedings and her sleeping and waking up so if you want your curls to last longer too you can always just kind of like pull them off by scrunching them up or you can bobby pin them as I said that takes longer to sew on a fan I have to start in the middle because one my layers the hair will fall out because of my layers so that's why I start lowering side down and then also it's not as damaging to my ends because you have all the heat underneath everything on the ends when you do it    don't do that that will make your curls really bad so make sure that you pull it down to the bottom and then you turn it so you're not like crimping it the wrong way okay so once I get about halfway around my head I will pull all of this half in front and I'll toss this on back so they can cool more like individually if they're still hot and then I'll start working from the back and I'll just toss the girls come on if you have asked also how I dye my hair or what not I do I have this awesome lady in Knoxville and she does my hair Whitney told me about her her name's Anna and I actually get a balayage so that way I only have to do it like twice a year and it grows out kind of on its own kind of naturally I've tried a lot of crazy things with my hair I've had like burgundy I've had like super dark black I've had brown I've had like super blonde it's not a good look for me but whatever no I'm back to like my natural Brown but then I add just a slight bit of highlights for a little more definition and since it's almost spring what is spring now I add just a little bit of color you can kind of see it up close makes it a lot easier less upkeep with the balayage and it's also not as bad on your hair so I'm a fan    I'm with the top layer I try and roll it all the way to the top and I kind of point it back because I don't have a lot of body and so it kind of adds me a little boost back there when I do that this is the trickiest part for me it's like the last like bangy part because I always try and make that curl like lay right so I just kind of let it cool kind of pull it forward up by my ribs and then I'll just curl it like there are others backwards sometimes I have to redo that one like twice but like the it doesn't like to do what I want it to do I do not do anything I run my hands through it until all of my curls are like cooled because they will fall out so I'm just kind of like a weight on them kind of scrunch them up if they're still warm some of these over here still warm so I'm just waiting on those and then I'll run my fingers through it and it kind of loosens it up a lot of times I take a comb at the end or even the beginning a lot of times it just depends and I'll try to tease a little bit of my crown and then afterwards I just kind of run my fingers through it once it's cooled easy some nice like luscious curls and then I also a lot of time to add texture spray at the end as well as the beginning because it gives you a lot more body then once you kind of run your hands through it I did not tease my crown at the start so I'm gonna he's a little bit of it right now so I just kind of backcomb it I pull up just a little bit of it and then just backcomb it it gives me a little bit of body back there especially since I don't have texture spray in it right now    so it's not much at all so don't over tease it because then give like a crazy big bump all right you guys we're pretty much done you add a little hairspray to it which I'm almost out there you have it this is my curl what do you think    alright guys so that's my pretty much everyday curl I will let it fall out just a little bit throughout the day because it's kind of a little tight I mean I like mine just a little bit looser and then it'll ask me about day to day two and a half days all right thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed the curly hair tutorial and maybe you can try it let me know how you like it if I taught you anything at all okay anyways thanks for watching again and I'll see you next week okay guys welcome back to the vlog I have to talk

somewhere well she started running a fever tonight and getting even worse so we called them back they said if it was them they'd go on to the to the ER so look at us three weeks in all the stuff we went through with Leila and now we are heading back to the ER for Carlin you know Lord will and it won't be much maybe it's just something simple but they said it could be the flu it could be anything so Carla's got her sisters over here helping us we're loading up we're gonna head to the ER and she's literally like she's totally out of it pain barely can talk doesn't want any noise no lights all the all stuff that comes with a headache Carlin you know her getting better so first priority so we are heading to the hospital in Knoxville Carlin I mean you can tell she's out of it but she's burning up all over she has had a migraine for over 24 hours straight walking out the door she honestly just collapsed she was so dizzy she started leaning back and fallen to the floor and I was able to get to her but we're just really worried we don't know what it is alright we are back in a room now you can see for yourself she's not feeling too great I feel like dead that's about it Oh you    you    so they're worried that the migraines and stuff could be coming from her epidural can due to some type of thing the epidural can have side effects even you know up to a couple of weeks or a few weeks after to where it gives him the headaches and stuff so the doctor did a spinal tap or something like that I don't know if I'm saying these phrases right but he got the spinal fluid to come out and it was clear so that they said that was a good sign but they are testing that right now we're not really sure we don't really know what's going on just yet still waiting to hear back from all the tests and there she is kind of waking funding so our faces back it is yeah Leila's out there with her sister at elite because the doctor said he just after he kind of got the idea that it could possibly be an infection inside and he said he wanted to get the baby out of here so Adil he's watching Leila and I've been walking in and out checking on her right now it is little past 12:20 and she's got more antibiotics to do and everything so I don't know how long we'll be here okay so the doctor came in and they actually want to admit her in the hospital so we know we'll be here for at least a day and we can't see baby Leila okay so we are now up in the hospital room they've admitted her into the hospital they're doing the blood cultures to see if there's anything maybe an infection in the blood or something they don't know we're kind of just playing the waiting game now to see what they come up with and then maybe they'll send us home and say everything's gonna be all right they were worried about Leila being around so her sister Aaron I took Leila for us so we both really miss her all right so quick update Carlin and I are actually gonna be here for a day or two they're waiting to get the blood cultures back so I'm having to head back home get maybe a few things we'll need for tonight get her breast pump because she's been nursing and she can't right now because we don't have the baby and then right back out to the hospital all right just got back up in the room and I get up here to find that Carlin's mom and dad they're out of town actually but they centered this stuff they got some balloons and flowers we even do oh it's been a rough three weeks it's gonna get over whatever this is I wished he could just tell me what's with me Aaron sent me pictures of Leila when I was given was chick is she's so beautiful look at her Oh get her sleeping she's gonna be so big when I see her again yeah so we gonna make it through this that's like I feel like every time we go home we come back so the doctor in them are just saying they really don't have an idea of what's going on thought it could possibly be bacterial meningitis and then thought if it's not that maybe just viral meningitis and then if it's not that they're kind of stumped they're kind of giving us bits and pieces as they go but they can't really tell us what it is yet I mean honestly we're here in the hospital and she could have something really bad so my sister picked up my baby last night no because he couldn't be with me because they were scared of our immune system and everything so she's been at Aaron's house and they just called us and said yeah she looks like she's not getting enough oxygen and around her like mouth and this is like blue it's like a blue tint all over and just digging really shallow breaths and really fast like she can't get your breath so it looks like    they're gonna bring her um to Children's Hospital it's like it's Evan we'll go over there with a heart so they're gonna bring her to a hospital that's literally why this hospital I can't be with her    she's gonna be okay so Aaron's gonna be heading this way here in a few minutes and I'm gonna meet her over at the other hospital one after another we don't really know what to say what to think what to do we're really worried about lailatul or do so without us being there we don't really know what's going on or what to expect but we are very worried now Lord it could be something extremely bad Lord willing it's not Lord we're just praying for a miracle to be done Lord and keep your hand upon her and protect her and help if it is oxygen levels low or if her breathing is off or wrong help the doctors to spot it and do everything they need to do to fix it and just be with Leila help her not be in pain help her to be okay and help them to get to the bottom of it and heal her and bring her back safely to us Lord Lord I just pray that you'll help Carlin as she's gone through this time Lord she's over here she can't be over with Leila and she's so got a headache and she's still hurting and they're still trying to figure out what's going on with her and it's just it's a big time in our lives Lord our family doesn't really know what to do right now just some heavy things coming down and and we don't know what to do or what to think about it so we just pray that you'll give us the wisdom we need and protect Carlin Hannah Leyland Osada just go back home as a family of three all healthy and and in one piece learn and keep us safe so we are heading to the hospital in Knoxville carlin I mean you can tell she's out of it the doctor in them are just saying they really don't have an idea of what's going on thought it could possibly be bacterial meningitis and then thought if it's not that maybe just viral meningitis and then if it's not that they're kind of stumped or picked up my baby last night it looks like they're gonna bring her to Children's Hospital       all right well I'm heading over his Children's Hospital now just told Carlin goodbye and I'm going to stay with Leila and I don't know if I'll be back and forth I guess I'll have to stay with Leila all night I don't know we'll just have to see there's our gorgeous little girl    so we're up here in the hospital room now I said we'll probably be here for a day at least try and figure out what's going on with her breathing and look at this so here's a little update I was able to get a few hours sleep altogether I guess woke up and fed her about every three hours and she was pretty good at least these last three hours she slept pretty good so she looks like she's doing okay it's about time for me to wake her up and feed her again and waiting to see what they say today they're monitoring her and kind of checking her out and waiting to see if they say we can go home or if something's something's just not right hey Leila somebody wants to talk to you get mommy over in the other Hospital    yeah she's doing so both of my girls are in the hospital we got Carlin cross at 1:00 mmm lay right across the street at another so you going back and forth well I'm not really going back and forth I've been staying with Leila but my mom dad and brother actually are driving in from Nashville to just kind of help us out I'm just to be here to help watch her and stuff so probably when they get here I'll go check on Carlin if I can and we'll see how we can work it all out       I know don't get too much sleep just quick update so my family actually came in town mom dad over there Ethan dad's trying to doze off a little bit and they got up really early this morning drove in from Nashville so they could help me out and help us out so that was a big help when we really appreciate that I'm gonna go check on Carlin over at the other hospital while they watch Leila here and we're gonna play musical hospitals for a minute so this cutie it looks like they're saying she gets to go home so the doctors saying that she has a cold that's kind of why she's been stopped up the last few days and they said that they think her breathing and kind of turning blue and trouble breathing and all that was caused just from the cold they said it sounds like she's on the tail end of the cold because she's breathing a lot better and doing pretty good so we're about to head well technically she's heading to my house with mom dad Nathan and I get to go back over and stay with Carlin at Fort Sanders cuz she won't be going home to at least tomorrow at the earliest so they're still kind of trying to find out what's going on with her so lots of crazy stuff going on hopefully mommy and daddy will be home to see her tomorrow bye Leila daddy loves you all right time for an update this girl's just trying to get better as fast as she can because I want to go home to my baby because now lay this home with Evans mom at least she's well taken care of and we're just like waiting it out the doctor came in over on my side last night was still kind of rough this morning was rough it's now 10:30 p.m. on Saturday we've been here a while now doctor came in this morning and said that he thinks it's some type of meningitis I'd say that meningitis meningitis don't quote me on that anyways so they are waiting for blood cultures to come back which should be done tomorrow they're trying to see if any bacterial infections grow to determine exactly what it was but they've been like filling me up with all kinds of antibiotics and fluids so today I feel so much better I ate like my first full meal I've been waiting got me like McCallister's and I feel so much better like other than a shower I'm ready I think I can stand up long enough to get a shower now without falling over and getting dizzy so yeah I'm almost there so they said possibly tomorrow if everything looks good I can go home anything you in town so I'm getting out of here right now because they literally just came in and literally I signed the papers in two seconds I'm really about to walk out the door because I miss my baby so much so tell me what the doctor said when he came in this morning doctor said everything was clear all the blood cultures were normal had aseptic meningitis and all the blood cultures came back normal the spinal tap everything came back normal how's your head I could tell right there I think I'm just weak so I just gotta been laying in a bed for three four days it's been a rough go yeah I think it just goes literally wiped me out yeah like completely out yeah I feel so weak but but we're going home yes care about my baby but we do get to go see baby let's go you ready to go see Layla yes we changed Alden all this so she got a bath at her family's house so thanks mr. Bates for the advance and I saw Layla in the hospital but Carlin has not seen her since Thursday night when they had to send her out of the emergency room so here we go you see let's take downs in here Marcy's a champion she's a she's totally different she's a ton and I didn't even get to tell her by because I didn't know that they were gonna make her leave or they were just like that we were gonna stay I thought all would just be on you know 30 minutes yeah and like impact my face wow you're a lifesaver seriously I'm not kidding I would not have known what I would have done we were racking our brains who's gonna watch her who's gonna keep her everybody was busy here and they jammed up and everything but she kept she woke up a lot with a lot of boys we do better in the other one okay I mean two times no she got four times yeah y'all sound like I'm like going long last night and she's like she woke up six five four ounces Wow and the family's back together so thanks for watching guys this has definitely been a crazy few days very emotional but praise the Lord it looks like both my girls are gonna be okay I got a subscribe no you can just say love you bye see you next week    Charlie Chaplin somebody dad's mocking the outfit I know you gotta stand out now you got a lock start walking that's what I had to go in Cracker Barrel like this to get their lunch what just happened baby all right what's up guys um today I'm feeling a little rusty okay it seems like it's been a while since we've logged it is Wednesday April 29th when we're filming this and this is coming to you guys this Saturday so like we've just been busy you know we haven't had much going on but I'm excited because we got a little - I like to call it a toy I get excited about random things so we ordered a little toy online and it's the perfect day for it so I'm gonna try and find it and I'll show you guys this is you're gonna love it okay I don't know where we put it I gotta find it first    Begg do you know where the umbrella is that makes more sense than the bench by the door    she doesn't like my umbrella she's looking at me like I'm a freak okay I mean look the tag is still on it so this is not like just a hoax or clickbait or what-have-you this is real like I ordered this and I'm excited in have a good umbrella so I was like we're doing this and believe it or not look at that today's the perfect day for it it's wet and it's rainy so let's get this thing open I got to take the tag off though wait wait for the best part dude what a letdown they're supposed to like jolt off that's all this one does is it broken okay good it's still sprinkling enough babe all right we're gonna test this out as you can tell we're trying to find fun things to do during quarantine it's the little things it really is bad about took my nose off that was great I don't make it back alive send somebody to my umbrella I'm singing in the rain just see I'm happy again so fun well we're dorks on quarantine this is bad okay actually it's the real reason we're vlogging today is okay first I can't even wow you think that's crazy it's very crazy you know if you can sit in the rain right now hi cutie pie you look at you sitting up all big your dad's being a dork out why what is this you need to fit bitty your little fat belly hey we get working on your hair man oh that's the best part in today's video I'm probably gonna be bald I don't think he's probably gonna be really getting you can impress your it's gonna be a hard part and everything you're probably gonna be hard part of how they look with you hair I need a haircut you wanna watch dad get probably ear cut by mom you're not laughing today you normally smile for daddy can't you smile free daddy can you smile for daddy we're gonna have to cut her out of this video she's just not smiling enough I'm just kidding I never get you out there you go you kids love you right here you show me what sides guards that you're oh I don't know I don't remember what they do one that's pretty short low and I'm scared what you're gonna do I've actually done this well I attempted to do this before but then I gave up okay so I borrowed these hair cutting thanks for mom but she actually has like three and firm in her back which one looks the best we'll use that one second you're gonna use a whole yeah you got a pretty Gong on him did you pick a guard this is gonna be bad give him a 360 look before we get going    okay I think Leila crying is going to make Carlin look back at her and then she's gonna cut my ear off or something so we're gonna put her down for now it must be really desperate for me to cut your hair because I've cut about one and a half hair cut it gets the first one I cut what you have brother Jackson's need some help uh this little guard thing fell off when I we shouldn't miss have been in your resume or something he had a massive bug right Wow yeah it was pretty bad in the second time one time I've tried to cut Evans because I've like won't want to be cool like you know all those she gave up after like a fourth of it and told my sister so now that we're in this desperate state because of her I'm gonna make myself proud no I'm thinking her if you push harder it gets more of it right did you hurt yourself no I thought I had the garden and instead I couldn't that feels like you're taking a lot you should probably spray water on it and pull it up like the barbers do and really separate everything why are you laughing it's kind of alternative Abba and it kind of like jump and don't do a fade I want to do fade I'm good with Fame look at me you doing the top what nobody ever does that on the top do they don't they always just use scissors on the top how kids scare babe I don't know oh no I'm just writing it around and around I have no idea you're the one cutting it I mean I'm wrong I seen somebody do this though so we click on the line in it kind of makes it lose that out it makes it look so drastic what just happened baby let me see what happened turn it off turn it off no I just how to fix a bad haircut it was more of a video for me is the dart on there I think that's the wrong one where was the one I was using I can clean it out babe I promise she literally just picked that because remember we said we had multiple of the shears or whatever you want okay you just picked up the one with sitting on a counter that didn't have a guard on it and she said it's just that bad what this so you're gonna have to take it all that short now or at least that far up it goes up to here right you just did it with no guard so it has to match you feel like you're pushing harder and without a guard that scares me Plus be careful isn't it easier to cut people without a guard no I don't either okay well I think it's fun what an adventure right what else are we gonna do in the house it's not like anybody's really gonna see me and it's not because I don't really have friends it's cuz of course pretty bad I'm not sure what to do when you get to the crown part because I didn't finish watching the video so I just kind of like maybe you should get a cone okay I think most people do it with their fingers they used to come while they comb it but then though they feel through and hold it with their fingers you're just reaching in and cutting wherever you can find    whoa whoa I'm gay how about I go get a shower I'll style it and then we'll come back and let him see it I think it looks great oh great all right we'll be right back okay she's saying for me to turn it back home before I go show her off I guess she thinks she didn't do a good job it's hard for me to tell I don't really know a good hair day wow she's really dying laughing gee thanks no I love it let's go Carlin wanted to style it herself hey and you did a hard part really well that one thing I'm proud of all that it's lights down just a little way thank you I think you take great I'm pretty proud of this at least much maybe by the time we're out and you can actually go get your hair fixed like it'll look alright you don't look too close it looks alright you know what Frank we are making the best of what we can with this quarantine so it really has she's critiquing it I think it looks great oh our perfection so I always predict it but I think she did amazing oh wow she literally has never been to school for this or anything that was like straight up boom her just being talented so I'll take I do want to say thank you so much for the encouragement over the last two vlogs you guys are like true supporters they DM some messages it was a really hard place in our lives and I just feel like you guys lifted us up and said all the prayers and in her own words yeah you really meant the world to us so thank you for following our story it we'll see you next week her oxygen level was at 80% she was laying on Evans chest like perfectly fine in a great position I picked her up and I was just like freaking out yes it was like a why and stuff and I was like oh no what do we do like we've never been in a situation like this before       okay so we just had probably the scariest thing that ever happened in our lives um I feel like I've cried all my tears we're freaking out a little bit but everything is gonna calm down a little bit and we thought we'd get everybody an update so we've been staying in the house for the virus and everything going on right now just trying to stay safe and not expose other people or us get exposed this morning we woke up everything was cool she was fine a little backstory was you know from the last video that we went to the hospital for me and then she ended up having to go to the hospital for her breathing they took a whole lot of tests they said her EKG levels were a little whacked up and so they sent us to a follow-up appointment with the heart doctor we went to that appointment we didn't end up vlogging it just because I don't know everything was just kind of dramatic and stressful in the moment so we went there and we found out that she had a hole in her heart and that could be a lot of the cause of it that Harry levels were whacked up but they said they just wanted to keep an eye on it and follow up later and just you know they gave us a list of lists of things fast forward to today in the past she's had a like few stairs so normally when she's eating sometimes it'll be hard to catch a breath that kind of normal she was a preemie but today we were just chilling around the house we worked out this morning everything was okay so we sat down we ate lunch and we're gonna watch a TV show we sat down and that's when it got kind of freaky because after we found out about her heart we ordered a stop monitor called like the owl and it's like monitors her o2 levels and beats per minutes yeah so it alarms you if it's you know her oxygen levels are bad and yada yada so all of a sudden her monitors started going like crazy off beeping red first time it's ever gone beeping red and gone down and it said that her oxygen level was at 80% she was laying it on Evans chest like perfectly fine in a great position and so we let I picked her and I was just like freaking out and it was like Hawaii and stuff and I was like oh no what do we do like we've never been in a situation like this before it's so got on the phone we called I got my mom ready like like we got to write see when we do we melt like Colin went one so she calls 911 one my sister she lives like a mile down the street so she rushed over here by the time she got here her she was kind of like still with our chicken stuff but she was kind of back um turn in pink and says she was holding our for us while the emily's came I was trying to calm myself because everything was kind of like in a moment I feel like a whole world was about that like turned upside down they got here and they checked her out which she was doing a ton better her levels were back up her oxygen levels at 80% for about nine minutes by the time they got here like they were yeah they went back up into 99 into a hundred by the time the ambulance got here her levels had gone back up so when they came in they checked her out listened to her lungs and everything they said she seemed fine and with the viruses going around and everything they were almost saying maybe it's not best to take her to the ER now that she seems fine but they said you should call your doctoring in their opinion yes what the virus going on everything so scary cuz if we did take her in and then she catches that or something else up in the language so we're just kind of like praying like what should we do so he called our pediatrician and we talked to her and they were like well you should probably bring her in but they didn't want to bring her in tonight because they've had a lot of six patients and already and so they didn't want her to catch anything else since she is still under two months so they booked her for the first appointment in the morning and they just said to keep a really good eye owner if it goes back down in her levels and she gets like that or she's super like dark and whatnot that Diccon I'm on one take her in immediately because they said there's definitely got to be a reason if it does happen again you just don't know like why earth is just with her heart anyways so that's a little update on our family right now our little self quarantine I don't like that we're here I don't know scary I just like Airy when they don't it's scary when you don't know what to do because if she would have stopped breathing I wouldn't have I mean you can try CPR but it's just I've realized unless you realize how fragile life is and knowing in all of that like not to fear because I know people go through like serious situations all the time and actually think that's bad and really happen and I'm like just to trust and know that like God's in control and like even with what's going on in our world right now like I feel like he's like our hope through all of this and if we keep our focus on that but literally just feel like my life was seconds away from me and turned upside down it makes you realize and treasure what you do have and to not take that for granted even the little things and my family my mom takes it out of group text in this verse he said fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help thee yea I will uphold the with the right hand that was so powerful and meaningful when your experience and something like this and if any of you guys are watching that have been through I mean situations like this or even just everything the self quarantine and what's happening right now just stepping back and taking a breath and know that God's watching over all of us keeping us safe and we're just so thankful that it wasn't anything and she's okay right now and just really praying that everything will go as planned and hopefully nothing will happen and she'll get checked out tomorrow and everything will be okay well let you guys follow along for tomorrow and see what happens then at her checkup and if they find anything it's not they said with the hole in our heart it is smaller and they said it is common but it's then like they have to keep an eye on and see if they want to do something later and it's not like I don't know I feel like I'm just rambling because I'm so like I got this I mean it's so scary with I was literally just holding her like this and I'm like knowing that she's funny we didn't know who was freaking me out so sure stay calm Evans like so much more calm Haitian because I just don't like her feel like a house right now I just don't know what to do I'm trying to just think how can we fix this what can we do so I'm more calm in the situation but she's so little I'm like you just don't know what's happening she's gonna keep praying keep a really good eye on her through the night I'm not gonna sleep tonight yeah that's what I was buying and then we'll see what happens tomorrow I guess keep praying okay so it's the next morning we are on the way to her follow-up appointment last night we kept really close eye on her she seemed to be fine she didn't have any oxygen levels dropped through the night she seemed like completely okay so it was just like this weird just brand new thing I haven't stayed up with her till like 4:00 in the morning yeah he's pretty tired because it's really early this morning and they wanted us to be like the first patients in so there wasn't other sick patients and just with everything going on hopefully they'll figure out like what was going on because I know like it was pretty serious thing we've ever went through it was just those few minutes of that scary instance and ever since then she's been back to normal so I just don't know I feel like this morning we like slept in like I know kind of getting back together and trying to like contemplate everything that went on because we were just so flustered yesterday and so like torn out of the frame because we've never like experienced anything like that before scary scary stuff so I just hope they like figure out what's going on if something is wrong like they figure out what it is and we can get it taken care of or if it's just her heart and that's what causes everyday yes but at least we'll have like something to pinpoint and make sure that it's nothing else it's going we probably can't film too much in there but we'll try and update you when we get out if not in there let me get her told you she's got that weird fetish wanting to carry you 20 pounds taker right quick update she weighs almost two pounds okay nine point seven nine to be exact almost team Pam she's so cute they checked her oxygen level if I could hear two she listened to her so they're gonna send the doctor in here in a few minutes I'm gonna see what the doctor has to say all right we are done with the doctor's appointment baby won't tell him it looks like all of her like things came back fine her vitals she was back breathing fine had no temperature she does have a lot of like acid reflux and stuff or that they think they think that could be part of it that could be part of it mix with like of course our heart being weaker I guess I don't know but they're just kind of like keep an eye on it if it happens again take her to Children's Hospital but it's just one of those things that I don't know maybe scary time scary moment like for the both of us yeah but they don't see any like actual really bad sign of like okay she need we know it's this so they're gonna put her on some acid reflux medicine for like her choking and stuff and we're just gonna like waiting thing my ear yeah so that's a little update on Miss Leila ray thanks for watching I guess we're gonna end this vlog right now go home and keep it closer so we

we're gonna like flog it for you guys but with everything happening right now I think we're gonna like have to postpone it and we don't know like how long things are opening up but it's not like fully open or anything so eventually we're going on an anniversary so anyways but we thought that we'd kind of like reminisce our wedding day that it was like almost exactly one night I go crazy it's kinda like sad it was looks so magical I was just like we shared like behind the scenes and stuff but you guys I was just telling Carla I was like I wish we could go back and like enjoy it even more cuz everybody always says this but your wedding day is so rushed and you like forget everything you're not paying attention to the people and everything you're just running ragged but it was such a beautiful wedding so like maybe these pictures will help us reminisce yeah it was awesome okay so I we're gonna go through our favorite and we're gonna cast them up on the screen so you can see a lot of the ones we're talking about as well and we're just gonna go through chat about them let you know some behind the scenes and whatnot 20,000 photos they're like magical my photographer was unbelievable she was unreal I have some videos of our herself I hug your wife I mean you you can okay you may kiss your bride but nothing you may kiss your bride tomorrow this time you may kiss your bride and this was probably like it was I don't know I feel like it set the mood for like our whole wedding day and it was a song he is here and it was just so magical but in the show it aired on up TV but it's copyrighted should've had to like mock songs over it but it was so gorgeous I got pictures of the house that Karlin had like fully prepared I mean what an amazing soon-to-be wife that I moved down more like the whole house decorated and everything I came a couple times to help paint and whatnot but she did like her and her siblings did like all of it look you can even see your bridesmaid gifts and stuff under the coffee table okay let's just move on to the wedding day that morning the venue Casselton farms it was unbelievable it was so gorgeous like you felt like you were in a magical place but they had a gun range for all the guys to go shoot out so some of the guys went in shotguns there but before we actually started getting ready I went downstairs to meet Evan he had wrote a song for our wedding and we actually had this recorded it's on iTunes and Spotify you can check it out it's called show you I do but he wrote this song for our wedding for us to sing a duet to which we hadn't hardly practiced well literally he gets in rehearsal day I'm still like learning the words and the tune to the song I am not even kidding you like in on a Bible I'm it was like so nerve-wracking so I'm trying to learn the harmony the first is the words Daniel his brothers playing it and it was like super stressful so that morning like that's all that was on my mind we're literally now down that song practicing that morning the morning of our wedding    we got a whole bunch of photos on the balcony all the bridesmaids flower girls and then of course my mom I have to say about my mom this wedding would not have been pulled off without my mom she was like number one planner coordinating everything she was like I feel like it was the most bonding time for my mom and I we spent so many hours planning this magical day and I think I kind of like understand her more now at Leila's here I mean she just came like full-on mama bear like everything's gonna be perfect for my girl and it was so sweet like I look back in this we're like the sweetest memories of my mom we also had another photographer taking photos of the guys so this was Darien and Aubrey were my photographers they were awesome shoutout to you you killed it here's some of the guys photos you were so handsome like I cannot even well that was fun you and your glasses this is so sweet they even threw him up like I should have totally done that that was cool that is so cool you gotta trust your groomsmen to do that yeah there's some some with his dad look how happy you are and then was like beaming all day it was so sweet and then this ceremony right before the ceremony started planning my wedding and picking out my wedding dress was something my mom and I did and it was gonna be like a surprise thing for my dad to show him like my dress on my wedding day and so he had not seen any of it if you like know a back story my dad and I are super close I get all the crying's sentiment Oh from him all the big moments in life and so I had planned to do like a first look with my dad I just kept pushing it off all day because I was like I already had my makeup on I'm gonna bust out crying like I gotta push it off I gotta push it off and last minute like the girls are like you're gonna regret it if you don't do it just do it and like just try not to cry try your vest so literally right before we go to walk down I walk out on the balcony with my dad and I had like a gift for him and like I didn't graped on his tie like a little embroidered I guess you'd say on his tie like always your little girl and gave him a gift and the tie clip and we just like we're doing all that we could to not cry like we were bawling it was like this you know cry I did cry and my makeup and I'm freaking out and the girls are like I mean the weddings already started people are already walking down and they're like alright we got a rush down Erin and Whittier there they're grabbing my dress so me and dad are just like doing all we can to not cry so that was like super sweet so then right before I walked down my matron-of-honor and we had like a prayer together and I feel like that says such a mood of like calmness and a peace because I was so terrified it was like the most exciting but like thrilling and nerve-wracking thing then all the guys walked down my little groove Minh and then Evans nieces they were so sweet looks so beautiful in their own dresses of course my brother Jed oh my goodness I was standing up on there before I walk down these massive steps and all I could see was Evan like afar off and it was like in that moment I felt like it was just him and I standing there like nobody else around it was just so mad there's really no words to describe it so like I was standing in the middle with the perfect view and here she comes with this big long flowy dress it slowed me down the big staircase I mean first of all yeah first of all the place is just gorgeous I mean we loved it second of all she literally looked like Cinderella walking down into the ball like I'm not kidding the dress go back she was so beautiful and I couldn't help it I started crying right then and there so sweet and if you know Evan he's not a crier so that was a big deal but his pastor he married us but my dad gave like the charge the wedding charge but his pastor couldn't be there for the rehearsal I have a video trying to explain to my pastor like what we were talking about the night before because first of all he's done a lot of so he knows what he's doing but still he was not able to be there the night before and so that made us all a little bit nervous so we were like cinemas back and forth and stuff like that um when she sets down the song will change to some song I'm not sure yet and when that song changes that's our cue to walk outward back here behind the stage so he's sitting in for you this is Carla's brother then it'll be me then Ethan so we will all just walk right this way and then came the scary part mmm what's so terrifying when we had to sing and it wasn't beautiful it was so sweet like I'm so glad we did it so glad we did it so there's some photos of that I mean it was the most magical day it was all so hot but thankful the crowds stuck that out and then oh my goodness running out of that place just about like I can't believe they grabbed that heel click perfectly and then running out of there like once we got up the steps it was like I felt like I was on cloud 9 she ran off like a free bird oh I see does that happen we started taking family photos that's me doing the dab because that was legit pictures with the pastor yeah little flower girls I had a huge wedding party but you know what I literally love it because there's they're all like our best friends and family's always there and it was just I thought it was so sweet to have everybody there so it was totally worth having a huge bottle party and then after we got all of those shots we moved on to just our photos while everybody went to eat in the reception wow those were like magic this day was just so magical you might as well pause here for a long time because she's gonna want me to throw up a lot of these photos I know these are amazing there was so much fun he's wound in the grass and this is actually like the cover of our single that we released show you I do that we sang at our wedding this is in front of the whole world huge home where we got ready then we move on to the reception Wow the cake is gorgeous that's my aunt I barely remember that cuz like we were over there oh no I don't even think I got to eat it yeah we were starving we didn't eat it all man we finally ate when we left we had a car in the car so I totally wish I would have smashed them all on your face like I tried my best thing there was I told her I said whatever you do is what I'm gonna do oh and he really did give me she put a little on my face so I came back with a little on her face but she says I put more in her face yeah okay then we had our matron of honors and best man give a speech so they gave speeches it was super sweet Ethan cracked me up we laughed hysterically and then from that we went to I think the sweetest part besides our song we sang to each other we went to do our first dance and Wow brother Lawson sang a song and I it was awesome we did a dance which disclaimer here number one I'm not a dancer I don't know how to do we took the other classes like right before our wedding because I thought it was so sweet mainly with just my dad and I him and I probably took to dance because he was out of state so he can't come in but when all this happened everything was so rushed that I didn't bustle my dress and also I took off my heels because I thought it'd be easier to dance it so therefore my dress was over the dress the hold I was super long and I didn't bust it cuz nobody my um I think like I don't know nobody knew how to bust it or something so yeah but the pictures are beautiful that's all that matters right that's right NLS sweet it was sweetheart and then my dad and I we did a dance and of course I cried through the whole thing it was so sweet I do it twice like the first three throws like a dud just realized it yeah it was something it sounds like give it to me again so that I fit in clothes heading out there's the sprinklers that'd be bad that's a great way to leave we should have done that the spark the sparklers okay funny backstory here we go here's a back story for you you see that green beautiful Mustang that's a Mustang right yes okay well my mom and I I want to say like two weeks maybe a week before our wedding we were shopping and our shop trying to get last-minute stuff and we showed up at the mall and then we're having this huge car like a car show so yeah that's what you'd call it a car show and I was like we'd not decide what we're gonna leave in yet because all the cars were like super expensive to rent and went right right before your wedding you're adding up all this stuff you have to pay for tog refer your debate you know your musicians your preacher and it's just like adding up and I'm like we're just gonna have to leave nothing because I we just can't spend the money on something else it's like so expensive just to drive away in like to rent a car and so I'm like I am gonna March over there and ask one of these people to let me borrow your car literally me and my mom walked around the whole car show picked out all kinds of cars we liked and we talked somebody into letting us use their car they shown it turn wedding day let it literally he's amazing he showed up cleaned it I mean he keeps this thing immaculate it was so cool and we left in the mud sea and let us like tecar ate it and everything it was so cool it was awesome it was super cool and it matched our wedding like the color green was like perfectly cuz yeah I was magic and then we all ran out of course with the sparklers sparklers you can't say anything okay that was the best feeling was leaving that wedding it was like so exciting Wow and then there were so many people this day or maybe it was just my family your family and it felt like so many people and so there are some photos of us in the car as we left and we're like stuffing our starters yeah my mom had somebody packed like food in there for us to eat on our way to like the hotel because we're like stuffing our faces and that's about it then it's off to the honeymoon in the Dominican Republic which that'll have to be another day yeah we should actually tell him about our honeymoon we should be happy actually shared a whole bunch of stuff about anything we totally should it was pretty magic but we'll save that for another video that was pretty much our day that's a very short glimpse of what went on and it was so exciting it was just gorgeous like it was a dream come true honestly so what would be your absolute favorite part of the whole day even though it was nerve-wracking I'd probably have to say the best memory is singing the song together I mean it's just you don't get more romantic than that okay I'm gonna tell you my favorite moments but I can't just have one favorite oh well I didn't know that okay so first off yes this song was magic just walking down seeing you leading up to the song all that that was magic the dance is the first day and the dance with my dad hands down one of my favorite experience Segur I agree I could have said that but the song was great too I love it better no I love this song too and then the other thing I love the song he is here because I think that set the mood for the whole wedding day that it wasn't just about us or our families or each other but that God was the center of the whole wedding and the one that brought us together and it was just like singing the worst song if he's here like his presence is here he's abiding with us giving him the glory I think that was just a huge statement to like people they're into us that we just can live out through our family as we grow so happy first year anniversary - that's right so thanks for watching and hope you enjoyed the reminiscent of our first anniversary we will see you next week what's up my people so we're gonna say that what's up my people there we go guess what we're doing

why I'm asking if you're all right okay look at all the snacks we got so look we got like tons of drinks there's more propels than a big pack so this is bad we are going in a plane with no bathroom and we're taking all kinds of drugs take a lot of drinks I don't think we thought this through there is no portage on at 10,000 feet you will have to make one I guess we're good let's go all right we got the spinners and they're on there and they're doing that the Magneto's Magneto's will chop right that's whereabouts which all over the flaps it is radio master oh it's all master switch Oh on all of the lights beacon own have light slanting line really hear that make sure they all work nose is there it's startling oh yeah that's the gyro is spinning up yeah I thought this is gyro I thought that was like a Greek meal you eat with rice maybe you and red lights working on this end we got a red light I'm gonna go ahead and put your flaps down all right flaps coming down swaps it down inspect all right they're looking make sure all the bolts and nuts and pins there's three ways right here on 172s make sure the weights are own good in oil I like it nice and greasy flapjacks yes good they'll be my most important part of your inspection to solid 40 they'll be flapping like an awesome Samantha to church take a look at it so it looks like just got water in it it's bubbly see you separate we test all our fuel make sure make well there's no water have you ever done that in your car no never that's why airplanes are safe [ __ ] car come up here and if you stood long enough you could siphon somebody's gas out so you could siphon halt fueling vibrates handling at 700 of those and or if you just took that bolt out you could do it really quick well that's good you could go cycling you don't ever do that you know what else you can do you could just take the cap off and take a siphon hose down right that's probably smarter and easier and faster yeah well we're gonna need to see if it runs and stuff engine oil do not operate with less than four cords I knew this is where the engine was at all right all right dump me a couple quarts in there okay lid on we just got some dirt on me and stuff we've been just working on the plane alright the good hotman manly work okay everything tested out on this airplane is there worthy and ready to fight         we are here these

I just told the our vlog family what we were doing for this episode and well speaking of what I was just telling you guys she just made chocolate covered strawberries for herself she loves to snack at night so this is gonna be harder than I thought you're gonna do keto with me for 24 hours mm-hmm yep she is all right tell her no because no you wouldn't know it's eatin healthy no yeah I'll coach you through it it's gonna be great so starting I was gonna say 10 o'clock so that should give you enough time it's nine thirty seven to finish your strawberries starting at 10 o'clock for 24 hours she's gonna do keto with me okay here's the big deal so tomorrow is our pastor's wife's birthday so we were going early for choir practice anyways so she was like hey I'll get you a Starbucks she found out what Starbucks she wanted what drink and all that so she was like what will go before choir practice well she's already said it in her mind that she's getting a cake pop a birthday cake a pop come tomorrow morning she is gonna try and fight and say she can have it but if she's gonna follow through with this she cannot or else or else she fails the challenge right off the first meal she doesn't need to be but this is just fun that's why it's fun cuz she's not good at them I've never been good I'm never getting and every time when I think about doing the diet I eat twice the amount that I normally would oh I just carry on why are you trying to frame my strawberries in there I can tell that that's what you're doing she's talking about going on a diet I've never been good at diet you know my my problem is at nighttime I can do great eating normal throughout in the morning like throughout the day time and income evening well then we should probably start it at 9:39 and we'll sleep just just make these guys aren't you with me Oh put him in the fridge for after 9:30 9:00 tomorrow not gonna be good for our marriage wow she's got a grip when it comes to food all right but hang on have we got a deal 24 hours I'm not the one signing up in it come on come on this is gonna be a good one I'm already doing keto I need you for 24 hours I'm not gonna pan my body with the camera no Maya no no no so anyways 24 hours starting after you finish those at 10 o'clock deal no 24 hours for keto deal shake on it right shake on it deal 24 hours doing it for the vlog all right shake on it you saw it 24 hours she's doing keto yes break it no cuz cakepops man no you will lose the whole challenge and we will make fun of you the entire vlog but we love you I know it was a corny kiss cuz I love you but I was still mocking me hurry up enjoy the strawberries I'm gonna savor them you can savor them for 20 more minutes alright it's Sunday morning we just got up a little bit ago getting ready for church and we were about to start the first meal for Carlin's Kido day I'm excited about this because I know she's gonna get so annoyed it's just gonna be funny she's I'm probably gonna skip breakfast cuz I'm trying to do intermittent fasting so I'll probably eat after church cuz then we'll probably have to eat after church late tonight as well I'm gonna glass curtain what she wants for breakfast alright babe I'm about to make breakfast what you want he's not a big morning person but still look how cute she looks all right well you want for breakfast yes you can have eggs no toast cuz breads dad's gonna be carbs okay it's like you scream with it no bread all day no bread all day I live for brick I know babe it's hard it's a hard diet okay so for those of you that don't know keto is like it's a different type guy so you want to have 75% of your daily intake fat 20% protein and 5% carbs so it's a very low carb diet so that's why you can't have bread all kinds of different stuff now I see those three bi snick a butter in this she doesn't realize with keto its high fat so you gotta have a lot of butter sorry but can I get started for you yeah I'm gonna do a venti s'mores Frappuccino I think that'll get it all right how about we get you one I can't all right how about we get you one for you to have it - no wonder you know if I get it I'm gonna eat it right now I will save it for you I'll buy it for you if you'll save until 10:00 I want so you Devils bending me this day is just gotten worse wow you really depressed about your cake she passed up the cake pop everybody look at that face she passed up the cake pop doing it for the log all right we made it to church Karlin man those eggs were gone in a second mostly because she threw them out the window after two bites but you didn't like that had like a stick of butter I'm not even kidding I stick of butter you need to high fat with keto so you're supposed to cook yourself in a lot of butter so I did I wanted to give her the full experience and you gotta take that and give them an update I can't I'm starving I can't even think well one church went out late and then - it's my Hester's wife's birthday and so they're having like this a price thing tonight we just found out they're having like a surprise thing with cupcakes and stuff after Jeff are you kidding me this is unbelievable great day to do this challenge why is he smiling I'm starving and Evan saying we're going home to cook we're gonna probably sometime scatterers I don't have time no this is so only I've seen you make then that's when I put a lot of butter I won't put much butter in yours you're crazy I'm not lasting on this no way I'm out there has to be some type of reward for me to finish this there's no reward for me if you stick with it legit all day until 10 o'clock all right I'll give you a spa day oh and tell him about Church some little kid was giving her Mentos and she just kept popping one out through it and it was like oh I forgot Mintos hey not my fault she was dangling pink Mintos like come on this struggle was real and I didn't even think about it I told I totally forgot I was mistaken and they were three cars three grams of carbs per one and she had what three or four coming three well I think I made them for we'll say three so that's nine carbs plus you had some others the gum she's at least ten carbs that max you can do is between 40 and 60 carbs like me I'm trying to keep it like it 15 you're already a 10 so but I guess if you stay under 50 we'll say then we'll classify that you did it you guys this is the reason I don't do diets do you see what I'm doing for you guys this is a watch doing it for the log I'm holding her because she says she's so weak from this diet I am so we I'm not even kidding I'm starving guys do you realize it is 102 we're about to make some burgers so we got our hamburger here I'm about to start seasoning it we're gonna start with one burger each no no that's very bad in carbs very bad one car per teaspoon and nobody cares but we just yeah I have two frozen pizzas in my freezer look at that does that not just look delicious babe okay I literally just sit down haven't even Munya and she's halfway through before I even get the camera how is it it's actually doable yes like I think if I would have ate earlier then I would have been fine I told you really good and I put a little bit of avocado she was literally just asking me if she could quit I'm just like what's the purpose of this because my thing is I'm not gonna lose weight from it and then tomorrow or at ten o'clock tonight I'm gonna eat like five meals because me some guys said that's my problem it's a mindset yes so right now I ate that whole thing but I'm still starting some motivation well I'm just feel like hungry I think I should just quit I've done it so long I did all through the night all right here's what I'm gonna do hey you need some motivation I'm gonna call my personal trainer this guy reached out to me on Instagram he is big into keto he like works with keto brick and all kinds of stuff and trains people and he reached out to me and I took him up on it and it has literally helped me lose so much weight well he's mine hey what's up my man how's it going I'm doing good so I'm actually in the middle of a vlog we're doing where I'm getting my wife to try keto with me for 24 hours she needs some last minute words of encouragement to at least go to the club tonight but that's her challenge she wants to quit now okay constantly continuing on this journey I would have you think about don't give up what you want most for what you want in the moment there's be also you want to think about what you're why doing it for the long my why is to be healthy and fit year-round so I can perform at my best mentally and physically for my spouse for my children and most importantly for God make me start doing it now so anyways man I appreciate you giving us a call and giving her some motivation all right thanks man all right bye-bye I said giving us a call I gave him a call so does that help you at all well yeah did you do that statement yeah you had a couple good quotes in there so you're not gonna quit now right you're not gonna eat this not at this moment our pastor's wife specified parties in our cupcake it's going to be a little well done thing all right my people we are switching over to iPhone right now cuz we're in church we made it to choir practice I want to see how Karlin does with the cupcakes tonight afterwards so I want to try and keep you updated but Karlin would kill me if I brought the camera here because she'd be so embarrassed so switch over to iPhone hopefully we'll get a few clips she's doing good so far we'll see how it goes tonight we'll see how she does the cupcakes tonight is what I was telling him she says that speech really motivated from my buddy so she says she's not gonna have him tonight okay this cupcake party thing out here is getting a little harder than we thought really tempting I don't know if cartons gonna be able to hold out I barely can hold out check this out so I'm gonna try and find Carlin hopefully she hasn't snuck one of those I've been talking with some people so there's no talent there really isn't how do you snuck a cupcake yet yes so it's dark back there on Carlin and Leila she's not buckled we're not driving yet it's okay we'll get her buckled before we go we are actually heading to Waffle House with pastor and some other people because it's like we said pastor's wife's birthday Karlin passed up the cupcakes Riley because I was talking so then I forgot about yeah and then they put them all up it was great so anyways it is 9:05 right now we're going Waffle House Harlan says she thinks she's gonna have to get something so we just need to pray that her food doesn't get to the table before 10:00 if her food gets there after 10:00 she's good if it doesn't then she loses so it's her choice on what she orders as for me I can get some eggs and meat and stuff and be good but I'm eating way too late so this is bad for me but you gotta do what you gotta do so and Waffle House she did it I completed a challenge she really did I didn't think she'd stick with it okay technically she almost didn't stick with it in Waffle House we didn't film any because we were with you know our pastor and some friends from church but in Waffle House she ordered her food and knew it was gonna come past him we were eating like so she ordered regular food from 10:00 to 10:00 24 hours I told her she could do it after 10:00 so so she did get she weaseled her way around that isolate keto I mean she enjoyed it so she technically made it I guess I wore a spa day no yeah so I'm proud of you I didn't think you do it so like this video subscribe if you want to see more challenges like this one let us know what kind of challenges you want to see good challenge thanks for

maybe we'll head on home not sure if we'll show you anything from tomorrow we'll just be going to dad's Church like 7:00 call it a night for tonight and see you tomorrow all right God whoa wow that was crazy we just transported to our house yeah yeah sorry didn't give a good smooth transition on that one we woke up Sunday he was Father's Day we sang at my family's church and honestly nothing really happened after that we spend time with family just spent Father's Day with Karlin and Leila and my side of the family so it was great just some family time we needed on that note happy Father's Day to everybody out there they couldn't do it without us just kidding they probably could Carly got me this shirt it says hands off my daughter and Mateusz so that was a fun little shirt she got me thought it was cute but I give this video a like subscribe so you'll be notified of all the future videos and yeah we're going to hear so we will see you next week all right just pull this down all right all right yep okay is it looks like a wasp is stinging inside who knows what's up guys this is not a vlog I ever wanted to film so I just found out that a buddy of mine at work tested positive for covin 19 I'm already home left at lunch today I'm off for two weeks and I've got to go get tested I got an appointment it's coming up in a little bit so I just came out home and I'm gonna head back out I called Carlin and let her know but I'm gonna go see her here in a minute and we can talk about you know details and try and figure out what to do let me see if I can call her hey babe do you want to just come outside or something all right just just meet me out here I got to leave in just a little bit all right all right it looks like I'm close to her but the cameras zoomed in we've already been exposed so technically see that's what I'm worried about is if I'm positive I don't know if it does us any good to separate because you've been around me all week and I was around him earlier in the week and what if you do happen to have it and then you go stay at your family's and you you know there's a chance you're giving it to them one that live was already like had breathing things especially recently yeah she's been back she's been back doing really weird things so I just don't know like right now she's sleeping I don't know but I guess we'll know after you take your test right how long's to tell yeah it could be negative and all of this could just be because I'm supposed to go get a new car this weekend yeah we're best friends I mean of course I'm more worried about you but nobody so say so if you test positive for quarantine for two weekend we have to decide is if I'm positive do we split up I feel like if I'm positive it's best that we lock ourselves in the house and just stay hidden pray but if I'm negative then we don't have to worry about it I think I'm trying to process you know I think it's just anticipation of not knowing supposedly they said it's a rapid test where I'm going and I think they said that means it's 15 minutes and you should find out the result so we're hoping that's the case we don't have to keep waiting around cousin all honesty like no joke I'm not feeling anything like I'm not downplaying it because I know there's been a lot of people hospitalized and a lot of people even you know they've had their lives taken from this so it affects different people differently but if I do have it like I'm one of the people so far that's not feeling any symptoms give you say so Nate you don't worry I don't have well hopefully she doesn't but her voice is gone because like and they were trying to kill me on the tube they were trying to throw her off and she screamed the whole time Meriel okay all right you guys I'm here and I might ask her if I can film her doing it some people don't like that so we'll see you might not get to see that we'll see how this goes I'm actually not looking forward to it because people say it kind of hurts they say it's so uncomfortable all right so let's go ahead and get this on since I'm about to see somebody all right so the nurse is coming back in with Mike Ovid 19 tests I'm actually kind of nervous cuz some people say it actually stings or hurts or is just annoying I don't know what to expect I asked her if I could filmed it she said she'd rather not be in it but I can film you know me so hopefully you'll get to see the test flight go way up my nose might be gross I don't know now it turns out they do not have the rapid tests so this is a two to three-day test so we'll be chilling in the house for at least two days waiting to find out my results if they're negative we're good to go if they're positive we'll be in the house a lot longer than two days so anyways here we go you only lay down or stay sitting up okay I'm good like this all right just pull this down all right yep okay yeah I mean the eyes water but it's not that bad like people like like it hurt from what I heard so I'll take it all right that's all it is so we'll find out in two to three days okay she's gone that really is not that bad like my eyes are watering just because that's what happens but like I don't know I guess I've always been the kind of guy like if I'm stopped up I'll shove a little tissue up my nose or something you know what I'm saying pull it out the eyes water no they felt like that I mean people are I've had friends that were like this it was like a wasp is sting and inside who knows no so that was not that bad wasn't insanely comfortable but it wasn't that bad hopefully it's negative we'll be praying for sure already been praying that is negative it's positive Carlin's gonna kill me hmm she wanted to go see your friend we'll be stuck in the house possibility that they could have it you don't know how it would affect Leila or her so we're just really trying it's negative so bring with us I guess no by the time you see this video but still pray with us let's go to the beautiful life well I don't have any news it wasn't a rapid test it's a two to three-day test so we have to wait two to three days yeah I mean she was pretty much saying if people are already in your house and there's nothing you can do about it cuz y'all been exposed if I do have it so we're in this together if I'm positive we're here for two weeks quarantined in the house right now well start they said it's best to start now so starting right now we're quarantine for two to three days if I'm negative then you know we're good life's back to normal if I'm positive then we continue it out from two weeks from today what are we gonna do       this is very annoying to have someone crunching on an apple in your ear       I just wanted to see her no we've done about everything we can think of for today you are entertaining miss though giving you something to do we're making a vlog so today was fun so I said what's today oh well somebody doesn't like their room very much look who's coming here this morning to cuddle with mom and dad I love you and you to show everybody how you roll over hello there go boo boo daddy no way you smell it dad boom can you roll over for daddy just ignore mommy ignore the camera roll over for daddy okay go ahead daddy believes in you roll over for daddy I love you and I believe in you roll over yes yes go for it      this just in I just received the phone call for my test I'm telling you in advance like this because I didn't want to miss the call so I could barely get the camera opened and recording and stuff before I answered it so the very next clip you're gonna hear my result it's just gonna be thrown out there very quickly I'm negative well I was gonna say I haven't felt a thing so we were praying I was so I appreciate it thanks so much Baba I'm negative we don't even know what to say what to think thank you lord thank you test people oh praise the Lord all right oh I don't even know how to end it should we end it right here yeah I think we are ending it right here guys there's not next week so I think we're good to go so thanks for watching this one we are pumped and we'll see you next week do the honors Leila - she just woke up we're training her ready go are you ready I kind of did okay what's up my people we are back at my family so we've been at my family's a lot lately we got our luggage right here there's some really happy news happening and really sad news we're able to go on that trip that you heard about in our last vlog carlins going to see your best friend it's actually for a surprise baby shower so by the time these videos out like that news will be out right so that's good to know and possibly get our new car whoo but the really sad part is we've never ever left Leila before and we're actually gonna leave her with Evans mom this is our first time later yeah of course you want to take her but with everything going on like in the world with the virus spreading we've shown want to expose her to anything and we feel like it'd be best if like she actually was safe in a house not going out everywhere the airlines making us wear masks the whole time anyway so I don't really know how you do that with a baby so we just think it's safer to leave it and there's also gonna be a really long drive home so it's gonna be like twelve hours if we hit the car or more one way flight there get a car and drive back in this yeah but this is the first time I leave Leila so it is nap time she's not gonna be smiling it all she's got fall over are you gonna miss baby income I know she's in good hands so I've already got the car started and Carlin said she had to go back in to do something she hasn't been back out I think I know exactly what's going on I knew it I'm sneaking back in to say goodbye to you no no she doesn't where the wind suffered oh we do for you you don't even care moms giving out on her tuition weird leaving your child is the last time we're doing it we're actually leaving yeah this is the last time thanks for coming with us and driving back dog but I love you they'll be safe all right y'all fun we'll be back soon we just made it through security and all that safe and sound heading to our date might get a little something to eat I'll know but it's going well still missing Leila real bad right mom you know I am that's good we are boarding so this was actually a very quick flight I don't even know if you guys can hear me with this we're about to land it was only like an hour flight we got our bag and our rides here yeah heading out set alright it is very bright out here but hopefully you guys can see us look at this beauty this is what we're looking at that that's what we're looking at right there and we just found out it has automatic start from the key fob which is awesome because you can clear the car off ok well it's all just it's just yet it just have to be in the vicinity so it would just sit in your purse it doesn't have to be out all right because it was already sorry I'm just trying to figure out where everything is like a new car yeah bet you're probably not gonna need to deal with any of that I know I need to just figure it out gotcha you know okay so there's two seats yeah two seats or you can put them down yeah just go ahead and show I'm watching okay yeah you cozy up here joint alright so yeah this right here looks like gonna fall down so you've got out of this room if you need it babe we can have one two three four five more kids nope only five kids only four were kids and then this is actually two seats back here that raise up not that part the next part they look so then you pull up on the left full that it says but I didn't want to break something maybe you have to pull this yeah no alright we'll figure that out let's just drive it right with this oh wow what Oh    that's just for like yeah or you might can even put like a thing of oil back there we'll get the seats - they're all like you think oh yeah it does have automates it okay let's go all right what are your thoughts so far what are your thoughts so far this we'll all of our gas a little bit but I think it is worth it look at this windows were so my little Corolla the air doesn't work that's all right you got windows but my driver window doesn't work so if it's okay I just roll the other three down and sweat all the way home the reason we're getting a car is evidence car the other day we were driving it and I had to follow him home from work because the transmission was like stopping like he uncrate the car to pull off because it stopped like going when he hit the gas and then he cranked it back and it wouldn't go it just stopped the guy said it's probably going to transmission so you can either sell it now and tell people that or drive it till it dies so it already doesn't the windows don't work there's no air so it's summertime and Evan never complains about going to work everyday in the heat so it's time that he gets an upgrade so if you get an upgrade on the family car where we can fit back and forth go to Nashville because right now we put all our luggage in the seat Lila's car seat so we can't even put our seats back in South so we're gonna upgrade to a bigger car and Evan will take my car that it use now to go to work so I'm not just excited about this car I'm excited about having air in her little blue car that I'll get to claim and drive to work you want to mark and I'll Drive it told you I don't know much about cars don't ask me stuff in front of people oh yeah that's great

me and asked me to come back because she said she had wrecked our new car    what's up my people so carla and i are heading home from my families and we got both cars because we bought our new one and we had this little blue one that was ours that we drove down here and to begin with we're headed home and i just pulled out of the gas station when carlin called me and asked me to come back because she said she had wrecked our new car so um i came back i don't know we're gonna go see carlyn right now she's smiling at me poor girl it's not her fault it was an accident i gotta admit when i first heard i was a little annoyed because it's just like a new car we just got but you know when you think about it praise the lord her and layla are safe and it was just in the gas station parking lot that's just an accident what can you do but she's cracking me up she's looking at me right now with a big smile she doesn't know what to say hey babe it's okay i can't even look at it it's not your fault well i mean it is your fault but it's not your fault i didn't even see it i know i know let me show you what happens in my other car yeah i know it's gonna be okay just bought it not even a week ago and that's true this is like the same week we brought it home it's okay it's not your fault that's not your fault i would have done the same thing it was just an accident wearing glasses so nobody can see my teeth they it's not your fault it's just a car that's what i'm having to learn in life is you and layla being safe is the most important thing i already told them when i first heard i was a little more upset than this i'm not perfect i was like man our new car no you didn't say anything you were nice you were just like what what happened and then i just realized you know what if they're safe that's all that matters cars can be fixed but let's go look at how it happened i guess i should look at it yeah come on so as she's pulling off from the gas station they've got these little like barricades to keep people from hitting the gas tank and uh so she was pulling off and i don't even know if they can see it oh my goodness it's so bad and it kind of gave it a nice you got the green from it hey don't worry about it i'm feeling so bad i'm like hey it's an accident no worries we'll get it fixed it's not going to be a big deal an adventure to start out our trip heading back home but hey you living really embarrassing all right you guys this is embarrassing i don't even know i'm i'm putting this out there for y'all guys okay so that's fine it wouldn't happen to anybody so you live and you learn yeah it opens i already checked that well it's locked right now all right go ahead and try it yeah i mean the door's still open yeah oh yeah like bro like new guys this is really embarrassing i'm really putting myself out there no it's fine baby it wasn't your fault who wrecks the car on their like very first so of course it's moved now because like she hit it um but it was just up here normal you know and so when she went to turn she just didn't realize how close that was i think it's what i did is i pumped i pulled up the bum but i think i i was too close to the pump maybe so then when i came out i was trying to i guess i made too much of a sharp turn because i was just following you and so look it sticks out a little more than this sticks out yeah this one there wouldn't hit anything it's okay baby sorry it's all right okay well it's a good start to the trip home should we just like keep driving yeah we'll just head home call our insurance guy and get it set up to get it fixed it's all right it's all good y'all are safe that's all that matters i'm not good with cars so i honestly don't know how they'll do it but they'll fix it somehow it's not as bad as i thought though really it's worse than i thought when i thought you just bumped into something in a gas station and he didn't believe me he was like what what happened and um um it's all good no worries baby i don't think i can drive home i'm freaking yes you're driving home because this is still the safest car it's a lot safer for hurting layla than the little blue one all right we better go we'll keep you guys updated i guess when we get back and call our insurance guy and all that good stuff it's all good stop worrying about it mom's over here having like a meltdown and oh i was gonna say she's sleeping through it all but she's awake are you awake you don't even care about the car do you did you notice anything or was it still just a nice ride that's my girl i'm just glad that you're safe i love you all right let's go home let's go home let's go home all right um so it's look at who's smiling at me are you smiling at daddy are you smiling daddy what what is going on so anyways what i was going to say it's the next day we're back home we've unpacked uh just trying to get a lot done i'll be going back to work here shortly um so we're just getting everything organized around the house carlin i think she's actually doing laundry hello cutie hi yeah i'm getting old no but the laundry done getting back in the swing of things after all yeah you know how it is when you've been gone for a little while you get back you gotta get back in the swing of things like carlin is like well we're both kind of this way like we have to unpack our bag right when we get home get everything organized get the house back to normal then you can relax so yeah so we can't relax i literally i'm not even kidding i made out a list like this big late at night when we got in she always makes lists she had to get done today so we got the laundry done we picked up walmart because we're running out of diapers and there's something else we got to do today oh yeah gotta call about our car we gotta call our insurance guy the first thing i'm gonna win is about our car guys i'm sorry i like last night trying to think about it i was just like wow how how did i do that i was just so sick about it it's all good just one of y'all please tell me that you're like me and like within the first week of you getting a car you wrecked it comment below i don't think there's going to be many comments oh hey no it's fun it's fine you know you're your own person you you are unique thanks surely there's one of you that's done this right it's all good i'm just glad we called and got it on the insurance yes let me tell you a warning out there if you're going to buy a car put it on the insurance before you take it off the lot tip for you so we checked off walmart off our list we went and did that we got leila size two diapers she's growing i feel like over the last week she is so much bigger i mean she's literally almost six months like she'll be sitting up soon and then she'll be standing up then she'll be walking and she's kind of small so she is only in place yeah but she's already trying to set up though we can tell like she'll kind of if we lay her down she rolls like crazy and she's happy non-stop like she's smiling i was just showing him how she was smiling it's so cute and i just feel like i just can't keep up with everything it's just flying by way too fast anyways so i guess we should call gary get that out of the way mark another thing off of our list comment if your wife is a list person carlin literally has like eat breakfast on her list so she'll call me and she's like i've already marked like five things off my list this morning i'm like really what and she's like i've brushed my teeth i've woken up eating breakfast it's not that bad it's not but i do say i have to say breakfast on there because sometimes i skip breakfast because that's true to get the house clean and take care of layla and vacuum and yachts oh she's the hardest worker she never leaves the house the boutique because i gotta go work she never leaves the house dirty i'm only mocking that she has to put every little thing on the list that's what i'm laughing at you're a list person let me know do you love your daddy laila bug are you having play time with daddy these arm rolls guys i can't even i keep getting scared it's like i'm like her bracelet's gonna get too small and then i'm like but i can still stick a finger in it but the fat rolls make it look like it's like owner so tight so we've kind of like settled down we've finished doing a whole bunch of projects um and we are gonna make the call to our insurance guy and see what we can do about the car this is my blushing red face stop baby it's fine it was an accident i'd have probably done the same thing it's not embarrassing should we pull the curtain now you can see us better hello carla hey gary how are you feeling good are you back in town i am and i have some really really embarrassing and sad news that i needed to ask you about okay i go you know our new car we just bought well i wrecked it on the way home you ripped it well here's what happened did you do that i okay i'm not used to driving a big car yet and so i was following evan home and we went and stopped at a gas station to get gas well we went to pull out and i must have like cut it too tight and it hit one of those like metal post things that are there to protect the gas pumps and i hid it on the side so like the the side door back door got smashed in okay so what is our deductible to like have to pay to get it fixed with the insurance 500 oh i'm gonna throw up i just did it yesterday it's a fresh scrape isn't it i know it does sad please tell me have you heard of other people doing this before literally after the week they buy their car oh yeah well not that quick but i've had people do that that's pretty pretty common all right well thank you gary all right we appreciate it love you bye okay funny story the guy that is our insurance man his son actually owns the place that we're renting from and so he's like our landlord and he's always taking care of checking everything out not to mention they've been family friends with them forever so they're almost like their grandparents yeah that's why she said love you bye she doesn't just say that to her i don't i promise yeah so he's a good close friend of the families for like ever anyway well you know we'll keep you guys updated but for now we'll see you later getting a little embarrassed what's up we are officially in our rental car it's pretty nice still wish we had our car even though this one is newer but i don't know we've fallen in love with our car like very quickly it was love at first drive so i guess this is what we'll be uh sporting for the next week or two while ours gets fixed yeah she's smiling every time we talk about it she can't help but like smile i don't know i just still can't believe it happened but i mean no worries at least we have a story to look back on until like i'm the one and only that wrecked their car in the first week but that's okay not true my second time driving it and i wrecked it that actually sounds worse just say that it was the first week don't say it was only the second time driving it i mean all in all i feel like wrecking your car is like so small in perspective to like everything that's going on right now in the world so i think it's more about just perspective and i'm just thankful that everything's good like yeah it might be a little hiccup but at least we still have each other and life is good so i just wanted to throw that little bite in there whatever you're going through right now god knows he got this and just looked at him in all your hiccups in life all right we're gonna head out we're gonna end this one right here so thanks for watching subscribe if you're not subscribed turn on the notification bell so you can see when we post new videos and like this video um give it a thumbs up yeah let's see we're gonna see you next week uh i just got off the phone with the pediatrician i called them just to see should i ask to talk to a nurse should i bring her in should we not like is it just overreacting because our first time we do that a lot because we're first time parents    what's up my people welcome back happy saturday uh we're coming at you live no we're not this is recorded it's youtube i just hear people say that all the time on tv we are actually considering taking layla to the pediatrician carlin's got her over here look at this sad little face she has not been feeling good she did not sleep like at all last night i just kept having to get her up and like suck her nose out and then she was uh running a fever this morning so i'm just kind of like i don't know like should we take her in should i not and then she's also had like different breathing issues where she'd look like she's struggled breathing um so we just had some concerns and caution she's falling asleep babe she just fell asleep when i was talking poor thing she did not sleep good last night so she's been holding on to me all day long she won't let me put her down so she's been fussy so um i just got off the phone with the pediatrician i called them just to see should i ask to talk to a nurse should i bring her in should we not like is it just overreacting because her first time we do that a lot because we're first time they just said anytime like she's still five months and just young like we should just take her in just in case just to be safe than sorry i don't know being a parent is like scary like you just want to make sure you do everything right and you're careful it's a huge responsibility to be parents so we just want to make sure that we're taking the best care of her as we can well especially with her breathing because if you've seen some of our older videos she's had some serious situations honestly with her breathing and stuff i mean of course every time something happened we didn't like grab the camera and be like hey let's update our vlog family just because it's kind of serious there was all kinds of times that stuff happened and it was very scary and it still is to this day she's got her hole in her heart and so you just you never know what could happen because of that yeah and not just that she's really really bad acid reflux um so she had like acid reflux episodes so of course she worries us i think every first-time parent that was worried too and even having more kids than that is just i think everything's new for us so we're not sure like are we being too cautious are we freaking out too much should we not and then she's got this new thing um yeah i explain it as like when you're trying to get a kid to stop crying and they're like that's kind of what she's doing i think carlin actually filmed a clip the other day so i'll probably throw that up there so you guys can check it out and to be honest like i don't even know what it is i've heard some people say all right she looks like she's struggling to breathe other times they're like well maybe she just started having like scary dreams early so we just kind of just want to run all that by and which her song that she has in person has really been accurate like we feel it's really helped ease our mind and any time she's done this type of a thing it's never gone off so i don't know if she is having scary dreams or something so they're pretty scary i guess so whenever it happens i normally just try and like wake her up and shake her and i'll hold her and say it's okay um and she'll normally calm down after that so i don't know we just kind of been calling on the phone trying to figure out what's happening but we haven't taken her in just because of covid um but when i called today they said you know what you should just probably um bring her in because i just talked to the pediatrician so they got her appointment literally in like 15 minutes so but she was definitely super stopped up today like so bad right and it may just be a calm and cold like every time she yeah because she's coughed a little and every time she coughs it's like green just and actually she literally like never spits up i think maybe her whole life i think that sounds funny she's six months old but her whole life i think she's only spit up like what once or twice yeah yesterday she actually spit up all down my shirt that was my first time to get spit up on that's how good she's been in like almost six months he wants to document her like first second spit up i should have i should have filmed it for you guys but no so that kind of makes me think maybe she's you know got a stomach pug or something i don't know we're about to head out and we'll keep you guys updated as we go love you guys you didn't see that hang on carlin said go back turn it on i want to say something else any of you are like in the medical field or like have ever experienced something like this leave me a comment below just i don't know for peace of mind or if i'm just overreacting maybe like the video that he shot up there on the screen was like nothing but um i don't know it just it all kind of just worries me you're saying if it is something maybe they'll know yeah maybe one of you will know because i'm sure like with all the experiences in the world someone has dealt with it if we haven't told you before i'm being sarcastic we say it all the time we're first time parents so we don't know what's going on half the time anyways all right that's what i wanted to say all right now we go we just made it to the doctor's office it's uh sprinkling a little bit so we're gonna try and get layla in quick and uh we'll see if we can get any footage inside for you    you don't feel good do you baby look at that sad face you can tell you got your mask so we're getting yeah    hey in hi dad got mommy's hair i said 14 you said 15. 14 pounds 5.2 ounces yup i'm closer oh my goodness you're right daddy wins are you so big who's just looking over here at me still smiling even when they don't feel good dad won the um wait challenge as you saw we switched over to iphone see i feel better now you look you're acting my head she is acting a little better now she's not running an attempt carlin said she was running a tent this morning does she say it could be multiple things um like a cold or just weather changing yeah but to keep a close eye on her yeah keep checking her tent and stuff next week anyways so we'll bring her back and he's okay but are you doing good for now are you doing better she's smiling a little bit yeah she wasn't earlier all right we're heading out i'm okay yeah you feeling better well i'm glad we did it yeah we kind of figured they wouldn't have much to say but we didn't know if they'd suggest anything we're versatile appearance we don't know so that's true it was worth it all right ladies and gentlemen we got something to show you this is an exciting day just arrived yep that's part of it that's how it's supposed to be so they took a lot longer than they thought they were originally going to take so they ended up dropping it off for us so we didn't even have to pick it up so that made our life even easier so rental car is gone this car's back i mean like the rental car was technically a newer nicer car but i don't know i just loved this thing cheers let's go what do you think layla you happy your car's back okay so recently she's been like obsessed with the grass anytime i put her in the grass she loves it so look at her she's just like staring at the grass there you go now you're touching it you're getting so strong well daddy will just join you in the grass too and we will say goodbye turn on your post notifications so you know that we're here look at her like it that's the thumbs up button over there or maybe over there and what's the last thing um i thought she was gonna go three for three subscribe there she goes she's getting smart say and we'll see you saturday see you next week oh    all right we on here what's up my people carlin is actually out shopping with her sister and her mom right now and today is laylah's sixth month birthday and i know you're gonna be like you're stupid that's not her birthday but she's my first child okay so i want to spoil her nothing fancy maybe a stuffed animal or bring

then being sweet to the wife so this is it's gonna be good i think i'm gonna head out to walmart while they're shopping and just see what i can find something little but she's six months old today

you i understand pass that one up i think i got everything let's cancel the dryer don't want to start a house fire while we're gone now do we no we do not oh i almost left my keys inside that would have been bad because see i always lock the door handle first i would have locked myself out i've done that before like i said carlin's not here so i'm i mean i'm alone i had to get myself ready today it's just been hard all right probably won't film while i'm driving so you guys can't yell at me so i'll see you at walmart all right here we are at walmart um probably gonna take the iphone in because it's just less awkward to be seen filming with an iphone than a camera no offense buddy no offense hey you're a good camera okay you do a lot of stuff for us you work hard okay the iphone's just better in this situation okay it's not you it's me okay sorry anyways we're gonna head on in okay so i made it to the flowers um they just got you know cheap little sets of flowers i guess bouquets is what they're called so i don't really know what to get i don't know if you get a six month old uh probably get some for carlin while i'm at it but just trying to think ahead i think i think that'd be good for me i think i think all guys should do that every once in a while so we got some just like roses and then like a mixture so i don't know i may go for roses for layla just as kind of sweet like father daughter but i don't know at six months i guess she won't care uh so i don't really know i'll just grab a couple of these and bounce out i guess i don't really know what else to get or uh i don't know like a stuffed animal maybe i'm not really seeing anything for a six month old i don't think they make cards for that either i think i need a little stuffed animal or something i don't know guys this is harder than i thought look so i found these like some small stuffed animals i almost think one of those is just gonna have to be good i mean it's just six month old i'm not trying to spoil her i just wanted to be sweet maybe a unicorn or something i don't know i'll show you guys at the end i guess all right i'm back home turns out carlin did get home but she went down the road to help her sister michaela with something so she's not here so this is perfect i can get inside real quick hopefully she'll be home soon hey babe can you come here real quick no it's nothing like that now you're making it weird i just got you flowers because you are the best mommy and the best wife ever but not gonna lie it was mainly about layla um it's her six month birthday so i got her a little something i had the sweetest husband ever i didn't know if i should get a six month old those type hours or roses but i just wanted this is that not the sweetest thing in the world wow so i know what it is so you can't give layla something without giving me something well i explained it to them i said it's double it's two for the price of one why not take all the brownies and then i got her this oh my god i got you little minnie mouse minnie mouse i've been thinking now i never watched the show oh my gosh    we're chilling my house is a wreck don't judge and ally they've all been out shopping i love you she's like i don't know what to think she's really tired yeah did you see your flowers look roses whoa don't show the price roses i can't they're pretty cheap at

subscribed and we will see you next week ay we're going to check me out again oh my goodness    so    what's up my people today actually starts back my first day of school a lot of you might not know what i do i'm in an electrician apprenticeship program so i'm going into my fourth year it's a five year program so i got this year and then next year and then i'll be topped out lord willing as long as i pass each year carlin's actually not home right now so i'm about to head off to class you know i get asked a lot what i do so you can kind of see that and then we'll get on with the rest of the vlog so so i made it to school there's been like a whole group of you know rough tough construction electricians right next to me talking for several minutes so i waited um because i don't know i feel like they'd probably make fun of me for holding a camera and filming myself in the car uh that's not a good way to start out your uh year at school anyways so i started school in nashville doing the same thing and i got married and moved here so i was able to transfer to this school of course you know get the mask they're doing a lot of it online i hear it's going to be a lot harder this year just because of all the changes they're making so honestly guys pray for me uh really need a pass this year it's going to be rough doing it online teaching yourself a lot of it's gonna be hard so keep me in your prayers i'd appreciate it it's uh there's a lot of and so if you uh cut the wood and you build we can build a boat i'm working on building the boat right now rough tough manly stuff sorry some electricians are passing the car and i wouldn't i don't look like a pretty boy filming myself in the car so i got to sound manly anyways better hit it up i better get in there here we go oh all right guys um yeah i couldn't show you anything in the class sorry it's just too awkward everybody's sitting there trying to learn mainly they just went over stuff how it's going to be this year with covid and everything you know they're making a lot of adjustments this year we're supposed to be learning a lot about motor controls we're supposed to have a lot of hands-on work in the class they're trying to figure out how we can do that and still stay six foot apart and it's honestly going to be crazy they said it's going to be honestly a lot harder of a year so i don't have that to look forward to but oh well if we can hunger down we can get through this and then just one more year after this then be done    but anyways that's all i got for you guys tonight so uh on with the vlog okay guys so a little update and her little girls are still in town yesterday leila had a really rough day she was like nothing like i've ever seen she was like squealing we thought it was teething we gave her like tylenol for the first time she woke up today and she has like i'll show you this rash she has on her i might have evan throw some photos up there if you can see it better so i don't know like what it is it was like super bright red earlier and then she has it on both sides and she has little marks here so so i'm gonna just call the pediatrician see what they think like every vlog nowadays are like something poorly going through like crazy things i don't know i hope you first time parents have had some of these same things i don't know not that i wish it on your kid i just wish like someone tell us we're in the same boat because it's like i'm calling the pediatrician like every other day okay guys it is the next morning we didn't take her in yesterday because we just they weren't sure if we should because the rash went away but then this morning it is come back and everything so i put her in the bed with me just to watch her till we can get to an appointment i look like a mess too it's so early my best guess is she's allergic to something but i just don't know what i keep you posting all right guys so got ready in like 10-15 minutes evan's not here so i switched to iphone um just to keep you guys updated i feel like i've gone to the pediatrician every week this is crazy and pretty much they say nothing but i'm like i want to be that parent that like something is wrong and then something happens just because we keep crying wolf although there's always been something that's wrong there's just nothing they can do for it so anyways maybe we'll figure out what it is i took the first available appointment for about 10 minutes out so we just made it look at the cute little layla back there he's been playing with her feet the whole time when i left the house her rash was gone so it's only lasting a little bit which is kind of weird i don't know how brushes work but anyways she seems happy now tell everybody hi say we're going to check me out again oh my goodness yeah yeah we're going to check your vitals aren't we going to love my feet mom i love my feet mom she didn't think that it was like a reaction to food or something that she um ate but she thinks it is oh genetic something like in the air that she's getting so she's gonna put her on some medicine and see if she doesn't break up tomorrow ah are you talking to them all right we are back in the car and basically she said it's not something that she's eating or drinking she doesn't think she thinks it's something that's like basically like in the air um so that's what she thinks she's getting it from so she prescribed her um two weeks of medicine and see if it gets better because this is the second day in a row that she's broke out in hives and also she said it was hives so yeah let's get this girl better what's up my people we're eating our last bit of mcdonald's because we're so healthy yeah we're really trying to watch the carbs i've been telling where we're going we're going to play spike ball i'm like a kid my mom's letting me go play with the friends next door he's so funny down the street from us they have like this tennis courts and they have lights and stuff so the boys have been playing there at night and so it's been like the thing to do the last two days layla has not broke out in hives so hopefully the medicine that they gave her um has been working so gay for us and my sister and her girls are gone so layla's doing good it's just kind of back to normal it's back to normal we're gonna have a little bit of a chill night and party it up i always regret this though like i have fun doing it and i guess i am getting older because i'm like i'm gonna go play ball tonight then afterwards i come home two things i can regret i normally say carlin i didn't play basketball good and it was totally a waste of a night i barely made any points and i just ruined the team i was on that's what i normally say secondly i'm just tired and sore and wish i hadn't done it wish i would have slept or chilled with the family so anyways we're gonna go do that you guys having fun all right we out here spike balling it up look at this cutie are you having fun she loves me outside she's getting so strong now she's like standing up on her own yeah she's starting to move and she likes it you out here playing me and t-ray isaiah some good competition out here getting a little exercise oh yeah what a sir       where the what do you call us the cheerleaders on the sidelines well that was a fun night uh we're already back home i'm showered and changed carlin's laying down and i'm just gonna go ahead and end it right here by myself sorry you don't get the cute girl and the cute baby this time it's just cute dad just kidding so anyways hope you liked the video you can click right there i think for uh last week's video and right there for like a youtube recommended video go watch those and uh thanks for always being right there to watch our videos you know you guys are awesome so we'll see you next week yeah so carlin tested positive we've got her in a different house right now i'm gonna get tested we're gonna have to test layla and we just don't know we don't know what to do this is literally just so much    what's up my people i am going back for the second time to be tested for covet 19. carlin has an interesting story that she needs to tell you guys so let's throw it over to her real quick and then we'll get back to me okay guys i'm on my phone evan said that i had to get on here and update y'all kind of what's going on um anyways a few days ago um i started getting a headache and my eyes started burning and i felt like i had a low grade fever and at first i kind of just thought oh it's maybe because i have not slept and i haven't drank a bunch of water and normally they say that's the cause for a headache um anyways so i separated from evan and then ended up getting tested and i tested positive for kobe 19 which was just peachy because they're saying i need to quarantine um everyone for so many days 10 days after my tests or symptoms showed up i don't know i feel like they're changing it every day um every day's been like a roller coaster it's been up and down um i pretty much have all the symptoms right now um i can't taste anything i can't smell i have a headache fever super weak my neck feels like it's bruised like my back and everything it's the weirdest villain ever anyways i know i look like death don't judge but there's a little update for my side i miss my baby so much and i've been crying every day since i've left i'm not even kidding it's so sad so i'm just trying to figure out how we're gonna play this what we're gonna do we'll see what happens yeah so carlin tested positive we've got her in a different house right now i'm gonna get tested we're gonna have to test layla and we just don't know we don't know what to do this is literally just so much oh no just pray with us guys this is uh it's getting to be a lot i don't know we'll try and keep you posted okay guys um i just went back there and tested they had me come around the back of the building they said i should know in 15 to 20 minutes we were able to find a rapid test this time so i'm just sitting in the car waiting it's literally like waiting to know if you pass some big exam at school or something like that's how i feel right now i'm like nervous okay they're calling um do you need a copy of these results today sir or anything for work i probably will for work yeah all right appreciate it thank you all right bye-bye oh my goodness this is bad carla and i both are positive for coven 19. this is a bunch of junk so here we go two weeks at home again all right guys uh it's been a crazy day so far it's only 10 a.m so let me give you a quick rundown to recap all of that that's happened carlin started feeling symptoms of just a sickness she wasn't even thinking cobit at the time it wasn't all the in-depth symptoms that a lot of people go through it's just kind of a sickness but she actually got out of the house she was staying in another house where she could kind of be quarantined and more isolated we dropped layla off with my family in nashville so we've all three been separated this last week as her symptoms progressed she decided to go get tested and she was positive which then started making us think what about me what about layla so i went and got tested now i'm positive i'm not feeling anything so my plan was that i'd lord willing be negative and i was gonna come visit layla at my families um here in nashville because i missed her like crazy it's been like all week that we've all three been separated and i brought them some milk from our freezer that carlin had pumped so i was going to come here and spend some time with them and layla so we didn't know what to do i mean don't judge us for any of our decisions guys we're making this up as we go this is this is a big thing to go through only being married a year and having a kid and then going through all this and trying to figure out what the best decision is so she stayed separated i was going to come visit layla that was all the plan before we even knew you know she was positive but then she tested positive so i figured i should get tested and now that i've tested positive my family is going to take layla in the morning to get her tested so if she's positive then we might as well just all three go back home me carl and layla will all be together positive in the same household if she's negative we don't really know what to do so here is our plan so far but carlin might be coming here to nashville and us maybe i guess camping outside staying away from my family far away um because they're going to test layla in the morning and then we could kind of make our decision do we all travel back together do we still leave layla here for like a long time for like two weeks we'd go crazy i miss her so much already it's already been almost a week or do we take her back with us or i don't know so right now what we do know is i'm literally sitting outside my family's house not going inside i just showed up because i figured i should wait till in the morning to see what layla tests i just got back from testing at that place and they're taking layla to test in the morning so she'd get back about this time so i'm here my family's outside bored to death by myself for the next 24 hours i mean what do you do for 24 hours by yourself    so       all right guys little update still outside i had brought some old milk that carlin had pumped so that my family could have it that was when i was planning on staying the weekend and then going back to work and leaving layla because carlin was gonna stay stay that house until her time was up being positive my sister ashley's over here she's gloved up and got the lysol to spray down the bag and the milk bags it's like i'm in jail it's like yeah this umbrella is like eight feet they've got it taken down because it was storming so that's proof it's like i'm in jail like they're having to do stuff and i'm just sitting back in my little cage i can't wait till supper time see what they throw me i guess so well would you look at this they're bringing me some food and some drink and all that    thanks i guess that's how you get lunch when you uh get covered okay so it's now been like six hours um starting to get really bored look who i picked up hey people we can hold hands now because we're both coveted don't make me mad we're the co-vig couple well i sound like a man just glad i'm back with evan i know i'm so excited my head hurts my throat hurts my body hurts i'm very stopped up but i have this thing is like a nebulizer so i've been doing treatments which has helped so much i love you i'm fine what are you doing you want mommy does that make it better or worse a little better it's mommy's hair are you trying to get mommy oh come here don't say come here you're gonna tease her he loves you oh are you trying to get mommy that's so cute i think this is making it harder on us it's about time for us to go hunker into our uh car or our bed i don't know what you want to go away you're not having fun no it's not right this is so annoying so annoying i love you bug brushing your teeth this is insane how was that a scale of one to ten how easy simple smooth was getting ready for bed with a water hose well we took a bath in the pool and then we came up here you comfy no really all right y'all we're about to turn in normally we'd be in a big comfy bed inside running water in a sink that'd be nice be real nice i wish i could bring layla over here i don't know cove it stinks we could just leave in the car well i guess we'll give you an update in the morning let you know how the night went good night that didn't get as dark as i thought i thought it was going to just like end it like a dark screen good night how'd you sleep a lot has happened since last night because some of evan's family went to get tested along with layla so layla was technically negative um so that's definitely good the only problem is uh one of my sisters tested positive so all of them didn't get tested the other sisters yeah there were some other symptoms so there's some other sisters that have the same symptoms as hers but they haven't gone and gotten tested yet so so we're kind of trying to consider we've talked to doctors that said it normally they don't think would be a big deal for layla to be with us because it doesn't affect kids as much and her nursing would actually be good to get some more antibodies and stuff so i think we've made the decision if we left her here she's around people that are positive anyways now so we might as well take her home her to be with her parents in nursing so we're just going to pray we're going to try and stay out of her face i know we're parents doing everything for us so that's kind of hard to do but we're going to try our best but it's our only option at this point we've packed up and we're gonna head home and let the quarantine begin i did not feel that way yeah it's really still hitting carlin pretty hard she had some blurry vision earlier and was starting to get dizzy so i don't know keep you posted well hello did somebody miss mommy and daddy this last week well we made it home did we make it we all fell asleep when we got home because we feel so tired so uh looks like it's gonna just be us three amigos for the next couple weeks what do you have to say about that leila you're happy to be back with mom and dad   guys look at the fat rolls like what in the world all right so we're gonna get out of here you uh saw all the uh i don't know craziness we've been through both being positive yeah it was crazy wasn't it yeah she said yeah so i don't know it's just been a lot but now it looks like we'll be in the house for a couple weeks and we'll try and i don't know show you that that's gonna be boring probably so we'll keep you updated the next couple weeks but as of now i think that's all right layla you got anything else to add hey thanks for watching we'll see oh oh oh don't cry say thanks for watching and we'll see you next week we found this again here in the bedroom this is where we've been living our life for the past week with our breathing treatments and all that good stuff i actually have a massive headache today    what's up my people part two of us with kovid honestly this week we're still in the house we're still fighting it we're still quarantined so it'll just be you know following us around seeing how everybody's doing got carlyn and layla over here she's doing her trick over and over she has started to crawl and it's so funny because she gets up on all fours and then she like lunges yeah she's trying to lunge like she's like bulldozing mom you little girl what are you doing you found this again here in the bedroom this is where we've been living our life in the past week with our breathing treatments and all that good stuff i actually have a massive headache today it like stinks but layla is happy she's doing fine aren't you face plant push up then plop ready oh did you give up okay there you go there you go    a ton of people were asking in our last vlog about like symptoms and stuff we knew like when we knew we had it or whatever i kept thinking it was because i didn't drink enough water and like i was staying up late and so i was tired so i was like i'll just sleep it off but then i like slept till two o'clock in the day and i was like what's wrong with me and i have like a massive headache fever my eyes were like super they felt like sinuses almost behind your eyes like headaches some those were some of the first symptoms and then now of course you can't smell can't you're super soft up you can't taste anything it's ridiculous why am i even eating and funny i was feeling better yesterday i thought and then today i'm back feeling like back in the first parts of this which is weird so i don't know what's up with that my head's pretty pounding right now i can still taste so that's good i'm still enjoying food i don't have near as many symptoms as she does i pretty much have all the symptoms besides um i haven't had a lot of trouble breathing because i've been doing the breathing treatment thing whatever that they say is supposed to help open you up so every time i take it it like opens my chest up so it's just like laying here looking i'm truly just so thankful that we don't have it as bad as most people like oh man our prayers go out to you guys there's been a lot of people hospitalized we haven't had to go to the hospital we've been home it's just not been like fun it's not something fun to go through well yeah i mean carlin has had it pretty rough she didn't feel too great i mean but not to the extent that a lot of people have had it no way like i'm so thankful like it's definitely made us more aware of code 19 and putting us in other people's shoes honestly and taking a lot of precautions because wear your masks people yes just know if you're in this situation right now i've got a lot of like messages and dms saying we've contracted the virus and we're praying for you guys we really are we know it's tough and i want you to know that we're saying a prayer for you we hope that you guys are recovering we'll see how this plays out we're supposed to be on the tail end right now we're just trying to play it by ear i'm sure we're probably going to be stuck in at home like longer than we thought just to play it safe because one we don't want to spread it to anybody and so that's like the biggest thing but we'll keep you guys posted with our recovery and whatnot you'll just be following us around the house i guess in this vlog we made this huge meal last night taco salad it's one of my favorites she couldn't taste the thing i was so mad and i actually put like too hot yeah she did it because i was like i want to she said i can feel that it's kind of hot but i can't taste anything yeah i couldn't taste the thing my mouth would just burn she going add it is it yummy see who loves the little peter i'm so cute our dishes are piling up from supper good at keeping it clean as i go but this one's been rough uh our pan's too small we're spilling over over here um all this stuff is actually more organized than you think this is actually our meals for the rest of the week i went through the cabinet and thought hey what can we throw together so we got a little chicken feta cheney coming your way just gotta get some chicken little pancakes for dinner one night uh and tonight's you can see spaghetti and meat sauce with some garlic bread it just tastes really hot in my mouth yeah i went ahead and made it extra spicy because she can't taste this time and i like stuffed spicy so it's pretty lame that we did not even show y'all eating because we were so hungry that we ate the whole thing anyways we're cleaning up and i have a chill afternoon layla fell asleep in her swing and now she woke up hi sweet girl did you have a good nap my mom and daddy ate a good nap oh you're so sweet hello what are you doing you trying to crawl you're not getting off this bed you're not getting off this bed daddy's not gonna

marriage this was a knock-down dragon it wasn't that bad but it was like i don't know he's basically ruining my living room and i'm okay with that no i'm not obviously you are because you ordered everything    hey what's up my people we're gonna jump right into it today like i've said before we're like two weeks past being free of quarantine um but we're just trying our best not to go many places anywhere we really don't need to just trying to stay at home for the most part however um i don't know if it was just being cooped up in the house or what it was that got her wanting to do this but carlin has made some drastic changes she had a hair appointment so she did go to that you guys have got to see this guess what guys today is the day i'm actually getting my hair done i've not gotten my hair done since layla was born and it's like insane anyways i'm not sure what i'm going to do yet but mostly i was talking to evan last night i was like uh should i get it like one of those cuts where like it angles down but like a longer version like past my shoulders or should i go blonde with it or should i go darker or should i keep it long so we'll see what happens here's a little before so y'all can see it's pretty long see what happens next all right so carlin tells me she's walking out and i should film my response because i don't know what she did to her hair i kind of want to turn around and see her but maybe i'll wait till you guys can kind of see with me okay i see her feet i have not seen her hair yet but i see her feet okay i gotta get his reaction i think i'm gonna let her come up like this and me not even look yet oh she's coming to my side whoa i like it what do you think i like it do you love it or what i really do is see the bomb.com okay i really do love it i think you are what are you doing be honest no i'm dead serious i love it i seriously love it   i love it she's done blonde before and i don't know i really like blonde on her i like either on her blonde and brown but when she does like the kind of blondish brown mixty mix i really do like it and this length i love it i really do all right guys she's right next to me get ready oh wait they've already seen wait they've already seen it but you saw the reveal on the last clip okay gotcha i was having my mindset this was like a big reveal oh well all right so here we go i love it did something different i don't know if it was just being cooped up in quarantine um yeah but shout out to her appointment was like just do whatever you want so i didn't even know what she was gonna do i was like i just kind of want to look different because i'm just like done and so she turned my chair so i wasn't in the mirror seeing it or anything and then i turned around like what what did you think of mommy's hair did you like mommy's hair when she has something like in her hands or something she's going for she is zoned in determination is strong water spout i think this looks amazing i love it so that's it for this segment on with the rest of the vlog happy birthday to you happy birthday to you thanks babe happy birthday baby thank you i love you so i just wanted to say uh since it's your birthday where would you like to spend it we can spend it in layla's room or the kitchen i was gonna say we're trying not to go anywhere what do you mean yeah that's about all we can do we'll start out in the kitchen then we can go to the living room maybe watch some tv uh then go to layla's room and organize some clothes or something else what else do you do guys i don't know so it's evan's birthday today i'm so excited about this so he is the grand total of 25 yeah big things happening i can rent cars insurance we'll probably go down the rbos yeah makes life a lot easier we're big now well wow i'm getting excited about being able to rent a car i am getting old okay so evan's birthday present this was a little bit of an argument not gonna lie guys i had to really yeah i'll set you right there so we can oh that's smart and first of all um i'm glad you didn't finish the whole song because being sung happy birthday to is probably the most awkward thing in anyone's life so i like that it's not like awkward so this was actually yes a marriage argument we had over his birthday because evan big time wants like a desk because like a little office but our house is so small and i'm like i'm fine with you getting a desk just get something that matches because we're like we can do one like maybe in the liver living room like behind the door or whatever everyone has a different style than me it's very cute and stuff and she likes more of like this whatever they call it modern mid-century modern decorations or bow hunting well my living room is more like has a little more farmhouse and stuff but my bedroom in layla's room is kind of like the style like see so it's all already kind of a little different so i'm just bringing in another layer another category basically i just said order whatever you want yep because it's my birthday present from her so she was excited give that to ryan on there yeah sure so he's setting up a huge like office corner vlogs you guys that's his hobby so i'll be editing for you guys i'm editing for our church a lot now yeah um and it just breaks your body bending over on the coffee table from the couch like this so i was just like please can we look at something so she hooked me up with like a monitor a desk i can't wait to show you guys he's dying to set it up so this stuff arrives i'll show you i'll show you where our plan is to put it too because it's the only place in the house so one thing arrived his chair the chair has already arrived it completely doesn't match my house it's gonna be black black rolling chair office chair i'm like why can't it be something that goes with like this beautiful room yeah she wanted me to use this one yeah and i was like here's the thing here's the thing you don't this is not an office chair that doesn't have arms and it doesn't roll you gotta be able to scoot yeah so is what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this we're gonna get rid of it get rid of it get rid of the lamp i guess i don't know maybe emma can stay i doubt it his desk is huge she let me get a big one no i didn't take up the whole time i just said do whatever you want but you said the other stuff's here yeah i think this so basically this only means that our vlogs should be getting better right they um not particularly this just means it's gonna make it easier on me to do them he's cute so what's your last thing we're waiting on the desks should be in tomorrow so when he gets kind of the main piece desk in yeah you can't really set it up without a zest so when it comes in we will of course update you we'll see if i even remember to include you guys you may just see the finished product that's okay all right so i guess you'll see they care i think they care very much oh yeah they're dying to see how beautiful my living room becomes we'll see you guys in a bit guys check this out uh am i wearing the same thing i was yesterday that's what happens on quarantine it is another day there it is

it says mama's bestie says the truth are you mommy's bestie she's really daddy's but i was like mommy could use the encouragement so let's get that outfit all right babe yeah even no you cannot tell me that that does not look okay it's not that it doesn't look good it looks fine and it looks very neat and everything looks like put together but it's just the fact that i had this huge tv thing our house is already small i have two couches coffee table all the corners are full so it just like clutters it up a little but it's not that it looks that but it looks great it's actually the perfect spot for it really it looks great how hard was it to say that a little bit all right now you guys get the reveal here we go should i be sitting at the desk sure hello what are you doing i'm getting

our neighborhood that we were gonna go to but then on our way back from mcdonald's we thought hey we should show you some land that we're looking at this is just like things that we've been looking at

let's go look what daddy got you i got you some toys and a blanket actually there's lots of memories here because if you see that little building over there that's where we found out we were expecting a girl that's so true every time she gets outside she is very alert that's actually so true it takes her about 30 minutes to get used to it and then she has she's such an adventurous soul all right somebody's trying out the swing she actually thinks it's pretty cool she has no facial expression oh she never does it's happening when she's trying something new she's just in the zone she doesn't really have anything to figure out what's happening i look for baby swing but they don't have a baby from here say you want to go on the slide sit down oh she doesn't get it yet uh she's wanting to hold on you want daddy to go down with you go with daddy one time down the slide here we go did you know that she probably shouldn't be playing with that stuff she can this is like she doesn't put it in her mouth all right then hey she likes that stuff more than her toy so entice her with that stuff we're gonna see if we can get her to do her little uh crawl for you guys come get it come here come on come here come on you're almost there and fall forward she won't do her knees and then her arms will go forward she don't fall we're going to be mean parents we're going to keep moving it as you

gonna get her to bed take a little nap like i said subscribe like this video and we'll see you next week what's up my people so we're out here chilling um at probably one of our favorite places in the knoxville area it's actually where we officially became like boyfriend girlfriend i'll show you    we're sitting in the back of the car because this year we try to start like listening to audiobooks listening because we're not huge but yeah that's so true so it's been kind of like one of our goals this year is to listen to one and we just well we're almost done reading this one called the five love languages it's been so it really has been i'm not even kidding and so we're like hey we should pop on here and tell them about it so that's what we've been doing so we're sitting in our pretty spot i feel like car dates have been our thing carlin is a sucker for car dates and it's worked out well because with covid and everything you know you don't get to go to a ton of places so it's been i don't know there's something about the vibe it's just romantic and sweet so it's kind of like a picnic but without the food we're just kind of chilling right now yeah we do all kinds of car dates we eat in the car we sit in the back in the trunk and layla has the perfect spot to play with her toys and we pick pretty places and then we also like go just driving around looking at houses because that's what we've been used to lately anyways i say all of that to say we're gonna let them in on our little uh yeah let's let them in on our challenge deals we've been doing this year you tell them okay so we don't do this every week so don't think we've got it all together since the start of the year we've tried to like at least every single month yeah we will pick something um we'll kind of talk with each other and we'll say different things we think the other one could work on to help just you know help our marriage help our lives maybe things that would make us feel more loved or whatnot so this book is really kind of taking that a step further for us because it's talking about you know the five love languages if you don't know what the five love language is basically it talks about saying the different ones are like words of affirmation quality time access service touch and i can't remember number five we don't remember the fifth one so neither one of us must have that one because we only remember the ones that apply to us i guess so read the book that's your little secret go find out the fifth one um carlin says she's like all of them i'm at least three of them so i haven't fully decided i'm either quality time words of affirmation or touch yeah i go back and forth which one i am but evan is definitely i'm definitely yeah i love to feel encouraged from her our marriage is not perfect a lot of times like when you watch youtube it's like oh 10 minutes or instagram and little squares you see we've only been married like a little over a year and of course we still have problems we still have arguments and we have to work through that and that's one of the things we want to let you guys know like we're not perfect we're normal just like everybody else and there's always things we can work on and if there's any way we can help you guys work on it as well then that's awesome we're gonna focus on trying to figure out each other's love language i'm gonna work on just giving evan words of affirmation and like his character and just to build him up because that's what makes him feel loved and then evan's gonna work on all five for me i guess so so my week is probably going to consist of doing different things to try and figure out what her main love language is well he's already so perfect whatever it's hard for me to think back and be like which one makes me feel the most loved because you already make me feel like love whatever you're wrong anyways no one's perfect and that's okay we can all have room to grow that's just the gospel truth so cheers to this week's vlog and i hope you guys are having a great    saturday    hey it's bad albert that's weird okay it's been about a day since we filmed what you just saw i don't know i was sitting at home i was about to start editing for our upcoming vlog and i was like you know what i'm already home from work showered everything and carlin's been working at boutique all day so i was like you know what i should do i should capitalize on this you know what i'm gonna try and actually do some things around the house just some things that i don't always do some of you will be like look at this guy he's trying to act like uh he's the perfect husband or something and that's not true you'll be able to see that when uh carlin's face is like shocked when she walks in which is what i'm going for and uh we'll see if that's carlin's love language i'm still learning her guys i think all of us guys learn our wives like forever we'll find out like if maybe what would that be works or something what's the love language again something like that we'll see if that's her love language    right now i'm going to sweep and mop a little bit doesn't even really need it but i'm kind of trying to get browning points for this week so you know what fellas you know what's wrong with us let me show you most of us don't even understand this is how you sweep ready you can go back the other way you see what most of us think i'm about to start preaching what most of us think including me and my marriage life at one point in time most of us think we sweep like this bye babe love you hey honey i'm home wow the house magically got swept give me a break guys wow what is this are you serious you mocked my house yeah i'm going all out this week just trying to figure out your love languages if you don't like this then i'll probably never do it again just kidding we had that talk remember for your money girls shouldn't be the only one doing it say hi whoa did you miss daddy today you always miss daddy she just woke up so she's really shocked wow evan you are the bomb.com wow you're really up in it a notch this week maybe we should like give ourselves a reward man you're going all out okay what do you mean i don't think we should do something like have an incentive yeah like a reward if we're gonna try and do really good for you make this fun okay i'm just really glad we started doing this here because i feel like it's been so good and i don't think you should ever stop working on your marriage yeah well i want to hear more about this incentive we should both get something like like yes something you already know what we haven't done this since layla bug was born chuck e cheese no we i've never been to chuck e cheese i know it was a joke i love chugging cheese

carlyn's never come golfing with me kind of nervous i'm excited because i'm gonna try and press her and stuff and i'm not that good at golf yet so you always impress me even if you're not good at golf you don't have to be good at golf to impress thanks but guys thank you you led into that just when i would say that i actually didn't mean to but it worked out perfectly so this is me trying to come true on my promise to my husband he's been like talking up golf how fun it is it's the best thing ever and you get to ride in this card all day so it's gonna be so fun well tell them what happened evan the nicer course that i've been going to i've never made a tea time because it's like a nice course but it's not insanely nice like a lot of fancy places so i've gone with my pastor and we've never made tea times we just show up i guess saturdays are different because it's probably so busy but because he didn't think about it being saturday so now we're going to like a par 3 course which is still fun but i don't get to use my driver and they don't have a cart yeah so i'm not really sure how that's going to go seeing the babies in the backseat and we actually don't have her stroller with us today yeah because i took it out to go on a walk so i felt like our saturday plans are just killing it now we'll see if even this par three is open if it's not i'll probably just cry okay carlyn's now starting to feel a little out of the place she said we're going to look weird out there because she's holding her baby and she decided to wear like a outfit she'd go to a party in this is more exercise than i've done like you know look at that you got your own little bench and everything so fun first shot of the day how do you go over by the tree huh i'm kidding he's cute how did daddy do terrible daddy daddy daddy already has him depressed oh my goodness this is like mount everest evan i'm already panting oh actually it was that wasn't bad it's right off the green ah pretty good pretty good low passes i saw people do this i'm learning how to putt all right i'll take it for part i think she's getting done how many more do we have already we're on hole number two oh hole number two guys whoop whoop and how many are there carlyn's already losing interest i think totally into this biggest cheerleader go evan go dad do you have a name i should call you no i'm not good enough for a nickname yet oh yes you are we'll think of one this hole was 174 it's like the longest par 3 here and i will take that for me that's not bad it was almost straight on with the pin just a little short okay i am going to let carlin take a swing at it pun intended but you put it on this side yep right yep can't say it helps based on the way i've been playing but okay wow you look like you know what you're doing that's right bend your knees get a little loose put some pinkies around something there you go not bad not bad at all i did that for my first time great job that was better than most of the ones i've shot today whoa that was a beautiful shot right on this one of the day but that's because this hole's so small letting carlin put this one and then we got the other one right there basically like we're having a little putt off um medium hard these greens not that medium hard i didn't know how hard you swing now i'm gonna say soft hard not that soft i'm playing it safer than sorry there you go all right you guys um it's been fun had some bad shots had some okay shots i think you did awesome lately fell asleep for part of it so that was good yeah and i could use some pointers so if any of you guys have people you know that know how to golf or you know how to golf dm me come give me some lessons i'm sorry but i just can't get over how like she watches your every move she loves it every time i went to golf and she couldn't see him she'd be like that is true she'd start crying and carlin would turn around and she'd love it turn around chico thanks for coming along with us today it was fun i gotta get better but it's fun being out here i love carlin and layla coming we'll head on to the next segment we told you guys that we would update you about the land that we were looking at music from the heavens    yeah we um put in an offer so we'll see how that goes more nervous yeah yeah that's just a little update on that in the meantime we're just chilling in our cozy home oh also guys it's basically christmas okay because the last two days have been cold and we officially have cut on the heat okay not cold it makes me happy so it's basically christmas christmas i'm coming for you not cold like 59 at like the lowest pretty much well i think it feels like christmas and i'm very excited about it because i actually put on the heat today it's basically christmas what can i say daddy ordered you something super special so i got on amazon and i was looking for things to get laila even though she's still young but she's getting old enough to realize stuff yeah yeah i think so like watch this watch this right layla layla hey layla hey i love you i don't think it was because of her name i think it was because you screamed well either way she's observant so i got her uh some baby nail polish because like baby nail polish toxic free yachting oh yeah um so i didn't know that was a thing i was just gonna go to the old wally world and get uh some nail polish and carlin informed me that that can poison babies so don't do that get toxic free well it's all kinds of stuff free it's very like water-based yeah yeah it's everything free for baby but daddy wants to paint your nails so i'm ready are you ready let's do this this is good this can't be that hard this is like your first what daddy-daughter date-ish pedicure well this just happened

then i got a serious question to ask you yeah um why is layla getting a pedicure before you give me a pedicure you've never given me a pedicure because um i know layla won't sit still long enough to pay for her to get one but i know that i can't do a pedicure near as well as the professionals so i just pay for you to get them done instead of you just going through the pain of me doing it okay it's for you not me you have any hot rocks not hot but warm you stay there okay oh oh okay hang on hang on layla we're gonna roll your pants up that's enough let you know i'm thinking about adult feet i'm sorry ready does that feel good you want this foot too okay in between the toes in between the toes this little piggy went to the market this little piggy went to the baseball game this little piggy went to chuck e cheese this little piggy stayed at home and this little piggy got a pedicure you've got that all wrong i was making them up wow okay she loves massages she's thoroughly enjoying

i'm not the big one oh yeah girlfriend y'all aren't that sweet that's my heart can't make it she's like me her feet go out if you haven't noticed sometimes i walk like a penguin sometimes my feet angle outward and that's what she's doing so when she lays her feet down she gets it on the towel    no she keeps rubbing it off she just wiped all of them on her heel i don't worry about that it's water-based but look at her left foot what my foot she wiped it all off on her oh and they look so good you just wait right there no do not redo it all right final shot of these beauties they look gorgeous we are going to end this vlog right here right yeah are we done yeah thanks for watching like this because my husband deserves all the likes so just hit that thumbs up okay that was so cute my heart is exploding just a little bit trying to keep the emotional tears in because that was so sweet we love you as always thanks for watching thanks for watching you're the best you're the best and and her toes should end this vlog it's only fair that right in this vlog and we'll see you next week what's up my people look who's coming guys okay guys welcome to this week's vlog this is carlin's reward for a couple videos ago she said she want to stay in a hotel but tell him you changed her yeah i changed my mind one because everything's crazy and it's a lot of money so we decided to make a family camping trip i don't know that she's too excited about it okay so evan just went and got our little spot trying to find where where our little camping spot is what number are we 17 17. it wasn't going well it was kind of like the golf video last week if you watched that how i couldn't get uh into the nice course because i didn't reserve a tee time he didn't reserve us a campground either no one told me that you had to reserve campgrounds normally by this time of year they say they're not that busy but they are so we drove around to multiple campgrounds and finally found one oh look at the tents how cool are we so we've never been camping together as a family so this is our very first time in layla's first time to go camping was kind of exciting not really sure how it's going to go just going to wing it we're pro campers where is we going to put our tent right there most people have campers i feel like we're out of place i expected it to be like you just hike down a trail and then you find a little circled area with a fire pit and you just get to throw up your own camp apparently layla did too let's do this this is gonna be fun stuart family goes camping are you burping are you burping you guys hungry um so some of you guys actually may not have even known this about me i'm uh i'm a pretty i would almost say professional camper in a way um maybe the camo in the hood gave it away but um this comes naturally to me i brought my my boots i'm gonna put my boots on get at it with setting up the tent just uh become one with nature she knows i'm hot let's set up the tent you can see i'm in my camping attire got my boots my kind of work pants rough tough ones carhartt that's real tough people wear that like i said earlier got the camo camo in the back let you know i'm serious uh got a flashlight for later got a uh wow that was hot got a couple lighters we're pretty set to go    how to set up tent model number and t41 done extending lock poles oh extend that's why you wear boots we could probably blow it out up out here yeah slide it and squeeze it through the door hey carlin was right you should have blown it up inside but it all worked out look at camp mom over here hey you are you having fun are you loving this are you having so much fun do you love being outside you loved it he loved it all right we're about to go out on a walk see what all's around here a little warm but us campers we love the outdoors we love our state gotta support my state today tennessee the only ten i see rough tough people i don't know what i'm gonna do with him do you think of camping so far she loves the outdoors so we're gonna look for some firewood on our way okay okay why didn't you ask for that spot by the way i don't think there are any available guess that's what we get for not making a reservation maybe next time you'll think about that i'm kidding that's on me look at that see if we could have been this one right here babe how would you like that that's what we needed yeah that's what we needed hey let me know if you see any sticks there we go look at that layla you wanna go get on the swing you wanna go get on this ring said she's gonna fall asleep she might already be this is fun isn't it this is makes you slow down and realize what's important in life enjoy each other instead of being so rushed all the time    hold on tight underdog is coming up ready       all right we're back carlin i think she's gonna lay layla down for a nap guess i'm gonna focus on the fire i got some firewood    she's loving this i think she's loving it more than us even all right little update for you uh so we've been out here for a few hours now i did run to walmart not really seeing much wood around here so what i did remember i told you guys i was a professional camper i just went with these so supposedly you just light it and it stays lit for three hours and that's all you gotta do you are so beautiful to me and can't you see you're everything okay smelly mommy say hi are you having fun somebody's having   feel weird if other people see me they're gonna mock me looks like a loaf of bread there he goes this is a true test is it working i don't know it said something about don't cook with it but it said no barbecuing but it's probably okay no probably probably but not chemicals that'll kill you will it well this seems to be working well what is it doing we have fire you have fire where this one's really hot it's trying to go out i don't know what this is evan what did you do wrong looks like you're supposed to light the package that it's in uh so we're going to give that a try now but you shouldn't have taken it out of there or torn it right or torn the packet well we'll see i think it's gonna work it's gonna burn the paper inward and then get underneath it i hope that guy didn't see this because that's embarrassing that's really embarrassing is he talking about me are they still looking no just straight over here that's so weird can you take her to the tent and put it i'm gonna just oh yeah we're cooking now literally you ready for a hot dog but look though look what i got going i am so proud of you that's so amazing wow you are like a camper i think the chemicals are turning into darker color than normal exactly don't eat that evan give me that water butter it's still cold in the center it's not like a real fire carlin's literally eating a chip bun hot dog babe come on what i can figure this out i'm fine i'll go see it i can't it's literally what time is it i'll go see if the campground has like what i can buy i should do that i've always wanted one of these i have no try it's really good doritos on a sandwich it's so good i needs my water and we'll eat some s'mores cold smores so i just look at this as like just a fun memory you know just another chance to show people life's not perfect dr truth life's not always roses and fires sometimes it's it appears to be perfect what that's the point but it doesn't look at that we could probably do the marshmallows what do you think i think if we hold him high enough i don't think he'd kill us yeah because i don't even like marshmallows so i think we could still do this so it's the best both worlds we just didn't do the hot dogs i mean we're watching what everyone else is eating around yeah then over there they got like a big sit-down meal we're trying not to be jealous it's taken potatoes but we got hot dog buns and chips what a fun family memory oh the sky's turning i'm glad i messed up the fire me too me too i'm not really chips keep going down the wrong way but layla is staring apart but like it's the greatest thing that ever happened to the human race are you enjoying this oh don't get too big of a bite she's not fighting at all at least you're still having fun with us this is so fun isn't it we're gonna remember our first family camping trip for the rest of our lives we're twinning and honestly if dad would have just done better with the firewood it would have been worse because i feel like that was my one job i feel like that was the only thing i had to do and don't make me laugh i was gonna go buy something and then i think i could have built a fire maybe we should just pray that one of these other people next to us will like look over and see my puny little [ __ ] and they'll like bring us some food or something this guy over here has like steak and potatoes on tinfoil above his fire and his fire is really nice and it looks like a really good potato i'm closing my eyes imagine it i'm eating potatoes all right we're giving the marshmallows a shot i don't think it's going to kill us if we just kind of barely get it dark i wouldn't hold it too close why ain't it turning around all right we need to redo something no one will ever know may we just say delicious look at that see i don't think the chemical will be a problem i think it was great you made it perfect i don't think the chemicals matter did the package say chemicals if they do not cook over it is it barbecuing but barbecue's like a different meal that's like pulled pork and stuff so s'mores aren't considered barbecuing probably no judgement on our first camping trip round two is gonna be pretty legit i'll remember to bring some firewood okay carlyn's pretty sure that this was her first s'more she's ever had in her life officials more because i don't like marshmallows so you don't like that then it's not that bad because the marshmallows melted right i think the reason i don't like marshmallows yeah me too i'm not a big marshmallow it's not that bad painting some pajamas pink big q little q what begins with q quick queen of quincy and her quacking quacker big r little r what begins with r i was about to go to bed so big t little t what begins with t ten tired turtles on a tuttle tuttle tree big x little x what begins with x x-ray and xylophone so we will update you uh we're gonna head to bed soon and put layla to bed so enjoy the last few moments by the fire so we'll update you in the morning we'll see you then carlyn says she's out of here she said there was a mosquito on her wrist so i slapped her wrist and then i started feeling it on me and i was like that feels too big to be a mosquito it was a grand daddy long laying big spider yeah and it was crawling around we were just laying there talking just like chilling well she fell asleep on me but she was like she's farted the whole time we've been out here today she has a little bed in the corner that we brought her little snuggle me but y'all i felt it on my arm and carlin did too    i know believe me i didn't like it either and i think i've got poison ivy or something are you kidding me i don't think it was from today how fast does poison ivy show up so i'm feeling stuff crawling on me now this is annoying that's right it's about that time we're gonna pack up head home get ready for church carlyn did not sleep that well i felt like i was scared she was gonna wake up okay guys that was officially like the funnest like we had a blast did you have a blouse i had a blast now it's early and we're heading out for church it is early we threw everything in the car i wish you could see it back there it's ridiculous we're gonna have to organize it i think we get that way more than we needed as well and also this is our first time camping so we weren't sure like how layla was gonna do so we only did one night because it was raining friday night so we ended up doing it on saturday night and so since we have to get up so early for church we're on the way home now gonna get ready for church head there but all in all i feel like it was so much fun i think layla had the time of her life guys like she loved just laying on that blanket and looking at the grass and looking at everything and trying to get to it she loved it the walks the swing sets the like water it was just beautiful it was beautiful even my experience was supper i was full i went to bed full okay it was so fun it was definitely a trip to go down in the books i'm so glad we did it thanks for taking me camping babe of course we'll do it again sometime and i'll try and bring some firewood yeah it was fun thanks for watching you guys like subscribe turn on post notifications so you don't miss anything see you next week id it zoom in too much am i too

movie be a journeyman that's like yeah because i'm in my apprenticeship become a journey he's almost there being a movie that would be sick yeah okay let's see mine is face paint yes i've never faced painted my face before and i've always wanted to do face things this is on me carla has told me for a while that she would love to get her face painted and i'll be honest with you like when i first hear that i'm like i'm gonna make that dream come true because it's simple and she like gets so excited about soaking sweet but i also forget about it because it's so simple like we could just go to the carnival and get your face painted so we're gonna do that one of these things oh why of course that's on both of our bucket lists we'd love to go there skydiving real tree for christmas oh we did that that's gonna be like our tradition is picking out a real tree every year for christmas have a pool yeah that's a dream make a cd oh a whole cd we've recorded a song but not a whole lot yeah we have a single out if you haven't heard it it's called show you i do evan wrote it for our wedding um but i would love to like do a hen cd rayleigh warren says when are you having any more kids to be honest i'll just keep it simple we are so happy where we're at right now yeah not that another child wouldn't make us any more happy but just we would love it just on the right timing spending time with layla and stuff and just enjoying being married i mean layla's still under a year old so we don't really know when the next one's coming but you know i would love a house by that time yeah that would be nice hey god's in control yeah we're getting and we just want to enjoy all of the little moments that we're having right now with her stephaniekd71 says whose family do y'all decide to go to for holidays normally on the actual holiday we're able to go to my family a lot her family's so big they normally do celebrations around a holiday my mom tries to do a really good job of doing it either before the weekend before the week and after so that the married couples can go to their in-laws so it works out really nice it's very nice all right okay so here's a deep one you got to open up a little bit be vulnerable yeah okay give it to me we're not used to being vulnerable it's not like we make videos and post it online for everyone to see and to comment about harper yanz says what is your most recurring argument and how do you plan to get past it oh really deep okay it's our most preparing argument probably that he works too i was gonna say it i really was that's how well we know each other it's like we're on a telephone line hello oh yes this is carlin yes i knew you were gonna say that that's because i'm pretty sure my love language is quality time well i feel like i never see him he's always working which i love it because he does so much for our family but at the same time it's kind of sad because i feel like it's cause i love them so much and laila's awake we can bring her in hi vlog family let's see how long she'll last so it's not just that i work a lot though like i'm not one of these husbands that's just working a ton of overtime yeah more worried about the money than working with my than spending time with my family but just with school two nights a week at church and just everything it seems like we're always going so evan's kind of like set up time limits and i'm trying to do the same thing of like okay five o'clock this time this many times a week this is our time to just like get on the same page again because sometimes i feel like if you don't pause and take in those little moments you miss them you want to ask this question say who is your favorite daddy or mama okay um whoever's your favorite look at them that's not fair she stares at him    it's not you there joy for sight which is like carter she said would you i'll ever consider moving from tennessee to arkansas should we let's do it okay guess so all right we're we're moving see ya boy i'm going downstairs to get the suitcases and then we went later was like where's dad oh suitcases weren't down there guess we're not moving one day that would be really awesome if like our both of our lives like aligned to somehow live beside each other all i know is i cannot wait to come see you i'm like counting down the days to meet your baby girl carl's given layla a snack i'll answer this for myself sid the champ 87 dream car question mark gotta be a tesla you know what i'm saying okay i can't say dream car if somebody's gonna give me a ferrari or something probably but like teslas are pretty sick they drive shouldn't that be the opposite for us i should be the man on a big big mail truck i do love trucks but they're teslas are sick they're way too expensive all of them are too expensive it's called a dream car oh okay haley methvin do you guys use presets for your instapix if not what do you use to edit them yes i do i use the vsco app and i use the presets that are on there and then i just tweak a little bit of stuff i think it's hb2 aaron t white 1992 what's the most challenging thing you have faced together well i feel like we've had it so good compared to most because i know so many friends and like you hear so many stories of people that have gone through tragic things especially recently two things come to my mind it would have to be back in february which is when a lot of the stuff hit with layla as well as carlyn going into the hospital yeah off the stage when she had her meningitis i didn't know if i was gonna lose her and like i'm not just saying that like the doctor came in and said if it's bacterial if it's this you know she could have a 50 50 chance of living that's scary to hear i mean as a husband i didn't know what to think crazy didn't end up being bacterial and then not to mention that's the same weekend layla went in the hospital and we started dealing a lot with her breathing i think it all hit us at once but i'll go ahead and answer about layla because i've actually got a lot of questions on my instagram about how she's doing in the next step she has been doing so much better she's been so strong i feel like and we're actually just waiting on a follow-up appointment if you know past vlogs the issue with our heart they are hoping that it heals on its own nothing like big that's happened so we're just keeping her follow-up appointments consistent and we'll let you know but she seems to be doing so much better my kah06 says how tall is carlin i am just under 5'4 olivia hogan03 how did you know it was time to propose when she told me to then just move what old person things do you do you guys are awesome well first of all you're sweet second of all i don't know that this is an old person thing i do but it's what i want to do i really want to get a robe and some house shoes this winter he said that since we got married he wanted me to put it on our wedding registry um just one of those plush ones that's comfy when it's cold outside around the house betty f joe says have you and carlin had any past relationships this is good and what do you define a relationship as carlin liked the boy when she was younger carla had a guy before me it didn't work out praise the lord because now i'm married to her and you ready i wouldn't be here if it did and uh i had a girl i liked in first grade through like fifth or sixth grade oh i didn't like anybody until i was like yeah yeah you like someone so young where's gray i was preppy i love your name it was bailey um and she actually liked me like we were marrying joseph in the church little play and all my little friends in the fifth grade like were singing says who's the spender and who's the saver it varies yeah it buries which is weird yeah cause sometimes i'm like when he's weak i'm like strong no we budget budget budget and then when i'm wait keystrong so oh so pretty much we're just selfish if i want to buy myself something she says she wants to buy herself something no we do we balance each other out really well techton designco says any update on the land question mark this is so sad guys cue the sad music evan i told myself that because i edit the videos actually that beautiful land we were talking to you guys about and it's been on past vlogs we put an offer in and the offer fell through which is really sad um they wanted more for it than we could like offer at this time so we just thought it wasn't a wise move but we're not stressing you know god's in control we're just living life we're chilling and we feel like when god like wants us to move like he's gonna make it so clear that's what we're praying like you lead us and direct us when it's your time to move we'll move as long as we're obedient gotta work it out mallory may j says what made you guys start a youtube channel oh this is actually really good yeah i think my side was definitely just for like the home footage and growing up like looking back on memories it's like a scrapbook to us just in video form evan loved it for the fact of this is like his hobby he loves editing he loves videoing we truly appreciate like all the support the love you guys are like our family literally and i love the network that youtube can create um and bring people together so if you want to keep tagging along hit that subscribe button elizabeth says was it hard facing things in each other's past when you started dating we all you know we all mess up but we get another chance god's grace is more than that and his forgiveness is yeah don't

this cute i think this is cute what are you doing i'm going through my closet i think that's the giveaway pile and i think i'm keeping this pile layla what do you think of this layla are you healthy mommy oh careful go back over there to your barricade but here's the problem well the problem is there's literally like so many clothes um let me just pan this you watch her okay here's a pan um i don't even really know what's going on like layla's gonna drown in these clothes listen here's the problem there's two things one when i got married like a bunch of this clothes is just like hand-me-down stuff and then also i think some of it some of my sisters and i took it anyways so i have a ton of clothes but all of them aren't technically mine and some of them are like eight years old and then wait so you're telling me this closet was full to the brim and you're down to just like this pile right here now yeah because the problem was i had way too many clothes this can only mean that like she's gonna wanna go like spend a lot of money at the mall and like no i'm not and secondly my closet's really small look at it hey i'm not coming all my stuff has to fit in that so i need to like squish it down hey see i'm kind of a sentimental guy though like i like to keep stuff for instance this is the very shirt that like i started dating carlin in well not dating it was the shirt she was wearing when i thought she was pretty and i thought i liked her so see we need to like frame this this is not a giveaway memory is just going down the drain you're doing your clothes next and look i already went through all the bathroom cabinets i went through all of that toiletry cabinet i'm also went through all the cabinets in the living room oh okay that's interesting because the last time she acted this way is when she was pregnant with layla so it's kind of raising a lot of questions uh in dad's mind over here um like one like you should take a pregnancy test um because she's in like i don't know she seems like she's in nesting mode again i probably should take one do we do i have one all right carlyn's taking a pregnancy test right now hey you think you're ready to be a big sister are you ready to be a big sister i don't know probably not probably not i don't know we'll see it's interesting but lava's loving the clothes it's like a mountain for her swimming in clothes it's every girl's dream layla you're living the dream early what this is kind of cool that we're finding out with you guys i think it's no because i'm like not expecting to be so i like if you're not expecting then you're not pregnant get it because they call it expecting i'm not nervous it's been three minutes it's been three i think where in three minutes an unmistakable yes or no will appear so a word yesterday yep all right where is it it's under here let me look let me look let me look let me look let me look come on i'm starting to get excited now because like that could totally say yes and this could totally turn to a different vlog we better be buckle up baby can i look i get two all right at the same time close yeah all right three two one    wow every time i take a pregnancy test so i get so like i know i was actually getting built up are you gonna get built up this is kind of sad babies are awesome well oh oh no are you serious why would it say on were you serious yeah i'm not screened what a blooper reel that's hilarious she thought it said on instead of no but i don't know what on would have meant baby oh okay guys so also something else happened really funny last week that evan did he conquered like his biggest fear i know where you're going he's gonna have to throw up some of my instagram stories i did almost throw up we weren't vlogging when we did this but we did like buy the footage on the ride because it was kind of funny so just watch this hopefully you guys will get a laugh at my expense i guess okay guys i really really really need your help because i'm trying to talk evan into doing this ride and he's like no way look guys it's so cool what is it called put the camera around oh there it goes it's these big things and it's the slingshot and it's so freaking cool and he is like not for it come on party tell me tell me if you should do it yes or no yes yes yes evans look of terror he's watching the video of people doing it what you thinking i don't want to do this oh come on really all right you don't have to you don't want to you don't have to if you don't want to what'd you say a while ago i need to go to the bathroom first

probably tell by the title of this video but we are filming a new intro yeah if you've been watching our videos the last like what probably two months uh you notice there's no intro at the beginning we were supposed to do this a long time ago but carlin told me to stop putting it in because her hair was brown layla was like a newborn and she said it just didn't fit i've been so busy haven't filmed a new one we're gonna try and knock that out today along with maybe a little something that some of you guys suggested where evan recreates carlin's instagram photos we'll see we might try and work that in uh we'll see how that goes but it's gonna be fun so we're gonna bring you along for all that carl's saying we gotta tidy up the house before we go out and do anything today layla has showed her toys around lately you need to pick up your toys so it looks like dad will be picking up her toys we'll watch you though oh they'll watch me there you go lila's gotten to the stage where she puts anything she finds in her mouth take that toy instead of putting stuff in your mouth i vacuum like 20 times a day and dad's cleaning up the toys bad cleaning up wow father of the year i'm just kind of thinking i should deserve it    if you think i deserve an award for father of the year then knock these things over knock them over yep all right i mean she chose it not me hey you want

photos okay so i'm working on this one first so i think i'm just gonna wear my white t-shirt and roll the sleeves up to make it sleeveless because i don't have a white sleeveless okay so i take back that last statement this is as far as i'm going with it i found carlin's extensions from her wedding yeah that's as far as i'm going with recreating the rest is just guy virgin you get like that it's pretty close you might have to look at the photo though    one down i don't see how girls do this i got hair all in my mouth we're working on this one there you go oh there's a swipe and there's the other one we'll see which one works out best probably this one so that we don't have to smile look yours were going elbows in here on the there we go    okay all right we're good just one more okay i got one more in me what in the world is your father wearing layla what are you doing you'll see you're not supposed to be looking yet wait don't come in yet all right i don't know why evan picked this

video carl's want to spend a lot of money so y'all got to help me talk her down this is not true i'm not i just think that our living room needs a little update okay so i'm going to have to give you some pans of the living room because if carlyn gets her way it's about to look a lot different what we're trying to do is we're trying to sell a lot of the stuff in our living room online some of it we already have listed up some of it we're gonna list up and then we're gonna take that money and redo our living room i guess i think it's fine look i'm sitting on the couch it's comfortable but she wants a different style the farmhouse style we got i mean look at this i can't i'll be honest i can't stand this we got a basket in our living room with a chicken on it says farmer's market literally looks like we went down to the local like farmer's grocery store and just stole their bucket of eggs or something don't say that well i love it i'm just saying i don't know but it's okay because we're gonna redo it anyway so grab me a napkin oh you get spilled food oh my goodness she just got it all over her sweatshirt i just put on her what is it you gotta do rubber nose in it or something and she won't do it anymore no that's when a dog goes to the bathroom in the house i think do any moms attempt to feed their kid like this because i think oh it'll be fast this one time i won't get nothing on her outfit and then it looks like this we'll have carlin after she's done cleaning up the baby explain what her thoughts are i guess we're gonna run out shopping i mean we're gonna have to get on top of this we're gonna have to get a lot done while i'm home with her she's gonna want to get a lot done gonna want to use these muscles uh ain't that right babe so going for like a minimalist like mid-century style the century modern very like clean looking because our house is smaller so i want it to be very open oh okay and i was texting jess and jana last night some friends of ours really late like give me your inspiration she's literally been on her phone for like a whole day she's been texting people looking stuff up so i'm kind of worried about the budget on this one no i'm gonna stick to the budget evan well we're gonna use the money that we make from selling other items in the living room and then i don't know i may be generous and give her like 50 bucks on top of that unbelievable i know i didn't think i'd give you that much either so follow along if you want to see the living room makeover we're going shopping to get us some inspiration hopefully matt can find a few pieces    are you just chilling   somebody's in a not smiley mood today and mom's looking at all the stuff trying to figure out what to buy hmm pull it down here i think it's fine i think it looks like a good style you can say that because it's cheap cheap it's not cheap your definition of cheap is stupid let me try it trying to see if i can picture myself just chilling in the living room eating a snack i don't know where'd you go okay uh that didn't work out too well she got some inspiration yeah it got inspiration that's what it was mainly for so we can find a cheaper version of it somewhere oh i'm all for that yeah we'll look online see if we can find something cheaper yeah now you're talking now that's my girl i'm just talking all right we're gonna head home maybe we'll get a snack on the way home or something i don't know let's go we'll get home let's work well we can take a little break but then we gotta go home and start going through stuff because if you're ordering

the house uh packing up some bags loading up the car and uh heading back to the hospital because this night's about to get crazy it's an update record well you wanted to see yourself you're not using this clip i look like a drug addict look at my eyes how puffy they are it's guys it's been in the hospital guys a little update never made it back he conquered through and packed all of our hospital bags that i should have done weeks ago it's not your fault i should have done a lot i should have put the car seat in but you did did you figure it out no no i just threw it in the back seat okay we're gonna hook it up before we leave i'm actually having consistent contractions which is cool and i got my steroid shot so i'm waiting on it she was a trooper like they said steroid shot's gonna be bad and i was holding their hands nothing's working nothing's worse than having to take two shots your whole pregnancy every single day so i think that's helped my hair's still soaking i'm gonna shower yeah looks like dreadful i'm not hoping i'm just gonna like fall asleep and wake up beautiful baby you look beautiful oh and pretty sure i got my very first iv that i like ever had in my life that i can remember and it's my very first time to be admitted to a hospital a lot of firsts the first baby first pregnancy first i'm just taking it each like a few minutes at a time because everything's new i feel like he's still doing me a terrible angle sorry yeah oh let's show them the room got the little luggage area the vlog editing going on yeah evans bed nice little board right now it's a little after 12 20 past midnight supposed to be sleeping but i i just there's so many emotions like this is our last night together yeah is that a baby it's so sweet evan's been so good thanks babe the first thing he said when he got to the hospital was what did you say oh yeah i said tell me what you expect what do you expect guys that's that's our number one problem is we don't know what they expect and half that falls on us and half that falls on them because sometimes they say yeah but i just thought that's what you were gonna do and i'm like you know my advice you know what i'm saying if you're pregnant right now near your third trimester just go ahead and pack your bags smart get your hair done like you wanted to go do your nails so they don't look like this okay yeah let's tell them tell them everything we wanted to do all right let's start from the beginning we wanted to have the bags packed didn't wanted to have the car seat in the car buckled in everything wanted to get her hair done i actually had an appointment for that today yeah and it was gonna be like gorgeous yeah didn't get it i wanted to get your nails done didn't get it wanted to clean the car out didn't oh yeah yeah is it dirty i really need to vacuum it out but i feel so like at peace being here monitoring her knowing she's okay yeah it's like such a relief because i think i'm so emotional explaining the doctor's office explain how it went down okay so i am going for a regular routine checkup this morning and i'm thinking no big deal you know i only have a few appointments left before she's here and so i go in and i go to get my ultrasound and there's like four signs or whatever they want you to pass part b movement something water and so she actually went through and passed all of them but respiratory motion so we were there for 30 minutes and she didn't get it then we took a break i ate stuff like had soda and then did it for another 30 minutes we still weren't get wasn't getting movement so then they put me on a heart monitor to do a stress test for like 45 minutes to an hour and there was like some dips in her something and so then they did me another test for 30 minutes to see ultrasound to see if they could get the movement and they weren't getting what they want but at the very toe end she started making a little bit of movement but i think the doctor was kind of like better safe than sorry and at least monitor her so one i'm nervous because of course i was bawling like crazy like oh my goodness is my baby girl okay yes i would be better see okay out of all the appointments i miss like for at first you know doctors are so chill and so i was thinking oh it's okay they're like i'm like i got a hair appointment at 1 30 like you know i need to get out here and then it was like a few seconds after the like second and third test it was kind of like all right they're not playing around yeah they're like still here see i don't get to go to every appointment it's just hard with work so i try to go to the ones that i feel are going to be the biggest like big sounds gender reveal so i try to make it to what i can we decided for me not to go to this one it was just you know getting close to the birth thought it was just a routine her mom went with her yeah which is so great yeah that was good i'm kind of texting him i'm always like trying to watch the clock and find out how the appointment goes and how the ultrasound went and make sure her little girl's healthy so she's telling me that uh they don't think it's as big of a deal they're gonna monitor stuff check it and she'd let me know if i needed to come or whatnot well then towards the end you know they kind of start saying possibly going back and forth of what to do and also a lot of you know that i have blood disorder and so i have to take two heparin shots while i've had to take two heparin shots every day throughout my pregnancy and so they say there's a lot of risk in that once you hit past like 36 weeks of you know your placenta rupturing and then still bursts and all kinds of crazy so i think with all of it involved i think the doctor thought it was why this at least monitored through the night and then get things going because i was already showing progress of being two something centimeters dilated and contractions like consistently so they said so here we are let's just go ahead and head over and we'll start the inducement i cannot believe i'm about to see you as a dad it's gonna be such an emotional moment i'm gonna be so excited y'all this is how excited we are it is officially 12 30 okay and we can't still up we're just anticipating tomorrow but anyways the lord's blessed today just for us to be here and chances are such a good doctor and not taking a hospital like not taking chance not take a chance that something would happen throughout the next week or whatever just just to go ahead and be here and you hear it over there your little heartbeat we'll see her we'll meet her tomorrow right less than 24 hours we'll see you guys    here we are uh making progress yay we're almost there nine and a half centimeters she's killing it so

were going to pick it up i think while i was at school because our first year of marriage like evan worked a ton so we were both working like really long hours and then we ended up not being able to go to the christmas tree farm because like the trees were gone or they were closed by that time sometimes something so we ended up getting a walmart tree we just went to walmart and picked up a real oh like it's real but it's like from walmart so we didn't get to like pick it off we should probably just do that again it's probably cheaper no it's supposed to be family tradition that we get a real tree every single year and this will be so fun with laila because she's older anyway she's gonna we're gonna do that hopefully tomorrow and secondly you said good news bad news this is oh what's the

yeah because he's got a truck and i need to get a manly truck but i don't have one isaiah's here as well this is going to be on what kind of manly truck eva needs okay i like that a little dodge a big old cummins a ford a chevy what do y'all think evan should sound good yeah i just need a big manly truck you're more like a little toyota tundra kind of guy though i would take that too honestly all right let's uh let's pick a tree now we can't cut any down in the field um probably because they're not done growing or they have coated on there it just looks like that's going to be what one of our trees just because it's 20 20. what else can pretty much yeah it's 20 20 and that's what the christmas trees look like that's about how the year's gone you got a good christmas tree yeah i actually don't know if there's like a rule to it or i've never picked one out if you pull the needles off very easily maybe it's ripe i don't really know let's let layla pick it up what it means you want to pick up the tree do you want to pick up the tree go pick up one all right so we do get to pick from these though under the tent that they've already got pre-cut and ready i'm a photographer oh this is recording hi dirty lens are you the angel on top of the tree    oh too soft too hard that one wow i just spotted it after trey spotted it oh that one's actually pretty but it's shorter all the way around but it is nice is that about the height tracer no i mean we could go about a foot higher all right funny story guys last year we went to get a tree and we got like a foot too tall and we had to cut the whole bottom off it was so bad that one's a little too thin for me this has ugly branches yeah i don't like that style so i think we're back to the remainder that's probably bermuda style see i don't even know what this stuff is but if you just act confident in what you're saying it sounds like you know yeah right through the fat tree i like that i don't like the yeah these look weird i like more of the style of that one back there i think we're gonna get back to our first that six foot one was pretty good well let's look at these real quick uh it's got a weird shape because this is more complicated it's not it's not symmetrical uh it's the pricing i'm not gonna look at it until we find the right one and then i'll look and be like oh no wonder we like it that's the more expensive one i think we're back to our first i think we're back today we better get there for someone else to take something but i like the fatness of this one this one that looks like a bush now here's the thing if these were people you would not judge them this way people are perfect no matter what but trees you can judge i think it's my favorite i say just do it it's just a tree what do we do do we put a tag on it bellhop we want this tree y'all guess how much it is yellow is probably mid-range a yellow tag is a whopping total of at least okay well it's not the hundred dollar one okay takes a hundred dollars i don't even see a red oh it says no flagging means it's 65 so if we just take the yellow flag off it's 65. no i'm kidding not going to do that kidding don't do that when you go to a tree farmer okey dokey thank you you're welcome you're following these people whoa that's how they wrap it that was very fast yeah it's really easy yeah i could have done that probably you probably could have wow i don't know though i've never worked with trees so we might just bring our presents down there you go take care of it if you don't mind just sliding them through okay this is going to get crazy yeah watch out i think they're going to hire me next year once they see my tree lifting capabilities        y'all this is what you're voting on the truck like this forever that's right feed the house we will follow you all right where's the tree going um i gotta find the tree stand found it all right where are we gonna put it because we got a ton of junk over here stuff carlin's wanting to get rid of and that's where we put it last year so do we remove all the it's very yellow lamps though very warm i like cooler lamps i know i like cooler ones like what's in these we got to get all our christmas stuff out now and decorate probably have to do that next time but now we're going to try and set the tree up leila are you helping daddy uh back this way what in the world it's a little crooked does it look crooked yeah it's going to the left oven do you like the tree whoa she's looking at it like can i touch it we don't have like a tea job look we actually do don't judge yeah evan don't do that well i'm just gonna see if it works where's your measuring cup i'm gonna dump it everywhere oh i didn't dump it this everywhere the floor um no it went in pretty good about four more of those i think it looks great all right i think we're going to call it quits right there tonight the tree is up and it's ready to be decorated so we'll get on that here shortly shout out to t-ray and isaiah for helping us out you guys at bomb.com anything to say babe we love you love you guys subscribe and we'll see you next week foreign    oh did you hear that oh did you hear that what's up stew girl all right we're gonna jump right into it today we are doing what do they call it a mukbang a mukbang i don't know how they pronounce it but we're doing one of those we are doing a mukbang bang right i'm going to say it both ways because i'm going to find out how it's pronounced i've heard it pronounced both ways all right so you guys loved our last like little fast food video we did it was just kind of fun we honestly loved it but i've heard some good comments about it people are like do it again do something else with food so you know in 2020 i think a lot of uh people's date nights have been like this right here and so in the house yeah so we're kind of switching it up and we're trying one of these mukbangs and also i thought it would be really fun to make it a little more interesting i posted some videos on instagram and asked you guys what are some assumptions that you guys assume about us and so you left us a whole bunch i'm gonna read through a bunch of those that's crazy wow we do this so it's incorporating a whole lot of fun and here's the thing here's the thing we set aside some money in the budget and we went all out at mcdonald's and mcdonald's is already pretty cheap so we didn't break the budget too bad but we got like chicken sandwiches quarter pounders apples big macs they're nuggets they all we're not holiday apple pie which i've been i'm interested to try this and i'm gonna make carlyn try the mcrib yeah i really like the ribs do you like a fries cause that's gonna lay you in your snuggle me okie dokie ladybug should we start answering questions first let me pull something i'm up for whatever as i'm about to dig into some food as well let's go ahead and pray let's pray okay dearly father we thank you for this day in your mini blessings we thank you for the food we pray that you'll just help us have a great rest of the day thank you for just the time to get together with us as a family and have a fun little adventure okey dokey evans i'm gonna get on some of these assumptions that you assume about us first off someone says evan i was thinking you could vent at least 400. uh so that assumption would be accurate um really yeah as you can tell now actually i have not been in the gym in a long time i worked out pretty hard before we got married as most people do and uh getting married and having a kid kind of slows you down so no i've never been the biggest bencher i'm sorry all i see is the red lines like in an eyeball you okay is it better yeah y'all i actually started loving mcdonald's when we did that fast food challenge oh yeah she always i hated it said we'd never go there and when she tried it she was actually like it's kind of good for her fast food she didn't get to go there now you guys hate how you were raised love you guys no not at all no i know i always race at all i actually love it i feel like i had the best childhood my parents were amazing it was so much fun and it was so good everything was centered around jesus right which really made us like i just stepped to my big toe you just stepped your whole foot in mayonnaise did they give us napkins no come on mcdonald's where are you at anyways i was saying they centered everything around jesus which made our bond and strength as we grew older a lot more rooted in that and something that's sure because he is our rock for sure yeah for sure we both grew up in christian homes and i wouldn't trade that for anything in the world but just growing up in a christian home we had parents that you know they tried to keep us from the things they knew would really affect us in our lives and uh i think it was great and i wouldn't trade it for anything all right we also got to dig into some food it's not just all about the questions a lot about the food for me what we got here we got the big mac all right carlin someone says you are going to pop out 294 kids like your whole family does your whole family has 294 kids unbelievable how in the world wow we should win a world they're like rabbits or something if that's the case isn't there an animal that has a lot of offspring big mac was a little on the dry side i didn't get much of that secret specialty sauce so was mine okay please just like the fast food you gotta try everything someone says you don't watch other families youtube channels we actually do there's a few families i love my sister has a youtube channel um jessa joy they have some good wins the lebrons love the fishers back to dude perfect i always liked him yeah evan's going to uh read some of the questions she's for sure trying the mcrib it's back limited time and i don't know i'm interested to see what carlin thinks about it    you gotta try it is a classic pretty phenomenal my burger's a little dry try that that has sauce that is great okay off topic guys but if you guys do not have a snuggle me organic and you have a baby you're missing out they are the bomb.com i know i get lots of questions about this so i'll just answer it now y'all seen the sun go me organic layla has had it since she was itty bitty lifesaver it acts as almost like a second hand for me which is so nice so it kind of hugs them and makes them feel like they're being held which is awesome so layla will chill in there for hours she also can sit up in it she plays with their toys it's like all organic and everything so it's super safe for kids but she has loved it makes little moments like this a little more enjoyable that she has something yeah it kind of gives you time to like almost spend a date time together even when the baby's here like honestly if you have not checked out snuggle me organic you really should it's like on the top list of my baby products that i love there's like three or four and that's definitely i'll use it with every kid let's show them do you love it do you love it see how it kind of wraps up on the edges it's just nice it just kind of keeps them locked in use little head she always scoots up and likes to use this as like a pillow now that she's bigger yeah she does it anyways it's super comfy i'll see if evan can leave like a description underneath so you guys can check it out maybe a good christmas present or something if you know someone that's about to have a baby or you're having one definitely something to invest in completely worth it you spend a lot of time with your families grandparents and siblings etc i'd say that's pretty accurate uh we spend quite a bit of time with my family even in nashville we try to visit there quite a bit uh we spend time with carlin's family here and stuff like that so i'd say that's pretty accurate what would i like to eat next please try it they're gonna want you to try it please why does evan get so much joy out of yeah    that's what's good about it it's got that mcdonald smell to it okay she took a nice sized bite i believe i'll walk up oh come on i even took the onions and pickles off for you okay really just back to the the other food video spitting things out how do you know a big whatever that is i mean it's not disgusting it's just like disgusting so this person assumes that we bike or run or walk every day oh man i i wish jake's when you give me five seven eight ten you owe me more than mcdonald's like we're married we really don't work out and i gain it back like in my face i've gained back a little bit since i did all my keto stuff i'm gonna try and get back on it probably in new year's i'm gonna enjoy christmas but garland just like never gains it's very weird very annoying i'll give you some questions you have 30 seconds to answer like as many as we can really fast okay y'all are the loudest people in your family i'd say that's a very very high probability especially for me my family yes you enjoy roller coasters yes yes okay you're pregnant or will be soon i am not it'd be uh it'd be an impossibility uh we'd be calling guinness book of world records if that was the case not that i know of you live a perfectly happy life no stress no you're going to homeschool layla and siblings uh more than likely yeah yes carlin cries in the car every time evan won't stop to let her pet a dog while they're driving i'll admit she totally seems like that kind of a girl doesn't no okay oh this is funny because last night we had like a 45 minute conversation it was just trying to convince evan to get layla a dog for christmas she doesn't know what you're saying you can say it out loud babe she probably does she wants me to get laila dog for christmas but carlyn's never been a dog person my parents have a little yorkie and she loves playing with it she like chases it around she loves it so i want to get a what's the kind of dog i want you said a golden retriever no and she didn't mean that it's like a golden doodle or something yes it's so cute and it's really big and they are like really good with babies they don't shed they're like yeah are you getting excited about it it's like what's the other thing it does it's hypoallergenic it doesn't shed and it has to be inside i know what it is the other thing is that it's expensive they're insanely expensive so but we could have it inside what do you want to name your doggy i would definitely name it peeve so that i can tell everybody this is my pet peeve no name it like do you want to name it like bubba because she could say that bubba please convince evan to get laila a puppy for christmas oh i did forget to mention stung me organic uh left a code carlin20 for 20 off your first snuggle me if you want to check it out for like a christmas present for this yeah i haven't put it in the description but check it out carlin20 and this is their infant lounger it's she's 10 months old and she's still in it so it will last you for like ever yeah their feet can like hang off and stuff they said it's no big deal so like it'll last you forever if you get one yeah she loves it layla is never going to get married or have a boyfriend because she's your little angel yeah um so that's probably going to be the case because now that i'm a dad i kind of understand how all the dads like in movies and stuff are like no not my daughter you'll never date her and it's like whatever but now i get it uh she woke up this morning and i was laying next to her and she was literally just looking me dead in the eyes her like pretty brown eyes and i i mean i had a moment right then i was like well she's gonna grow it was weird like i never even told carl in that but it was weird it was so sweet and so yeah that's gonna be hard someone said you still have a great relationship with carlin's family even though you wear pants and absolutely my parents are very understanding of once we get married like making choices and decisions on our own and we're so thankful for that they have the sweetest spirit and they encourage us to just follow the lord where we think is best and i love that about that we have an awesome for sure someone says you put makeup on every day a week no i don't have time maybe like twice three times a week probably sunday wednesday and then probably another day a week probably like three times a week you want 15 kids wow i don't think i can handle 15 kids probably six isn't six is the number i enjoy these mukbangs i'll tell you i'll tell you this food's good i'm enjoying this someone said i assume both of y'all saved yourselves for marriage and that would be correct and i encourage everyone to do that it was so special that you are always upbeat and positive i'm not always that beaten positive and i wish i was just all the time but hey are you trying to say hi laila somebody rolled out their snick with me oh someone says not an assumption but y'all inspire me every day in your walk with christ this is so humbling that is so sweet and honestly we just really want to make much of jesus in our lives and if other people can see jesus through shining through us that that's the whole goal honestly yes it's the whole goal so because the thing is like we love making videos on here for you guys and everything but the main part of our life we want to make god the center of everything we do and i mean even on here we don't shy away from praying we don't shy away from telling you guys about our life because god's the biggest part of our life and without him we wouldn't have the ability to do anything that we do i strongly encourage you find christ if you haven't you know he's the best part of your life and he's the only thing that will even make life worth living he has been our rock through every situation in our lives and we have so much peace knowing that he is in control especially with the time of year everything that's going on i know it's been rough for everyone with covid life's being totally torn upside down so much suffering we honestly can rest knowing that he's in control and that's where we find our peace so we hope that you guys can do the same thing someone said i assume carlin shops at least once or twice a week lately yes lately yes i feel like when we first got married and even like the start of like the past six months i was like nothing now that christmas is here like i've been shopping all the time your relationship is constantly full of laughing at evan's jokes a lot of the times yes or rolling her eyes yeah but i take either and i run off them like all of those answers fuel me laughter i roll you're so dumb you're you're really stupid all of those fuel me i feel like the vlog actually shows evan's personality more than anything else like because instagram's more like photos and stuff but the vlog is truly like his personality not an assumption but hope you guys see this absolutely love your family and your youtube xxx you guys are so sweet wow i'm getting so many comments like this we appreciate you being here subscribing we've said it before we wouldn't be doing this if it weren't for you guys oh and look at this oh yeah look even my family got laila the shirt it says new new to the cruise so we like to call that the stew crew you guys have been following us along you know i like to consider us the stuart fam you guys are really the stew crew once you hit that subscribe button you're part of the stu crew layla was just born into it so she's already part of the sticker you budget but you also enjoy life evan is such a strong believer in that yes we budget evan keeps up with all of that but we also try to like not be super strict at some points and splurge here and there oh dessert time that's cool okay this is good someone says oh i love apple pie i knew she'd take that one huh my milkshake i put a milkshake in the freezer oh wrinkle get it this is actually true someone says that you have lots of little arguments but you make up really fast after this is very accurate because everybody's always like you never argue like you have a perfect life that's very accurate it's normally small stupid stuff and then we're like and then we're like i'm so sorry i'm so sorry yeah so we're normal so instead carlin is very sensitive emotional young woman especially after having layla i would not say you're insanely emotional if anything i'd say more bipolar and that's no offense evan has said this literally from the day we met and that's no offense it's just a fact i don't think she's very emotional i think sometimes she can change her emotions very fast it's true i don't have an in between i'm either falling like wobble party time yes or like don't worry i'm going to bed i just don't want to have fun right now i don't have an in-between that's definitely me and it can switch like that this is a really good chocolate milkshake surprisingly for just like mcdonald's but i'm about to throw up now i'm getting very full we had a lot of food that you live in nashville tennessee we do not i'm from nashville we thought about living there but i moved here when we got married but who knows the knoxville area never know if we'll move back someone says oh it was carlin's idea to start the youtube channel no that was more mine i actually think siblings brought it up to you i don't remember who brought it up first i know there was just conversations people have said oh y'all should do that since evan likes filming and stuff anyways and i thought about it but it is a hobby of mine so i'm the one that kind of researched all these oh it's all evan i was actually kind of like i don't want to do that it's fun for me but i'm super glad we did now because we have so many memories to look back on and this whole community that we've built it's fun it's like you guys are awesome friends that we don't even know yeah and we pick days like to read through comments and stuff and it's so fun to hear about your lives and what you think and i just like it all right well anyways that was the last question there's a bunch of them maybe we'll get to some later just wanted to say thanks for watching thanks for being a part of this i hope you enjoyed it learn a little more about us maybe next time we will mukbang we can invite somebody to come to it wouldn't that be fun i would actually love that that'd be awesome so subscribe do all the stuff you do because you're awesome ladies behind the camera about to hit record to stop the video she's flapping we love you guys thanks for following along we'll see you next there she went we'll see what is this i think that's rat poop oh it is evie look oh i'm gonna throw up no i'm gonna throw up    what up stew crew what's up as you can tell we're kind of getting in the christmas spirit today where are your ears huh where's your horns what are these where's your hey hey i'm only interested in the cinnamon rolls yeah that's all she's worried about uh so this is like our biggest christmas day of the year and we're going to jump right into it we've thrown ourselves our own little ugly christmas sweater party mine says feeling festive might delete later garland's is uh you know the good old home alone and lights up too hold her so i can put my lights on found it   so we got our christmas breakfast it's real healthy uh about uh what three or four cinnamon rolls a piece leila doesn't have a sweater so she's just yeah she's just our little reindeer all right so we're gonna start with breakfast and then man i don't know we're getting everything done today i think i'm not gonna tell you though it's no fun when we spoil it hmm she look you can see she literally used like half the icing for just her one what am i gonna use it's all about the icing oh it's dripping all right well looks like that's all that's left uh we didn't have enough for that one because carlin piled the icing on hers as you saw but honestly that's good because you know i want to keep it a little healthier um only eat about three of these leave some of those you ate more than three he only had two three and she ate one oh no no you pinched off that one you had two and a half no my last playlist oh this is mine i don't know however many i had i could have had one more and i stopped i'm just maintaining just maintaining all right let's get to it i'm letting carlyn plan today she's like got several things already planned out and i don't even know if i know everything that's going down so she is the ringleader for this one    all right carlin one thing down everything else to go so this is the masterpiece we get to decorate and this is the masterpiece that gets to decorate it i see it let's do the oranges first okay so she's like drying out oranges and putting strength through them or something it's something everybody's doing now i guess yeah and it apparently it makes your house smell really good if you add cinnamon or something i don't know but um yeah nice shout out to michaela for dropping these yeah michaela was at walmart and uh bring his oranges please and she was like okay what about that one over there that i found a better night do that i found a better knife because i think she cut that one i know but i think that's too thin but still i'm impressed that you did that thank you three pans you're up yeah she got that one done this one done this one's almost done we're about to dry out some fruit i'm still not really gathering all this who knew you could make uh ornaments out of fruit i still don't really see how it looks christmasy but i guess we'll find out guys it's gonna be so beautiful all right and then flip them halfway through they go in the oven for like one said 200 for like seven hours the other said 250 for like three or four hours so we're gonna try the 250 one but i also saw something that said parchment paper so i really hope these don't stick why didn't you tell me that i just saw it on the last one i was looking up about cinnamon oh man what if they stick if they stick it's just oranges we just wasted a little bit of money and we'll start back over goodness carla's just jumping the gun she's already decorating stuff what is this i think that's rat poop it is ebby look oh i'm gonna throw up no i'm gonna throw up throwing up just a walk i bet there's a rat in that so as i was trying to say before carlin found rat poop she's jumping the gun she wouldn't even wait on me to get the camera out she's already started she's unloading stuff i'm gonna start on the lights we're gonna get a lot done today    all right i think the lights look pretty good um carl's checking in on her oranges yep oh my goodness it smells like cinnamon you guys all right uh dad's uh breaking for a little lunch a little sammy poo carlin's figuring out how to make like hand print ornaments or something is that what it is something for layla so we're moving to that next don't ask me why uh carlin's doing it on the ground for layla to like get right into it well it's because we're making it with her oh and we're comfortable well that is cute then let's do it ready layla yeah it needs more or something oh that looks a lot better yeah    is that too thick of an ornament it looks pretty thick to me but i don't know much about making ornaments let's just roll it out soon nice i've never used this before it's kind of exciting oh babe this is gonna be so cute these have to be perfect oh this one can be her foot how many are you making her foot her hand and then one of us three all right oh she paints it back up you ready open your hands no open your hands uh you ready ah instinct is to grab carlin's trying it again i told

dark outside we have been waiting for a very long time uh for the ornaments to like dry in the oven it takes hours it's kind of it's fun it's fun uh so we're gonna wrap some gifts right now while we wait on the um fruit to dry and then we'll try and finish the tree i guess it's been a long day but it's been fun all right so we're about to start straight whoa did that change my shirt yes i did because this girl hey has been drying out fruit for like what four days maybe more okay it took a lot longer than pinterest said so we uh stopped the video last time and we're picking it up now we're like four days later y'all so we're about to uh string the fruit on i think they're all done right she burnt some of them i think i have enough no i just realized that i needed to do them in the airfryer not in the oven we did them in our air fryer and it worked a lot better than the oven the oven kind of got them dark so anyways we're going to try and strain the fruit and then put some ornaments on and this uh the rest of this shouldn't take too long right layla no we're almost done oh did you notice something different too oh yeah the couches that love seat that was over there the

guys uh this weekend so so we got a whole bunch fun about to happen so we're gonna take you along hope you guys are having a wonderful christmas i know we're about to whoa whoa this is happening it's a neighborhood look at that line of traffic the traffic i guess we gotta go turn around and get in that line oh my word this is gonna be the funniest thing ever this is gonna take forever but it is gonna be fun okay so we just entered the neighborhood um we got layla up here with us yes it's safe we're literally crawling at one mile an hour so don't worry we're in a neighborhood and this is amazing well first of all you got your grinch's like this house how do you how do you live in a neighborhood like what we're about to show you and you don't decorate anything it's just lit up everywhere oh my word    oh my word there's literally not room for anything else that's like the coolest thing i've ever seen okay we are actually making our way to the end of the neighborhood that was pretty sick what do you think about that so cool i want to live in one of these houses except for the fact that you could never leave yeah that one house i mean there was no room left on the yard or the house i don't think that was amazing maybe we should do that okay we're gonna cut it a little early so we can get layla buckled before we leave the neighborhood but that was pretty cool i'm glad we of course i loved it all right we're back home carlin what's up what are we doing done done done that's what carlin has for us to do next carlin is literally trying to make like a hundred thousand traditions for us to start now that layla's no we just started too late doing all the festive things of christmas so now we're like countdown to getting all the fun things like christmas lights and gingerbread making we didn't do cookies no we haven't done cookies yet that's because we spent like four days drying out oranges that was our cookies so we went to see lights that was really fun and now we're gonna have a little like what gingerbread house was so cute like obsessed with the light yeah she loved it let's hit it liz is trying to say something what what are you saying you got a front and a back and i guess these are the sides and then no that doesn't line up right windows do windows line it up right no these are roofs yeah look at it my front door may or may not have just shattered i can still post a picture from the back door whoa and look my icing just popped out the bag this stuff is cheaply made no my walls are falling in    i just don't like this it's not i'm not having fun    mine won't stick i think the front door messed it up because now it's caving in a house with a carport so you can drive you this is the best day of my life what do you think babe you're not done yet i kind of have to be most other pieces are broken it's not even fun look at this carlin's is actually looking pretty good you're literally quitting i have to look at mine i can't help it now this stayed my doorknob but this fell it's all being junk i'll be honest i thought this was going to be easy i don't know how yours stayed up so well i get oh you glued it to the bottom where did you see that done i didn't it fell the first few times and then i was like oh is that something you're supposed to do i didn't even know that look all right y'all she's getting her last touches on there look at that that is amazing thank you thank you little trees that's technically a star on top the door the wreath i love the icing on the chimney it really makes that look like snow and then mine's gonna be a close second close second door kind of cracked and all that so next year i'm coming back for revenge it's on for next year but anyways it was fun we're gonna be what calling it a night and we're gonna finish our christmas celebration tomorrow night then we'll head to my families for christmas and it's just party after party after party party's happening see you guys tomorrow night for the rest of our quiz okay so this just in a box what's in the box can't tell you okay so big surprise going on carlin and i said we were not doing christmas for each other this year we were only getting for layla but i lied so i ordered something for carlin and shipped it to our neighbor's house she has no earthly idea that i even ordered it and it's been over my neighbors for like a week or two and i'm telling you me and carlin are literally together all the time we have become one we don't know how to do anything else you know what i'm saying so this is literally the first day i've had a chance to grab this package and wrap it and it's literally the day that we're gonna be filming our christmas so couldn't be better timing carlin was running the car through the car wash and doing some things to get ready for uh going to my families for christmas so this is my perfect chance i don't know how long i'll have but i'm going to try and wrap this i'm not going to tell you what it is inside this box right here is carlin's dream christmas gift given by her dream husband all right so both packages are now covered up to where she walked up to the door i don't think she could see so i can breathe a little bit should i just hide them under the tree and see if she ever notices i don't know we'll figure that out see you in a bit what did you just ask me carlin so it is true you you even tried to i did everything i could and this is actually very upsetting like i'm not even just joking i'm actually really annoyed right now because somehow she found this that's because i came in here no you had the dive wipes like that and i was like my house is always always organized yeah oh just because the diaper wipes were slightly moved you knew i literally knew it was like here i slid i slid her gifts under there and hid them with diaper wipes this is very upsetting no christmas you promised me no christmas for each other for each other we're not i'm just doing it for you that's not for each other did you make me look like a bad wife no that was our plan i'm taking them back now you did a good job thanks i thought i did thanks i appreciate it so we're just going to get up in the morning and do christmas instead of doing it tonight so thanks for ruining the surprise we'll see you guys in the morning you and here we are merry christmas so it's the next morning uh we're about to open gifts we're about to have this our christmas first christmas are you excited are you excited yeah you are you're gonna get some gifts all right so i don't know i'm stoked i love christmas too and i'm not even a weedle kid anymore so daddy's gonna read the christmas story before we open presents okay so we always read the christmas story uh like with my family at christmas and everything of course um but for layla we got her like a child's book to kind of put it on more of a kid level so we're excited and yes we're sitting on a beautiful couch right now our new couch came in comfortable we're just showing you bits and pieces so we can do like the big reveal yeah we'll talk about that more later here we go the christmas promise long long ago god promised to send a very special king would you like to know how he did it the christmas story starts with an angel the angel told mary you will have a very special baby you want to see it mary and joseph went to bethlehem god sent more angels to see some shepherds whoosh far far away some wise men saw a new star in the sky whoosh why does it say god sent his king just as promised and his name is jesus baby jesus came to the world he was just like you he was little baby yeah baby except he was perfect but you are pretty close hey are you ready open it are you so excited you open it for your point time out time out this is her first christmas yeah this is your first like this is like big memories oh no not that no no we didn't get you the papers that would have been ready    do you love that say thank you thank you shout out to mom for picking out most of these gifts open it her face did you see that she was like you can stack them all up is that cool you have one more read this other book for you because we know that you love books and you're probably really getting bored of reading the same books every day yeah time running around keeping people pleased but this is my favorite holiday it's a chance to start over new cause i missed you so i'm letting go of everything but you these are the good times with you baby this year it's just gonna be you and me    well i don't know about you but there's just something special about giving them gifts we didn't go overboard um because she's 10 months old so we kind of just got her some gifts she can play with and maybe things that will help her learn it's cool to like see christmas through like a child's eyes just watching her play with them and opening them like she doesn't show a ton of emotion but you could just tell a whole new perspective it's so sweet but truly the greatest gift of all is god sending his son as a baby it's not about the gifts it's not about the fun it's not about the lights we wouldn't have any of it if it weren't for christ he's the true meaning of the season okay can i open my again oh would you look at who's worried about themselves uh i think got me guess even though we both agreed that we were not gonna get each other again well last night yeah they know believe me i already showed them and i found two boxes sitting under layla's dress so obviously he did give me something what did you just ask me carlin so it is true you you emmy tried to i did everything i could and this is actually very upsetting like i'm not even just joking i'm actually really annoyed right now i slept i slid her gifts under there and hid them with diaper wipes this is very upsetting no christmas you promised me no christmas for each other for each other we're not i'm just doing it for you that's not for each other no that was our plan well here's the thing i think to punish her i think what we're gonna do here's what we're gonna do she's not gonna get to open them now we're gonna take them with us to my families and she's gonna open them on christmas day not fair that's what i think no way i think so no i think it's just a slight punishment for being snoopy i did not find it he left something unorganized so therefore his fault give me that strainer give me your insulin it wasn't my fault i was very excited for my christmas i literally slept thinking what did he give me one time all night long i couldn't even sleep last night and didn't fall asleep till like 3am okay well don't get your hopes up it's not much but here's the thing you tell me you want to open it now or you want to wait till christmas she wasn't supposed to say that it's happening okay fine so i'm caving thought i was going to make her wait but i just can't i'm excited so here it goes two peasants she's like a kid in a candy store right now or i guess i should just say a kid on christmas morning okay what should i open first probably the big one really yeah okay go no guesses no guesses laila do you want to watch mommy open your budget fine    this is not a little gift i just can't i just i just can't believe you did this you never surprised me i literally said like so many times this is like my dream gift she's been begging for a camera i mean you literally like all right open it you're going way too slow you're getting me anxious it's because i can't even believe it i cannot even believe it it's like you never surprised me like this ever like i'm like shocked i'm trying not that i'm glad you like it thank you you're the best christmas of my whole winter why it's my favorite christmas ever i promise how do you know because you said you wanted one i know but how'd you do it we promised we weren't doing christmas i'm such a lame-o i lied you did lie you should have at least given me a heads up couldn't hey babe we're doing christmas couldn't do that that's okay i'm gonna save your christmas for your family's house oh yeah my christmas so is she gonna have time to go pick something up no no it's very thought out oh i just can't tell you because i don't want you to ruin this right right yeah that makes sense thank you you're welcome all right we're gonna get out of here i don't think there's any other surprises we got out here so i think we're going to end it right here are you talking about for you no i was just i wasn't meaning that that way i was just saying i really wasn't meaning it that way i don't know why you got anything to say it's my favorite christmas of my entire life because i have the best husband you're sweet i'm glad you like it how am i gonna learn how to

buying a new one lies you tell them the truth right now tell them okay we went out of town for christmas so i turned off the heat to save money uh i didn't realize that that could be very bad for like your house and your pipes also it kills the plants inside so this one's on me so we're buying some more plants no we're not buying plants okay well maybe two yeah i figured if we're gonna replace the

always say see you next week i wanted to just be like but it is see you next week i know i know people have wanted to know this what what was the name of the guy that you dated before me    foreign what up stu crew uh we got something going on today that is super duper fun i'm stoked i'm excited are you excited are you excited look at you go tell them what we're doing carlin i did not choose this first of all do i feed my teeth we just ate we had petros it's like a chili place uh so my stomach's very full more than likely we're going to be vomiting throwing up whatever's the most appropriate term to use so we're gonna do the uh thing spill your guts or fill your gut ah evan just got home it's a liquid edition so no nasty foods just nasty liquids we got some hot sauce apple cider vinegar uh i don't know do these have juice in them something you can drink i don't know we're gonna find out this is good stuff it's uh it's just sparkling grape juice sparkling cider this is tuna i know tuna has juice inside i think that's going to be nasty i don't eat food that's right you're not going to eat it you're going to drink it sparkling cider and the dr pepper are two good ones we're going to probably make like what 10. that's all we're doing are we doing these are like if you draw the number or something you get a little reward it's not nasty i don't know we may not even do that we'll see are we doing more oh yeah we got we're going to get several um what else we got in here it's kind of running low is the milk bad we could do spoiled milk 12 30. today's the fifth did you explain how the game works so do they know how the game works i think so but hang on i'm getting chilly out of areas i think i just did didn't i i don't remember what all i said spill your guts or fill your guts you ask each other questions like i'm gonna ask carlin something like uh who's your favorite evan or layla oh she can't answer that so if she answers she doesn't have to drink the stuff if she says oh i can't answer that then she has to drink one of the nasty things i'm picky this is not gonna go over well for me no it's not and that's what's gonna make it funny    this thing's stupid here you go take the camera take the camera been waiting for a day like today stop it go    i have been doing push-ups since new year's eve night thanks for noticing i got to keep it pushed up against my body because it makes it look bigger    all right you didn't do it it was uh just a test american ninja warrior    vehicles ain't standing a chance against me what's up this is pickle juice nine is breast milk uh eight is the tuna seven is the hot sauce oh that's bad that's i i will say that's disgusting six is the sparkling cider so that is the one good one we didn't even put the dr pepper in here so this is the only one that's like a wild card we're drawing the numbers out of a deck of cards so even when we don't want to answer a question we don't know what number we're gonna get five is no five's hot sauce what was this did you do two hot sauces no it was that juicy stuff oh one of them's the vienna sausages one of them is the vienna sausages four is some italian dressing which just that is disgusting three is oh apple cider vinegar that about made me want to throw up just smelling it two is steak seasoning like a liquid almost like a one sauce some steak seasoning they have that's gonna make us that'll probably kill it and then one is is this lemon lemon juice yeah it doesn't even smell like lemon juice so we can't take credit for this either we saw this on a few other uh vlogs oh yeah several people have done that's where we got the idea to do this so it was a dumb idea what is the most you have ever weighed oh i'll tell you that it was when i was pregnant you'll tell me that well i there i just lost the question i didn't girls don't like to share the weight from what i heard how much should i weigh with her i think 134. that's not bad at all but i did not think she'd want to share it i don't care i think that's right that's the problem with carlyn she actually doesn't mind saying something so it's gonna be hard for me then eat it man i'll tell you my whole life okay go carlyn it's your turn then oh great she's got them written out i'm not prepared i don't know what questions she won't want to answer rank your brother-in-law's from least to most favorites you know i can't do that you have to do that or you have to pick i only have two brother-in-laws dan randolph and daniel sparks and then all of my family well goodness that would take me 30 minutes just to put them in an order sorry that was the question either way i wouldn't go so let me pick a card i love this oh number four okay salad dressing it's gonna be nasty but not as bad as somebody else like a mouthful sure whoa whoa you have to say something for me just in case i get it it's that sick this is the best oh and also i'm like losing my voice guys the weather here is like up and down it's crazy so that's why i sound like a man it was good i'm actually not kidding you that's probably the worst thing on the on the table because it's just so weird tasting without salad my sister kalyn helped me come up with some rank the five oldest uh duggar girls from least favorite to most favorite you're literally doing a no no it's not copying i was saving these till later on in the game but you started out strong so i'm getting back right to it oh that is so not fair i'm not gonna do that i thought you said i'll do it i don't want you to eat any of this favorite yeah the top five who you least like to who you most like i can't i can't say that because i love them all oh i was hoping you would say that stinks doesn't it this is wrong please lord help her not to get number six that's the only good one out there take a card please take a card it's fine oh that's the hot sauce or either the vienna sausages hot and spicy juice that's not fair you know i can't answer that you knew i couldn't answer brother-in-law's how could i do that i can't even hardly name them all you might spit it out i hate hot things go go did you even get any hot sauce is not hot that may have been the vienna sausage juice oh good point it's hard to tell did you ever practice kissing in a mirror before we got married oh for sure you're gonna see layla just pop in and out of these videos because we set her down then she wants back up and so that's how it's gonna go i know i know people have wanted to know this what what was the name of the guy that you dated before me oh what is that oh no two the steak seasoning why am i getting stuck we can't draw this out we just gotta go just down it and go here i'll get the trash can here i'm gonna get a drink you're making me thirsty oh that was that was sick that was a good one okay who are you most embarrassed about that you crushed on you have to say a name how does she have so many good ones i'm sitting here trying to think of even a question to ask her i'm like if you had to pick your favorite brand of toothpaste whose would you pick who i'm embarrassed by so like i'm like did you like it so i'm almost like oh i wish i never liked you yeah wow because most of the girls that i grew up with like at church go to your church still and you see them every time well or possibly could even see this come on we know i can't hurt people's feelings yeah i don't like that i'm not that kind of guy seven oh good oh no i think this is the hot sauce i think this is the hot sauce good oh i missed it i missed you doing it that's funny you did it is it hot is that the hot sauce see i knew i drank the wrong one oh you would have died i would have died i would have i would have died she would have died all right it made me gag halfway down go ask anyone rank your favorite creatures from favorite to least favorite of these three we have our pastor justin pratt we have kenny baldwin and we have scott paulie okay whoa that was quick she grew up knowing all these guys right yeah so i would rank uh justin pratt as what least your favorite okay for sure scott polly and then kenny bottle okay wow kind of surprised she threw that out there but they're all really good i was going to say you better end that with their home they're all really good good preachers but of course our pastor has a special place right right okay all right cool cool my turn go did you like any of my sisters before me and who okay so we broke the news that some people had tried to set me up with you're gonna say it one of her sisters before her and granted i was 16 she was 13 you know when we like first met so that's understandable and i talked to some of her family as friends and stuff nothing serious but um i don't think we ever said who oh no oh pickle juice oh yeah yeah it's not too bad still annoying it still makes me tingle at the end for the next baby do you want it to be a boy or a girl oh man that's so wrong i know because maybe down the road baby number two lord willing watching this video what if it's not what you say in this video hurt feelings i think you just better go ahead no it's almost like i would want i would want a girl for the sake of like her to be like best friends with layla so should have a sister buddy but then on the other hand like brother sister combo would be like so cute oh i don't know fine i don't know six what's six the sparkling grape juice praise jesus cause i should not have been judged for like not having a preference i guess the lord was worth i guess the lord was looking out for you delicious if you could have a free punch to someone's face who would it be that is actually a good one i love this game wow i'll admit carlos ah can't do it i can't say that three i don't know what that is it looks like you know what though red muffins that's apple cider vinegar now i kind of really want to know all these questions does this make y'all curious i about threw up that time though who do you want to put in the face right now right now maybe you for making me drink that okay what's the worst gift that you've ever received from me okay this is not a bad answer okay i've got hiccups or something after drinking all this stuff i would have to say the worst gift she's given and this is good this is an honest answer and i would not deny it all right the worst gift she's ever given me possibly could have been the best she tried to be super sweet super sentimental and i loved it so for those of you that don't know i like to do magic card tricks that was the worst gift i put a lot of i know but i'll tell you why carlin went through on a deck of cards for every single card printed a picture on the back and wrote a message on each card i'm talking most sentimental most amazing gifts that i wish i could have kept do you not remember what happened she had glued them in the car on the way to my house and they all got stuck together this is so bad it was supposed to be one of those is like a book i think you had like a tie through it so when we flipped through it they were literally ripping the pictures and the words off of these that was the worst gift ever even though it would have been the most sentimental a picture on the back of us and then a memory written that would have taken hours i don't see how you even did it right too and they were but when she stuck them together them out of the gift and like they i don't even know if we have them anymore we probably don't really i don't remember what's the rudest prank you've ever pulled on someone it was actually the dean of men at my school yeah so that's just good family came over and we're gonna pull a prank on them well everybody kind of like sits down in three three chairs and there's a leader and it's like copy the leader you know hit your stick do this and then the leader stands up they stand up well then you're supposed to put like an egg in their seat well i couldn't find an egg we were out of eggs so i squirted like a ton of mayonnaise on the dean of men's chair at our school is very embarrassing because i didn't know that mayonnaise like stained khaki it like ruined his suit it was khaki bean yeah whatever it was yeah i felt really bad after the fact because i didn't know that it like stained it okay all right favorite parent that's so not fair fine nine you gotta drink your own breast milk i can't do that sorry go ahead i kind of want to try i'm just going to go ahead okay kind of doesn't really like taste like tastes sweet i feel like nothing else it's probably sweeter than regular milk i eat a lot of sugar apparently i can put that in my cereal really what's your most embarrassing moment i think i know what it would be i don't know if i should share that for some reason he was so extremely embarrassed about this it took him forever to tell me and we were like engaged i don't know thank you are you really going to draw a card for that come on draw it then it's an ace which is a one drink that's what you do i think that's lemon juice that's not fair you're going to give me the tuna whoa that is insanely sour though all right my question possibly the last question of the night for tuna water read us off your highest day of screen time no that's not fair because this is like my job though i do work on my phone i agree she does a lot of work on your phone a ton of work on my phone like with the boutique nope that's it tell us    whatever tune of water the one thing she said she did not want chug it chug it chug it chug it i can't i'm literally gonna throw this up no you have to try and swallow it yeah like we have the whole time it stinks was it that bad your eyes are watering that was probably the nastiest thing i hate this so much that was a good way to end it well this was fun our first little uh challenge question type video we've kind of done like this it's still in my mouth thanks for watching guys we love you remember to hit that subscribe button turn on the bell so you'll be notified when we post and i think we're going to get out of here see you next week her birthday life's getting a little too easy right now we're looking for something to make it a lot harder and a lot more difficult    evan what's wrong carlin broke my hand i did not i did not break your hand she did don't let her trick you y'all it actually is pretty bad can they see it yeah go under the light here i'll move i barely feel like it but i'll move for you he's such a guy it actually is really bad babe we should actually go get it checked out chillin why don't you tell them what happened faintish tell me what happened now it does hurt though so here's i'll give you a little replay it actually does really hurt i've been editing for one of our vlogs and carl was like here can you take leila real quick she was going to do something i was like well i'm editing i don't know if i can right now and we were kind of playing a little like laugh session she was like trying to step on my feet to keep me from going we were having fun we were being cute it was fun and so she was like stepping on my feet and i was trying to get away like this yeah right everyone's running try to run around her i don't know if she kind of bumped me or i slipped i don't know but i fell as you can see i crushed this basket and then i landed on something and i don't it was so funny i wish i could have slow-mo down but i mean i've gained back a little bit of weight about 157 pounds coming down onto some what it may be one of these sharp toys i don't know whatever it is nailed and it really hurts right and then he laid right there i'll show him i was like it was it was i don't want to put my hand down it honestly hurts that man it was boom and then i was like pretty much like that laila is your daddy crazy do you feel bad for daddy i was neglecting my fatherly duties yeah he was the one running and i didn't mean to oh you tripped but it was very funny but i didn't know it was this bad now i actually like feel bad about it so should we go check it out no it's okay stop no it actually does really hurt but of course i'm just being funny all right i guess we can get on with the rest of the vlog somebody's a cutie i'm gonna get you i will get you checking in with you guys about my hand with the several days of relaxation and carlin massaging it it's looking better feeling better but uh still don't think it's back to 100 pretty rough injury hopefully one i'll recover from on the road to recovery right baby guys overreact anyways carlin has something special planned for us i feel like my hair looks a little messy i feel like my hair looks a little messy but i don't know guys can get away with it sometimes ready messy look hey long story short we're going to stay in pigeon forge it's like kind of close to us for one night just because like it's been crazy so layla is turning one this month like that's insane how has the year already passed we just almost want to like regroup have a night refocus 2021 spend some things focus on quality time with layla before she turns one that's it pretty much he's so sad that you can't put them in the bag i got your pjs in there don't worry i need uh my vitamins i need her toothbrush and toothpaste okay so the last time we mentioned kara you guys really seem to like it we've been taking it for a few months now you know just starting 20 21 off right you know taking the small wins where we can get it doing what we can to benefit our health it's important you guys should do it too we want you guys to stick around for a long time be healthy if you didn't i'd have no one to make videos for you know what i'm saying honestly i'll tell you my favorite part has my name on it oh i'm a sucker for that you saw the last video with our robe my monogrammed robe you know i'm kind of a sucker for my name on things are we out of diapers because i don't think we have diapers yeah thank you mentioned something about that the other day we probably should get some not to stop and get some of those cute little please how cute it is from granny oh thank you hey we don't need this many though you just need to oh are you letting me stay that long are we having that well that's kind of what i figured carlin would get there and be like maybe we should stay a second night so no i'm not there you go ah these are perfect i love that i don't have to pack like nine different bottles of vitamins i can pack just these little we pack enough as it is for three people we always pack a ton i always overpower layla it's crazy love these things uh because they're super personalized you just tell them online like what you want to work on like i need sleep or i need this and they tell you what vitamins you need for that i took the quiz just the other day you go to their website carlin sent it to me at work it took me like five minutes don't tell my boss did it work and it was super easy says i need more fish in my life so i got fish oil this time you excited about your official kinda you're so cute our code is reactivated with them it's stuart fam 50 if you want to check it out evan will put it in the description again like last time oh it's okay    did you hear that you said mama on camera for the first time she did i heard it i don't want to admit it but i heard it now that was pretty cute that's so sweet she's almost one and she said mama that was cute yeah carlin's trying not to freak out cause leila is saying mama right now and then here mama she doesn't do it on command she only does it when she's whining like when she's whining she really wants me she goes mama but when i ask her to say it like say mama she doesn't grasp that yet do it mama loves her baby so when you get on the road so you can fall asleep good morning so where are we taking you today guess where we're going thank you we could take you to the zoo we're gonna go see some animals like a draft in a monkey you've never seen one have you so we're just enjoying the hotel got a shower put my robe on so weird you packed your own yeah carlin was like are you really gonna bring your robe i was like why would i not bring my robe leila    coming in beside him that's crazy it is a little chilly out but uh we've got her warm clothes so i think we'll be fine we're gonna head to the zoo let her see some animals and it should be a fun day this has been a fun little trip kind of for us kind of for laylah's little birthday oh look you excited you know your birthday's going out it's almost your birthday birthday she's in such a good birthday girl all right guys what's up uh so we made it to the zoo we actually didn't go to the knoxville zoo we found a zoo where they actually take in rescue animals so we were like that's something we'd love to support that's super cool also like it's not gonna be like overcrowded it's actually nice so leila can get up close to the animals she's already looking around like and it's almost closing time for them so like nobody's out here so we're kind of keeping our mask just chilling yeah and if we come in contact with someone we'll put them up whoa whoa the lion that's a tiger a tiger    it's a monkey say hi whoa okay did that scare you oh he's looking at me he's trying to call me out come on bro come on sizing me up okay that's actually creepy this must be a vicious monkey nice move you might have them fooled might have everybody else fooled not me i'm not biting off night museum that's funny    hello testing we're back home did you have fun did you have so much fun did you love those animals tell them how much you love the animals oh that much so we're in the living room discussing we just got home and we're trying to unpack stuff but we're in the living room discussing layla's birthday and like birthday plans and what we're gonna do because i mean this is our only child and she's turning one and this is such a big deal you don't have to lay it on thick okay i'm not i'm just saying carlin wants me to get laila a dog for her birthday a puppy only because she loves loves dogs i will say i will say when you see their faces light up like even today at the zoo she was like come here come here and then she just smiled and like trying to get it because she wanted to touch him so bad and at the zoos it's hard because you can't really touch them yeah she was loving it i'll admit layla is super cute with animals my mom and dad have a little dog and she loves it chases it around so we've been kind of talking about it for a while i was not totally sold on it but even carlin honestly wasn't i mean i know that it's a lot of work but there's sacrifices you make for your child's happiness here's what i say we're in our rental right now so we don't even know like if we would be allowed to have it before right that's why i say we just like ask our landlord hey is this even a possibility and then we kind of just leave it in his hands if he says no so it's like throwing the fleece out like that story in the bible we're gonna pray and just say lord let our landlord make a decision for us whatever yeah then it makes it easier and then if he says yes then we say okay let's start looking for one i don't know if we have time to get it before her birthday now but it can be like a little late present okay and then if he says no then it's just like okay she'll just have we'll just get her more toys do anything plus i'm gonna love watching you train potty train the dog i'm gonna love watching you potty train the dog i know i've already been googling i'm going to be at work it's actually going to be mostly unique it says you have to take it out every 20 minutes that's what i've heard you got to like be faithful with it it's like having a newborn waking up and feeding it it'll probably be more work than a nipple really i don't know all right so here's the thing i don't know i'm i will give the green light from my end are you ready to say so for the landlord and everything i grew up with dogs i like dogs um i do know i do know that they can be a lot of work though especially training it to not go in the house and you know just to be obedient and good i just think right now we don't have a newborn layla is almost a year it's like the perfect yeah life's getting a little too easy right now we're looking for something to make it a lot harder and a lot more difficult i love you all right so we've kind of come to the decision we're gonna talk to our landlord about it if we get the green light from him we're possibly moving forward to getting a dog we're crazy maybe we should back out maybe not i don't know all right guys i think we're going to end it here we'll keep you updated on that situation in the future we'll see how that goes but it was fun layla was so cute today we're excited about her turning one in like what a few weeks couple weeks i can't believe we're about to have a one-year-old it's crazy we love you guys thanks for watching and we'll see you next week the question is before you lock the door should i tell you what you're missing or should we just go without it all right    what's up stu guru okay i don't know if this is going to go at the beginning of a vlog middle of a vlog end of a vlog i don't know we're just vlogging it layla's trying to stand guys you stood up for a long time can get it oh man good job baby   all right here you go you want your weirdo wait don't move oh she's been doing it over and over this is her first time to actually start sitting she stood for like 5 to 10 seconds probably longer about 10 at least very next evening i might cry you guys are gonna think we're making this up in the same video we are she's just getting smart all at once layla is saying daddy what what dad dad i get so excited every time i go to talk i interrupt her from saying it say dad dad you wanna come see daddy i love you one thing she does for me and not carlin is she's saying that out on cue it looks like mama daddy she's saying dada on cue and not modeling you and cousins still say mama first yeah but she only says mama when she whines she says dad out on cue watch this say dada   i love you take this i gotta hold her i love you it's so cute oh my goodness is this daddy your daddy dad that one was so plain yeah she's done they're gonna think i'll wear this sherpa like every single day she does i basically do every vlog i'm in his sherpa she's washed it i'm sure but it's so comfy she has been wearing it but i wear this no i don't i never wear this i look good tonight the very next evening our child does nothing but say dad dad all day long if you can't tell carl's pretty jealous about it uh can't say that i blame her though i mean it's pretty obvious layla loves me more um i'm definitely her favorite she says dada nonstop she says mama when she wants something sometimes but she says dada she'll just be playing with toys saying that uh-oh mama what what was that dada she'll say mama every once in a while again right stop gloating i do way more for her so really in the end she loves me the most yeah she's with me 24 7. i do all of it i know but if i was the one with her 24 7 then she'd for sure love me even more like wouldn't be a contest then you couldn't handle her 24 7. you wouldn't know the first thing about packing a diaper bag feeding her changing her diapers her when she's mad and sad and hungry and tired say it would be easy because she would just say dada all day long fine you think that you can do that i say oh that would be so easy she just said we should make this vlog where i do everything for layla for 24 hours so easy look at her she's not crazy what was that music to my ears listen all right fine no there i don't even need information i don't need help you know we'll start it right now we'll start it right now fine 24 hours it's 708 i'll even round up to 7 10. 7 10 to 7 10 tomorrow night and i'm not we got church all day tomorrow so the challenge is i watch layla for 24 hours that's easy enough all i know is i'm gonna have such an easy day tomorrow i cannot wait for sleeping the peace and quiet the nap time i'm gonna take we will probably have to get up earlier tomorrow i don't have to eat up early um evan you're doing a really great job your child has a diaper what and everything's emptied out of the bathroom cabinet layla we had a deal you be good while i'm on watch mom was getting work stuff done and um give me a kiss so i love you see she doesn't give you kisses like that you gave me the wipes that means i gotta carry you in there to get the wipes where are the stinking wipes we'll just get them out of the diaper bag mom always tells me not to get the wipes out of the diaper bag because they won't be there when we travel but she doesn't realize that she's pretty much got everything i need right there you go change her diaper so evan thinks that he has everything figured out about this whole thing he's complaining about the poop diaper but he's right i'm making it too easy because my diaper bag is completely packed already for church tomorrow so i'm gonna make it hard on them i'm gonna unpack everything like like everything this is gonna be so bad the spare outfits bye    okay now let's see how good he thinks he has it together tomorrow when he has to get the diaper back if he even remembers to get a diaper bag i need some pajamas for her we'll just put you in nothing in there that's a sleeper all right let's read your book which one you want to read the first one on top mommy and me tonight it's gonna be daddy and me okay we can change that good good good good good good i think i did that right 3 28 a.m    why is she awake i don't know she's hungry that's what kids do i guess listen tonight just let me feed her and then we'll put it no that's part of the job i'm gonna do this all the way through i don't think she likes a bottle we don't normally do a bottle just get me here i'm going to nurse her let me just try it come on take it baby just take it i'm just gonna talk the only thing carlin's doing and that's just because it's for the good of our baby is somebody getting up so daddy got his shower got his robe on obviously and uh he's gonna get ready for church don't get related ready for jerk say this is easy okay what is a church outfit ah now we're cooking oh that's cute and that's like a sleeper i think she's actually worn that before and it's like a one piece but it's fancy enough to look like it goes to church i think i just found my easy way out what do you think yeah yep she's worn it before i know she has she wore it last service that's not my fault this is super chill super easy i'm great at this say hi say hi oh great i gotta change the diaper too stinky carlin what where's all the stuff that was in the diaper bag um you said you could do everything you are rude better hurry we're gonna be late you have a twisted mind the thing is though carlin if you're hiding wipes and stuff from me that's not right i'm not i will say this outfit's weird i guess everything goes on at the neck there's no buttons look at you beautiful oh sure oh no oh no i just put it on backwards don't tell carlin this will be our little secret all right let's change it around i'm sorry layla i'm sorry her snacks you took all our snacks out of the bag and they're not anywhere in here uh that's because this is where the snacks go i also looked in the kitchen and they weren't anywhere in there got an extra pair of shoes an extra outfit just in case she leaks out her cup food in case she gets hungry and then i didn't see her little puppy puffs you're pretty good babe i just don't know where you keep her puffy clothes i'm actually impressed with how much you got going on thanks you even got an extra outfit yeah cause sometimes they leak out wow ah i already looked in here do you have everything you need i think so and maybe while i'm at it i can teach her to say mom for you like more consistently like she does dad i'll work on it while i'm dealing with her why am i filming you drink coffee and the coffee's cold now i just worked so long so hard i just want to sit down and enjoy a hot cup of coffee sometimes all moms say that i've been wanting to say that there's mom's phone i'm totally going to be late the challenge was not be on time to church challenge now actually we're going early for choir practice so we probably will be a little late to that choir director we apologize we tried evan was getting level ready this morning the question is before you lock the door should i tell you what you're missing or should we just go without it all right hey wait i dropped the diaper bag that's what it was i put my coat on and i dropped the diaper bag thanks for uh you didn't remind me it's okay yes i did remind you well i'm on baby duty nursery was not open yet uh there's choir practice going on so i'm watching layla so hey this is jonathan this is our buddy from church i've been taking leila to the nursery look at you man you're cool this is the queen nursery worker ever for 24 hours yeah he's watching her fully by himself and he almost forgot the diaper bag this morning i love him evan has 24 hours pretty good so far not in my mind hey no not my number it's your number today come on just got home from church a couple minutes ago changed getting our comfy clothes ready for sunday afternoon nappy i am going to go take a nap this is going to be so nice that i get me too no she's not gonna sleep she already took her nap on the way home she's alive and well she wants to play and then also i figured like while i'm sleeping you could do like the other motherly duties that i do like around the house oh but i'm a firm believer of it's not just the wife's duties to clean the house so therefore today it's not just hey this is what i would be doing anyways on a normal day when i'm at work so i love you so much i love you but i love to get a good night's sleep okay before we uh get to cleaning i think carla wants me to get the full experience uh she said we need some things from walmart you wanna go to the store we're    here well that was definitely interesting shopping by yourself with a baby okay we made it back wasn't that bad honestly layla was a very sweet little girl just sit in her car seat the whole time uh we're gonna go and see if carlin is up or asleep i don't know what's going on and i guess we're gonna get to clean in the house right layla you gonna help me clean let's not wake up mama okay yeah she's still asleep so let's get you out of there and we'll clean up    um      swallow what you got first is it all done ah all done okay okay i'm gonna give you some do you want some    okay we decided we're gonna go wake mama it's almost time to leave for choir practice open the door yeah take a look around if you want i'm so impressed you should be on mom duty all the time did you go to walmart yeah daddy's the best is he the best stop it well this was the funnest thing we've ever done can we do this again routine well we're not done once a week i got till 7 30 tonight oh wow this is great we're gonna head to church yeah i've ever had in my life we're gonna head to church soon we got choir practice pretty early at 4 30. probably won't even film anything there because honestly praise the lord for nursery workers they watch their deer in church this morning they'll watch her tonight so really i think it's a

tired we're breathing better though obviously in colorado we're at a lot higher of an altitude and my head was hurting like every day uh you could tell like it was a lot harder to breathe it was crazy

exciting is going on today i'm not even yeah aren't you excited i'm pretty excited lately are you excited so she's been eating a donut okay cool so let me give you the rundown first yeah a few days ago i went and did a revamp oh my god cut it a little bit shorter and a little more blonde super cute i love it yeah he's so sweet when i was there i was talking about our dog our puppy and i was so excited about it and she was like girl have you got it trained you have to meet this dog trainer he's the best ever and we're like if we're gonna have more kids and like even with layla being small we want to actually be able to enjoy her yeah and like cuddle and and not her chewing all over leland knocking her down so long story short voila this guy's coming today he's hooking us up he just pulled up oh he just pulled up he just pulled up this guy's legit this dog better get excited look at my three girls what's up man good how are you not to mention he's a beast like this guy's huge i need to get workout tips from him too y'all look she's already like she's just sitting there what is it welcome what's her name we went for izzy and roo and we just put them together so is he rude now give me the name of your business again it's canine services unlimited students canine services all right so you heard it here go check out k9 services unlimited put it in the description get ready to watch the magic yeah no joke magic happens look she's already acting so different she really is i'm not kidding normally she was running around and since he walked in she's just been sitting there all right you tell us what we need to do what's our first steps what happened yep well what i got to do is first walk you through how this operating system this little furry fuzzy adorable operating system functions all right so we're gonna get into the story he's gonna talk us through a lot of it before we actually get into the training part maybe you guys can get some tips from it yeah no joke i'm excited i'm actually gonna give you the whole story behind dog training and okay everybody you and everybody listening can put me out of business i'm gonna give you the secrets right okay awesome every single behavior dog does and what she's doing right now is a behavior like she's looking around maybe for low-lying fruit that the baby dropped she's looking for maybe crumbs or snacks or things that she can get freebies but every single behavior a dog does 24 7 has a purpose okay and that purpose is to satisfy their needs and instincts and when you understand what a dog's needs are you can identify what she's trying to do and why she's trying to do it and either you reward and reinforce what she's doing because it's a behavior that you like or you interrupt it or redirect it or just not allow her to engage like right now she's over there sniffing and chewing yeah she may grab the wire or that cord right she had she did kind of chew up my computer charger cord already so that's why it's cool right so once you understand she's circling quite a bit by that back door so yeah if it's potty time or probably i should probably take it around yeah hurry oh uh yeah too late we missed it oh there's a little wetness right there pretty sure we missed it evan well let's take her out anyways right probably right absolutely yeah yeah absolutely he says take her out okay i think we may have missed the timing yeah pretty sure we missed this guys there's a golden opportunity we missed right there and he knew exactly what was happening well that's my fault because i saw it and i said i was a little bit trying to finish wow how did we not know that this is not a movement even though he just got here now let's see what happens now that's a very common thing folks say go potty go potty potty what you do now is nothing really very easy job you ignore her she's gotta maybe her special place she likes to get a longer leash dog ownership is like being bipolar outside you ignore her and when she finally goes just as she finishes going number one or number two you become a cheerleader what a good girl okay i don't like using treats because if they smell the treats on you they forget about potty and they try to get the treats oh okay physical and verbal praise is enough to acknowledge the behavior this guy's a genius it's really not i love it so we use a clicker right yeah she doesn't come flying over here she has no idea what this means because there's no value connected to it yeah and keep this out of her hands because she'll make you nuts with it yeah yeah yeah the very first session that we'll do and i'll go get my food pouch out and we'll start it really is i'm a retired cop too so i've been training dogs about 30 years thank you for your service that's awesome appreciate it i always work 50 hours a week i love it but i always have four or five dogs to train when i got home like i never almost never slept all right i love it yeah let's check it out go grab a couch where do you want to do it at whatever you think is a little yeah it's like a little bit smaller sounds good let's do it take her rations mm-hmm yeah look at that she smells it right look at that she's looking for the low-lying fruit so i just put my nose my hand to her nose you see the tail going yeah and now she's eating a piece i don't click it i want to make sure she's about it right make sure she wants to eat and i move backwards that draws her to me right but i offer okay so now she's eating as she's eating i move away from her what does that do draws her to me that's awesome this is the fun stuff right there that's so cool wow what do you think about that what are you thinking about this is so    cool yeah all right well we're gonna head out of this segment we appreciate our man like i said all his information's in the description check it out we know it's gonna work and you'll want to try him out we'll keep you updated on the progress of what happens and then also when he goes in like more in-depth training that's right i know you guys are gonna love it six hours later look at that wow it is already working i'm a dog mom show them all right watch it i missed it a little bit don't worry dogs look it up this is like kind of a more raw type food we're using so karlin said she was not gonna stick her hand inside of it nope so hopefully this is still okay she's clicking and then giving it like a bite or two and uh literally like that guy said like she's all this is just tonight this is just the next time and she's just been sitting there when she gets done with the bike waiting on more carlyn's doing good she looks professional with that little clicker what's this oh look she is she's doing it he said do not go to them he said you wait for them to come to you that's forgot i forgot i'll just sit right here look at that okay it is already being so good click and drop no fight sizes man i'm a pro this is so cool we have a good dog it's a great dog wow great dog yeah i actually am excited i'm not kidding because i've always said if i have my own dog at my own house i want it to be very well trained and and then it is your best friend i mean you don't have a best friend in life that just ignores you doesn't ever do what you want to do no that's not how friends work but a best friend does the stuff you like you throw a ball to your best friend they throw it back kind of a dog that's what i'm looking for fetch with me and all that kind of stuff    wow carlin is even fighting through the distraction of a phone call sorry katie she'll call you right back i love you making me do it but wow maybe carlyn's in training right here too and it didn't faze hey i want to show you my doll watch this one day of training and watching look she's he said you click and then give it a bite and wait for it to come back and she is literally just sitting there after each week we had a dog training session today well okay now he said you do not go to it you wait for it to come back i know he said it may be done    no i think it was just sitting i think not evan i think it's just come running she's cleaning out the bowl and then watch her sit down and look up at me and wait for more patiently until i click and a reward after the click if it comes back no i wouldn't it might know now okay try that no it did come maybe all right just wait and see if she's listening it's looking all right then go ahead now she came back she came back there it is okay so my camera died actually um but looks like the dog's done supposedly if we understand right you do that until the dog gets full and walks away but i will say she was super chill super just sitting there looking very obedient so really hoping this works we're super excited about this pace around to go pink okay i'll let you take her out oh kidding not kidding the next melanie all right one of our girls is out the other one's just running around just getting started she's actually been doing good though oh no babe is that what i think it is what ah did you let her do that literally smell it no i'm sure it is just get paper towels smell it first but now it's walking in oh all right this is just sick what are you doing getting a great angle of the urination yeah and it's palm well i can't see you looked at its face i just gave it a bath last night that's done for already what yeah i think so you're gross all right but that's on us no you just took it outside it didn't do anything and i came back in because it was cold i know i know the trainer don't watch this please um i did i did wrong i confess i kind of feel guilty about it he said we're supposed to stay out there till she goes but all she was doing was playing and then like just sat down and looked up at me and kept doing that over and over a few moments later hang on what was that i think there's a package at the door it's valentine's day tomorrow is valentine's day there's nothing oh wait wait wait let me out there first series berries look the dog's excited too oh layla's just like shhh this is the best day of my life what are you the sweetest human ever how do you know i literally said something about this yesterday she did she actually mentioned sherry's berries yesterday and i had already had them ordered craving them forever this box brings me back memories evan of when we were dating carlin always told me she likes to eat things more than she likes to just stare at flowers so i got on the food train early i like the food what can i say oh they kind of cracked that's annoying oh and now we have a dog so that floor is probably kind of dirty no no no doggy no doggy i'm gonna give you this one oh wow that's a good looking one it's totally fully covered so happy valentine's day y'all did they cut off the green stem yeah okay because that worried me first of all they don't i think they do well then i just have my greens for the day happy valentine's day thank you thank you i love you

caesars crazy bread which i did not get to eat last night because you know why i started keto bat three days ago when i've stayed strong carlin mocked me on instagram the other day and said i would not start back in that i would not keep it the only reason you started it it's because i posted it so far i've done well uh yeah i also got really behind on my bible reading chart and so i've been

coffee actually i'm not even gonna lie i didn't use heavy whipping cream i use french vanilla creamer you know why it's only five carbs for a tablespoon i only used half a tablespoon two and a half carbs i can afford that i think the sugar-free syrup gives it a little bit of a weird after flavor i like sweet things but we're making it work no one cares about your coffee what no one cares about your coffee comment below please tell her that you guys love to hear about my coffee layla's napping so we're gonna leave the door open we also have her on our monitor don't worry she's safe yeah
