hello welcome back to my channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne so excited to have you make sure you subscribe and turn on your notifications if you want to be one of the first get notified when I post a video I've kind of been mi a I just moved across the country this is my first video in my new room and I figured I just do a Q&A just so I could get something up I love Q nays and I have a lot of other videos that are coming I have wedding dress shopping I have moving vlogs however these are just so much easier to edit and I've gotten like a whole week and a half of that posting so I thought this would be something I could knock out pretty quickly and get up for you and a lot of you guys have questions regarding I move the engagement so let's just get into it are you guys moving in together now that you're engaged no me and Kyle will not be living together until after we're married I'll probably find a place for us a month before the wedding and start getting everything set up so it is ready to go after we get married that is something that was super important to me I did not want to live together before getting married for one like with the temptation helps a lot and two I just didn't want it was just something special to wait for for marriage like it's a reward of marriage and I found moving in with a boyfriend in the past it was essentially like giving them all the benefits of being married without the actual commitment to it and really combining your life and building your life with someone that you're not like committed to in God's eyes um someone wants to know if I will share my non-negotiable list yeah so I have a huge list not all of them or non-negotiables but I always share the ones that were so my first non-negotiable is loves God passionately someone who is caring and genuine something I was really important to me was a childlike spirit someone who can lead us in our faith that was a non-negotiable for me someone who was self-aware and always wanting to grow ambitious intelligent someone who is sociable I really wanted someone who was outgoing and with able to talk to new people easily and I think someone who is easygoing was definitely a non-negotiable I don't think I could be with someone who's super Type A or like a perfectionist I definitely need someone who can go with the flow and Kyle's great because he's even more so go with the flow than I am one thing I put down is intentional in his pursuit so the fact that Kyle asked me to be his girlfriend after a few days and was just very clear about where he was at and his intentions with the relationship and then we got engaged quickly that definitely came to fruition those are some of the things in my list hope that helps someone asked where do I shop and outfit inspiration I don't pose a ton of fashion stuff on my channel but that is something I would like to start posting more so if you guys are interested in that let me know I do a lot of online shopping I love like Princess Holly I love a szabo skirt however if I do buy anything from there it's usually from Poshmark Teahupoo I'm actually an ambassador for sho PO I love their clothes but yeah mostly online otherwise sometimes I'll go to a store called last chance and it basically is where all the Nordstrom returns go so you can get it's kind of like thrift shopping but your thrift shopping for brands that are sold at Nordstrom so you can find a lot of higher-end and higher-quality stuff there and that's always fun so what wants a room tour and the moving process like I said I'll be doing a ton of moving vlogs just wanted to get this some kind of video up first so I'll definitely give you a room tour once I get closer to finishing it someone asked if Kyle would share his testimony and I wanted to your opinion on this obviously I've uploaded quite a few videos with Kyle over the past few weeks and he's gonna be a huge part of my life and he loves being in videos with me so I wanted to ask you guys what you prefer I do want Kyle to share his testimony and film a video on it so do you guys prefer the content of us together to be on a separate channel and then this kind of just be like a main channel and then any relationship vlogs or just sit down videos with Kyle on a separate channel or are you okay with it all being on one let me know what you guys want in the comments below that would be very helpful for me a lot of questions about the wedding and when it is we actually just picked a date for our wedding we went and toured a venue the first week we got in Arizona and the date was available we are getting married in October of this year so what is that like eight month engagement seven month engagement what steps have you and Kyle taken to walk out purity avoid temptation and sexual immorality so this is something I told you guys I would definitely share with you and it's been kind of more of a learning process than I thought it would be however I can't wait to talk more in depth with Kyle here about different boundaries we've set in place we'll go more into depth with all of that in a separate video because I really want to like go into that deeper someone asked the old me and Kyle are I am 25 kyle is 28 and we were both born in the fall so I was knocked over he was born in November someone asked how the wedding planning is going so since I knew I was actually gonna get engaged before he proposed I actually started a wedding planning prior to the engagement because I just knew the turnaround time for our wedding wasn't gonna be extremely long we decided in about like eight months would be the most doable for us but we didn't want to wait a full year so I actually started wedding planning before getting engaged which actually became a little bit overwhelming so then I don't know I can go more into depth about everything that happened there so I stopped putting put it in and then I was like I don't want to plan anything until I'm engaged so I can actually enjoy the engagement now that I am engaged I'm starting to wedding plan a little bit like I said we went to go tour venue so I'll be sure to do wedding series videos so if you guys have any questions or requests in that area please leave them in the comments so I know what you guys want to see don't ask your dad before proposing yes so he had planned to sit down with both my parents and ask them for their blessing however we talked about it and decided that that was something we actually wanted to share together so we sat down with my parents and talked to them about it and they were extremely supportive and both of them said yes my mom was ecstatic and my dad asked some good questions but both of them are fully on board someone asked when do we hope to start trying for kids this stuff happens so quickly we want to be married for a while before we start coming coming with kids start trying to have kids we're saying like at least be married for three years and then maybe have a kid our fourth year of marriage but I mean we've never been married and we don't really know what it's like so that can definitely change and it's definitely God's timing I definitely want to be selfish and travel with my spouse and just really give him a lot of my attention before bringing kids into the pictures so we'll probably definitely wait at least two to three years Ellie's have you got any negative reactions to your engagement so nobody I know personally has reacted negatively the only people who have made negative comments are pretty much strangers on our engagement video and it's usually people who haven't even watched me for a long time or watched any of my other videos and they kind of just I think got recommended the video so they have no clue who I am or who Kyle is or our story so yeah those are the only negative comments is just people thinking it's soon however dating isn't really biblical so it really does make sense that you know when you know you want to get married you get married because God doesn't say anything about dating and the whole idea of dating for a long time is definitely of the world so we're definitely not concerned about it and it's really cool to actually look through the comments and see so many other beautiful testimonies of short engagements or just like people getting engaged shortly after they met and how successful all of those bends I have been I have I have yet to see any comments of people saying they got engaged very quickly and it didn't work out when the Lord is at the center of it so what are things you're looking forward to once you're married I would say definitely living together traveling together really just doing life together obviously the physical stuff very excited for that going apartment shopping together eventually having kids like so many things I'm really looking forward to the wedding itself how did you stay close to God like God through college I actually didn't know God until after I graduated so I don't really have any answer for that I'm sure like finding community would definitely help having like starting a woman's Bible study for college-age women I think that would really help you stay close to the Lord and really just finding friends who love Jesus how do I know I'm not in a career rut or is God trying to send me somewhere else that is a great question I don't know I just feel like there is this deep calling within you it that God makes it clear if you need to stay somewhere and you have a purpose there and you're supposed to be like maybe a light in your workplace or if you know it's just a really uncomfortable situation he's calling you to leave I think a ton of prayer will help you have that discernment for me I've been in jobs that weren't necessarily the most fun like waitressing however I knew there was a purpose in them and for me it was learning how to serve others and God was really teaching me a lot there so I think humbling yourself and asking God are you still trying to teach me something here from this discontent or are you telling me to move on because yeah there was this one job that I you know I didn't want to have but God was teaching me so much through it and then more recently when I was waitressing it I kind of just got into a rut where I just really just did not want to be there anymore and I didn't feel like God was teaching me much or calling me to stay there so yeah I think there's just two different feelings that you might have it's like one yeah this wasn't my op like first choice to be here but it got it's teaching me a lot through it or two I'm just super discontent unhappy I like dread going to work I think that is definitely a different situation where maybe God has called you out of it to step into something else someone asked was I ever scared about dating the one thing that I ran into surprisingly not surprisingly was when we first started dating I was really attached to my independence and singleness and a lot of my identity actually was in singleness which I didn't realize because obviously on YouTube I make videos about being single so after me and Kyle started dating it was like I had to shed that piece of my identity and it was like it was my whole life like that's what I there was my ministry it's what I poured into it's what I made videos about it's what I was passionate about it was my whole shindig shindig is my whole nint hold stint no I don't know and I had like even a future planned around my singleness and future content I wanted to make so I think that was the biggest difficulty transitioning into relationship was letting go of my identity in singleness and that my purpose was in being single and God really just showed me you know your purpose isn't in singleness anymore it was but it's not anymore and now I'm putting you in this relationship and giving you new purpose as a couple rather than you on your own so I was very convinced at that I was like better off on my own and I have more purpose in singleness so that was probably the hardest thing transitioning from being single to in a relationship things to look for in finding a church that's an amazing question me and Kyle are actually Church shopping right now so if you guys want a video on kind of our experience with church shopping let me know and we can you know give you the rundown of kind of how we're approaching it and what we're doing obviously I lived here before but I wanted to check out a bunch of different churches so Kyle could really like me and Kyle could really find a church that we both felt at home at instead of him just coming to the church that I used to go to so someone asked how can you make God a priority when you struggle to put your phone away that is a great question and that's actually something I have been struggling with lately is waking up and getting on my phone right away so for me what I do is I put my phone on airplane mode and I don't touch my phone until after I've spent time with God prayed and read a little bit of my Bible and this has only been the last three days so it's something I you know go through waves of struggling with but yeah I think just turning it on airplane mode or turning it off completely and like putting it in another room and just setting a boundary with yourself like I don't touch my phone from 9:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. and using that time to read a devotional or something of that sort but it's really about setting boundaries with your phone is it difficult to keep God first in the midst of the new things going on in your life yes for sure I mean I'm very blessed to be in a relationship where we pray and we go to church together we had a Bible study together and we discuss God together however even when we do all those things it can still feel like you're putting other things before God so that's definitely been a little bit harder for me lately being in a relationship and really finding just time with God on my own and not just with Kyle when I'm focused too much on myself it's really hard for me to focus on God and ministry and you know pouring into others so something I'm working on I think now that I'm settled in a place it'll be a lot easier these pigeons are very loud okay I think I'm gonna wrap up the video now thank you so much for watching if you have any other questions feel free to leave them down below make sure you're subscribed and give this video a thumbs up all right I love you guys and I will see you in a bit hello welcome to of

wedding-dress shopping I'm not engaged yet but of our timeline is super quick and apparently wedding dresses can take up to six to eight months and they recommend did it like it being one of the first things you get and since he's probably not proposing for a few months this is something I have to like pick out before I'm even engaged but yes so that was one of the first things I booked well I just started going through Instagram and Pinterest and kind of getting a feel for what designers I liked and then I went through some local like boutiques in Chicago and then started to see what designers they carry and then look through their lines so today is my first bridal appointment I'm going to Alice and ivory and then also Sarah's seven so yeah this is crazy but I'm really excited I'm picking up my friend Rebecca we're gonna get some coffee and then we're gonna head to the first appointment personally I think I'm gonna like a line dresses I'm kind of in-between I like the 3d floral effects like this so like really kind of intricate detailed and almost like whimsical and girly but then I also like dresses like this that are like very simple I've never tried on wedding dresses so I really don't know what I'm gonna like or really look good in and I think maybe an off-the-shoulder or some kind of straps I don't really love the sweetheart neckline because they just don't have a chest for it so I don't think I love that I don't know if I love strapless but we'll see I definitely love off-the-shoulder so yeah that's kind of like what I'm looking for my budget is between like 2000 and 4000 BC guys we're wondering I'm Roy they recommend telling the stylist your budget is 10% lower than it actually is otherwise they'll probably push more towards the high end of your budget so I'm gonna just let them know that my budgets between like two thousand and three thousand five hundred guys all right well I'm gonna drive and we'll see you a little bit   hi it picked up Rebecca we're gonna go grab some coffee     got Eric Koston a cool story isn't a story meeting bread this by word front       who do you like the beating you like because I like the simple     I like I think you should try on something like that just to know what it looks like on you oh yeah I wanted I wanted to do a two-piece for the longest time mine yeah yeah no you got to show off that neckline okay like it I feel like it's very I really like this texture on you yeah and I feel like it's very like it's like expected of you but in like a good like it feels very true to you oh wow how do you feel big fan of the neckline yes it's so good Wow like to scan this no also it's your wedding day it's literally your wedding day it doesn't it doesn't look like scandalous at all thing   the bride it's so fine uh I love the neckline yeah so fun if I didn't hear it yeah the sparkles in the skirt what the heck yeah do you want to feel like a berry I don't know I love it but because I feel like so willing

do an outro for this video but I hope you enjoyed I absolutely loved wedding dress shopping it was so much fun I did find my dress but it was actually at the next place I went so there will be a whole separate video with more wedding dress shopping which after editing this I'm like I can't believe how many dresses I tried on it's insane but let me know which ones are your favorite I definitely had a top 3 from this video that I really considered so I want to see if you guys like the same as I did I love you guys so much be sure you're subscribed to my channel and let me know in the comments what other wedding videos you want to see good morning and welcome to today's video I thought I would do a day in the life kind of like a weekend in Arizona living in Arizona is a completely different lifestyle than Illinois which I love I love that it is warm and sunny all the time and there's just so many activities going on so today I'm going to a flea market in Phoenix with some of my friends then probably going to lunch I'm really hoping I get to go to the pool today and then later tonight we have like a community family dinner that they're hosting so yes I'm very excited for today's video I also wanted to thank today's sponsor which is Ana Luiza for sponsoring this video I am so excited to work with them if you guys don't know they are a jewelry company and I actually first saw them in Jessica Howells videos and she literally has the best jewelry ever so I was so excited when they reached out to me and asked if I wanted to collaborate with them so I will mention them in a little bit when I get ready all right what to wear today I really need to get rid of some of my clothes so I'll link my Poshmark below if you guys are interested because I definitely am gonna be selling some of this because my closet is stacked okay this is what I'm gonna wear pretty basic and I can take this off if it gets warm maybe get a little Tam today but yeah it looks pretty basic so I'm gonna throw on the pieces that I have to try to dress it up a little bit the thing that I love about their jewelry is it's made from a recycled gold which is so much better for the environment and it also is just super high quality and I have been eyeing high quality jewelry because I kept buying cheap jewelry and it would just garnish garnish tarnish so quickly couldn't shower with anything and I just want high quality pieces that are gonna last so I was super excited about these and their jewelry is actually made from the same manufacturer as Louis Vuitton and Tiffany's so super high quality this is the first thing it's just this really simple beautiful gold bracelet so I'm definitely gonna put this one on I actually don't wear bracelets very often so I'm excited to have like just a really simple beautiful staple bracelet that I can just keep on all the time peace I got let's see I think this is a necklace this just really simple chain necklace they're all so shiny all of these a links below and I also have a code I believe so I will have that linked as well if you guys are in the market for some like high quality jewelry definitely check them out I think it's so much worth investing in and honestly the price points are great they have pieces starting at $49 and they go up from there and they also have some more high-end if you're looking for like something for a special occasion or a gift the last thing is this ring you're looking for some new jewelry that you can actually invest a little bit of money in but it's gonna last you so much longer than all the fashion jewelry that I used to buy definitely check them out I'll have their link in the description I actually decided to swap out my shorts I just really loved the whole white look and then I have these like chunky sandals on which are kind of dirty I saw a girl and she bought a similar pair from Target so I might go check that out but these shorts are from a boutique in LA along with the sandals this is from princess Polly and this I got at the thrift store it was just like a camisole and then I just cut it to crop it and look how good the jewelry looks do you guys think I should have my bracelet on this hand maybe so it doesn't take away from the engagement ring   oh my goodness I love you I love you you've been a bad boy like no pictures please   yeah what you want to be in it what do they do now we just finish up I just left the market now we're at truth foods which is actually where I used to work they have the best food the best food literally it's so good so if you have one near you definitely go to it so we're having some lunch and I think we're gonna go to a goodwill which it's dangerous cuz I've been a good four times this week Saturday half off yeah I have half off like everything around here and back from lunch I didn't even show you the food we were so hungry but I wanted to show you what I got at the markets I picked up this like repurposed goodie and it just has the Eagles and they put in like this scrunched they cropped it and put in like the scrunched and it's super cute you guys didn't know Kyle's from Philadelphia so I thought I would get my first Eagles gear to support his team but this was I think $35 not too bad a lot of them are like $30 which for vintage and like upcycle things it is a good deal so anyway it's been such a long day and now I'm going to meet Kyle I'm at the Scott resort so he's sitting out here at the pool like I said living in Arizona is such a different lifestyle it's like February no it's March and Illinois it's so cold and here Kyle's just like sitting at the pool so just got to the Scott so I'm gonna go meet him just hang out by the pool probably gonna get a little bit of work done that I behind on this thing about Arizona is a lot of the resorts you can just go in during the day and hang out by the pool and you can order drinks or food there and you don't really have to pay anything it's like you don't have to actually be staying at the resorts so this is one of our favorites it's called the Scot it's absolutely beautiful I'll show it to you I mean first off look at this landscaping it's so pretty you was this high you so cute headed to the family dinner that's what I'm wearing this jumper is from the market in Maui so I love it and super comfortable my jewelry is transitioning well into the night hi honey can you take a video of my hair you look so beautiful oh thanks I followed a tutorial on YouTube is super easy so I'll link it below and then I just added this clip that I just got alright     of Jesus     you just got out of church you don't mind my bib we are still looking at charges so we can kind of go over our thoughts on the church and kind of like what we're looking for in a church but I just need a break well brunch is made breakfast sandwiches I don't even know where I left off I did a whole photo shoot for a jewellery company and then we came to coffee shops you just work on some client stuff now we're headed to a Porsche at 90 we still need to talk to them about the church oh yeah maybe we can talk about that on the drive and then yeah we're headed to a worship night at Hillsong in Phoenix now I'm gonna walk them to oncoming traffic     we actually after the worship night went out for Thai food it was delicious now we're both working you're so good at procrastinating but I needed to update them about church yeah very good timing I want to tell them about our church finding experience ladies first so we're looking for charity rizona we visited now three churches because we went to two today yeah cuz I guess it is that an actual service we're really looking to like feel super connected definitely good worship really convicted pastor who I don't know challenges us I guess just like the whole package something I'm like really feels like home and obviously could worship good message all that's super important but you know you can go to means so far the church has been good worship good message you know can't complain about it but there's like a difference when you walk into a place and it just feels like home like that's where you know you want to plant your flag so we're just kind of looking for that and you know we don't want to like shortchange any churches you can just want to bounce around all the local ones that were aware of and yeah but this one was really cool earlier the first one it was really cool I like seeing all generations worshipping there's a lot of diversity and people there and it's definitely filled with the Holy Spirit yeah very much spirit so powerful and they also did a huge emphasis on prayer and like praying over the people there yeah I loved when because we were all all dealing with things right and we have some sort of kid some sort of you know a lot of people were dealing with like really deep strongholds and bondage so like they actually took the time in the middle of the message for anyone who was struggling to stand up and then everybody else around them and I prayed over them yeah and yeah I was just so he could tell people were being delivered from you know their strongholds and then at the end having the prayer team for people to come up and receive prayer I've never seen a church where they were like one enough prayer warriors like people in the front to actually pray not that there weren't a lot but like there was so many people that was so yeah and then the church we went to at nighttime we thought it was just gonna be a worship night but there was awesome and that one was Hillsong and we went to the Phoenix location yes so yeah so then I keep checking out a few before we make any decisions right yeah keep going but yeah what do you guys look for in a church let us know in the comments hello everyone welcome to my channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne and I'm so excited to be making this video this is more like my traditional videos I'm used to there's been a lot of moving content but today we're gonna do a good old-fashioned sit-down video and I haven't done release in a while so bear with me so today I went to church and this is in the midst of all of the craziness going on with the coronavirus so some of this will speak into that but I heard a message today at church and it was five ways to kind of protect yourselves or guard ourselves against worry and anxiety and I thought the message was really great especially during a time like this where all of those emotions are heightened right now and a lot of people are filled with fear so I kind of just wanted to take the points he made during service and reiterate them in my own unique way in this video I will have the full message by the pastor linked in the description you guys haven't been here before I typically make a lot of faith related and lifestyle videos so this is something you're interested in please be sure to subscribe and get this video thumbs up I would love for you to stick around because y'all are awesome 5 tips to keep worry and anxiety out of your life for me personally I am kind of like an ignorant sis blessed kind of person I don't get too engulfed in a lot of fear driven things especially like this virus I'm just like all right I'm gonna go like lay by the pool and just continue on with my day I think there's a fine balance where we do need to be precautious and aware of what's going on however we don't need to let it rule our lives or to live in fear so let's get into the first point which is the first thing that we need to do is guard our minds through verse I want to reference in this it proverbs 4:23 I have it in two versions so the New King James Version is keep your heart with all diligence for out of it spring the issues of life and the New Living Translation is guard your heart above all else or it determines the course of your life so the pastor kind of focused on this as we need to understand that from our heart control Ike the Bible says it determines the course of our life and in the other version it says spring the issues of life so basically a lot of the issues of life are coming from our hearts and where our hearts are so we need to be careful on what we're consuming what we're watching what we're listening to what things were taking as facts or not are we guarding our hearts against just the troubles of this world at the end of the day God is you know the end-all be-all he has the final say he's in all of control so are we trying to take that control into our own hands sometimes we compute ourselves over information on things when we really just need to be guarding what we consume what we're taking in and who we're listening to what we're listening to and what kind of work feeding ourselves spiritually so especially at a time like this it is very important to be listening to uplifting reminders and just sermons that are leading us back to God and trusting God social media is kind of crazy right now so if all of that is building up a lot of fear in you then I encourage you not to be consuming it and this can apply to so many other things in life guarding your heart is just a prayer that I would pray especially into dating that was a prayer that I prayed a lot was God just guard my heart because you know if I allow things into my heart for example what other people say about me or just lies from the enemy that will translate into how they live and treat others so all right the second thing to guard against worry in fear is to give our worries and peers over to God and that leads me to Psalm 55:22 and it says cast your burden on the Lord and he shall sustain you he shall never permit the righteous to be moved another good verse is Philippians 4 or do not be anxious about anything but in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving present your requests to God and the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus that kind of even ties in to kind of like the last point so basically with this is we were not created to sustain or contain all of this fear and to hold it and to carry it on our backs as fear and anxiety we weren't created to handle of that that is like like that's a big part of why God wants relationship with us is to take that burden office that is literally the reason why Jesus was sent here was to carry the burden of our sins and that includes our fear and anxiety like Jesus would died to carry that for us and looking over these verses God is literally asking us to cast these burdens onto him he says cast your burden onto the Lord and he shall sustain us he'll never permit the righteous to be moved all of us to say is that if you are feeling worried anxious about anything right now any area of your life whether it's we're going to college or your health or a job or money all of these should be cast upon the Lord he is there to help us with these burdens and really just carry these burdens for us surrender them to Jesus lamb at his feet he literally came to this earth and died for all of those things so we could experience the peace of God which transcends all understanding and that's a huge thing is like we might not understand everything that's going on or why it's going on or what's gonna happen but we don't need to because God's peace transcends all understanding I'm sitting here telling you I have no idea what's gonna happen I really don't however I still have access to God's peace and it will always transcend understanding and I don't really need to necessarily try or force myself to understand everything that's going on I mean with the media and all that stuff it is almost impossible to really know what is true and what is not another great verse is Matthew 6:34 give your entire attention to what God is doing right now and don't get worked about what may or may not happen tomorrow God will help you to deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes I think that is a huge thing as we are constantly getting worried about tomorrow next week next month and it does really build up that fear and anxiety within us and I do believe there is a healthy balance of preparing for the future and having an idea but when it comes to what may or may not happen and kind of this by chance or the unknown that is something God asks us not to worry or get worked up about he wants us to give our entire attention to what God is doing right now what God is doing right now and if you really think about that if like you're in a state of worshipping or praying and talking to God when you're in his presence there is no room to worry about what may or may not happen tomorrow and he says right here that when it does come up whether that be good or bad because I'm not saying that life is gonna be perfect or everything's gonna be good and easy but when it does come god is gonna be there to help us so we don't need to get worked about it worked up about it today alright point number three is God is in control Wow I mean does that just set you free I don't know hallelujah God is in control at the end of the day God is so much bigger than us and he is in control something the pastor really dug into at church was that he really prays that this could be just a wake-up call of what we put our trust in we have to remember that you do not and should not put our faith in all those things we are supposed to love God above all those things so when all those things do crumble or seem unstable we are still filled with joy filled with the Holy Spirit and filled with peace because God should come before all of those things and that's really our source of life he is the river that we drink from number four God knows the future this is just an amazing thing to remember that he knew that this was coming he knows all the hardships in life aren't gonna come our way and he knows what's gonna happen once they pass if they're gonna pass how it's gonna affect us he knows all these things and in that God has a plan for us and it is good number five trials bring me closer to Christ one thing he said during the message was trials purify our lives I really love that second Corinthians 12:7 through nine Paul says keep me from becoming proud I was given a thorn in my flesh a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from becoming proud three different times I begged the Lord to take it away each time he said my grace is all you need my power works best in weakness so now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses so that the power of Christ can work through me the thorn in the flesh it says a messenger from say Satan to torment me so this thorn was actually not given by God but it was given by Satan and even though it was given by Satan God still did not remove it because he knows exactly when his power works best and that is when we are in weakness isn't that true whenever we need something or we are going through his just a struggle we definitely cling to God more and that's when we really see his power just shine through so he knows how his power works and when it is used best and it is in weakness so although the devil may throw things at us or put thorns in our flesh God will still use those and it says he did this to keep him from becoming proud he said that twice and I think that's just a reminder that sometimes God does allow things to happen and he won't necessarily remove us from a situation however he will walk through a situation with us because his grace is all we need so we don't necessarily need every hardship and every struggle to be removed from our lives however we do need God's grace and not only that we should be boasting in our weakness because that's what its gonna bring the most glory to God is how he uses us when we're weak and it keeps us humble we have to remember that sometimes it's trials that bring us closer to God it is what deepens our relationship with Christ and I know if I hadn't gone through a lot of hard things in life and honestly in the moments when I was the most desperate that is when I took the most steps to deepen my relationship with God and obviously we wish he wasn't like that but we are imperfect and we are human I've heard just countless testimonies it's usually when we were at our worst in life when we finally discover God and you know accept him into our lives those are five ways that we can really guard our hearts from worry and anxiety especially in a time like this I think we should all join together in prayer during this time that just what is going on it can actually lead people to Jesus and that God can use all of this to create a revival all over this world of people who are searching for just something to rely on and build a foundation on that isn't of this world because it's times like this where we really realize and have that wake-up call that none of these things on earth are going to bring us peace because at any moment they could be gone we can pray for everyone spiritual life to grow during this time and you know if you're just ever in a crowd of people and you just sense people's fear with what's going on start praying just start praying this is an amazing time to practice our spiritual powers in prayer and being prayer warriors here on earth when just there's a lot of chaos going on quickly I'll just give a quick testimony I was actually just checking out at the grocery store and if you were gonna grocery store like god bless you let's all be praying for people who work at these stores because they have not had any time off because of how busy it is and how demanding encourage everyone to lift up all of the cashier in the grocery stores thank you for everything you do so I was checking out today and the cashier was definitely just a little bit defeated and tired and he that you know he woke up at 5:00 a.m. to work his first job at a gym and then straight from that he had to start this job and he's been going into overtime and he's just really tired and I just let him know that I would pray for him his name is Noah if you guys want to join me and prayer for him he just said like thank you like that really means a lot I think it's in those moments where we can encourage those people and immediately pray for people like know who are working really long hours right now and who are completely exhausted I got to share like the love of God and just the power of prayer and remind him that God is here for him and he sees him and he wants him to have that rest in peace during this crazy time I hope this video encourage you today if you really resonated with what was said definitely send it to a friend or family member who might be filled with anxiety or fear right now I love you guys so much if there is any specific prayers that you guys want me to pray for or want the community to pray for please leave them in the comments and I just encouraged my whole audience to go down in the comments and let's be some prayer warriors and just pray over all of these requests for people who might be struggling right now whether that's in the US or across the world we're here for you in spirit and in prayer we want to surround you and they love you so thank you guys so much god bless you have an amazing day I did not grow up in faith I did not believe in Jesus at all in fact it was more of a hobby of mine to make fun of Christians three hardcore years of depression really hit the point of suicide you know multiple times driving hundred miles down the road bow my eyes out about to turn into oncoming traffic and by the way you know that emptiness inside you the only way you're ever filled up is through a relationship with Jesus I literally didn't go to the gym I stopped doing business I wasn't talking like anybody I was just depressed and I was watching Jesus sermon so I was smoking weed all day long   hello everyone welcome back to my channel bye many special requests we are going to film Kyle's testimony video so you can get to know him a little bit better in his story and how he was brought to God so I'm actually gonna go cook breakfast and leave this kid here alone with you guys to tell you his story mmm you guys are stuck with me yeah it's a really amazing beautiful testimony so I'm so excited that you're gonna get to share it so y'all have fun all right bye-bye love you oof it's about time no I'm just kidding isn't Cayenne amazing just absolutely love her so much she is just incredible and I know all you know this from watching her and following her and getting to know who she is she's just truly somebody that I'm so blessed to be able to run with in this life because of how much she loves God and how much she truly just wants to help people it is inspiring to say the least and I'm just so grateful to be a part of this to be here with you guys to get to share God's story what he did in my life and just help you to see how much he loves you you know how much he truly just wants to provide for you and wants to help you to become who it is that he created you to be my story is interesting for some of you may know most you probably don't but I did not grow up in faith I did not believe in Jesus at all in fact it was more of a hobby of mine to make fun of Christians who put their faith and hope in Jesus it's wild it's messed up I know but it's true that's how I was I just thought people put their faith in Jesus because they couldn't handle the real world right they couldn't handle it on their own so they had to put their faith and belief in something that's not even real because it made them feel better about not being able to handle it right but anyways yeah so I grew up in Philadelphia right outside of Philadelphia mom dad three sisters you know not perfect but amazing and I'm very blessed by them I'm very blessed to say that I have you know two parents still in my life and then I have three sister dari blessed to say I always had a roof over my head food on the table clothes on my on my back so for me growing up I kind of bounced around from friend group to friend group trying to find my place didn't really know where I fit in but how I always I always craved that real relationship right now I'm sure it's most of you can relate to this but I was just crave like those real people in my life that would truly support me back me up be there for me that I could have real conversations with that we talk about real things be there for each other to run in life together right and that was always tough to find but because of that I've started bouncing around from group to group trying to find my place and you know some may say I was loyal to a fault started get attached to somebody I'd be like wow this is that person and I would be like so loyal and like giving and the next thing you know I get taken advantage of and it would put me in like a really dark place of just hopelessness you know and confusion and this led to you know me getting into a lot of fights I ended up you know through middle school into high school and into college getting into 50-plus fights fist fights in my life only through many relationships dating many different girls trying to final and you know that that real person that I could run with and it was just a mess it was a mess I was putting my hope and my faith in all the wrong places it led me to getting into drinking it led me to experimenting with drugs it led me to doing things that I really didn't want to do you know looking back I never wanted to do them but I did them because I thought it would fill me it would fill that emptiness that I had inside me I thought it would help me to feel connected and to feel part of something right because at the end of the day that's all we want us to feel like we're a part of something it took me down a very hard road I didn't have any faith I more so had a lot of pride I'm also had a pretty hidden big ego right it wasn't like you would meet me be like wow you got a big ego but like internally I was like hiding it but I had a pretty big ego and it got in my way a lot one thing one pivotal moment really in my life was when I got into the most serious relationship I have ever been in until Cayenne we dated for five years you know dating through high school going into college her and my best friend's my group they all went to one school I went to a different school and then after one semester I decided I'm gonna transfer over to that school because I want to be with her and I wanted to be with my boys right so I did that I made that move and I made it for that you know because of I mean really care about school I didn't know why I was going to school I just wanted to be with them and then when I get there what happened was you know my girlfriend decided to join a sorority Greek life my boys did the same thing and they joined a fraternity and you know I was not about it I was like I'm not joining this stuff I'm not doing it you guys have fun but of course when you know all of your friends start joining something and you don't starts to become a separation and I felt like I was getting left behind so after the next semester went by I decided I'm gonna join too because I couldn't go to the parties with them I couldn't really be around my girlfriend or my friends because they were always around the Greek life right I joined the ones my boys joined and I thought it was just gonna make everything better and it didn't what happened was not too long later my girlfriend she she cheated on me you know she ended up meeting some fraternity guy and hook him up with him and ended up like dating the guy and just cheated on me and you know when I tried to figure out why I tried to get answers she wouldn't give me any it was just stop talking to me leave me alone and like I was cut off so whatever I was like you know what forget you I got my boys so I go to my friend's I'm living with them in the same park man I'm like yo you know like looking for that support that love and they bait Stickley cut me off as well and they chose her and they decided to stop hanging out with me stop talking to me and just go every morning wake up go across the street hang out with her all day and I don't have to sit there looking out the window watching them go over there hang out with her and her friends all day because she hung out with all the hot girls so they basically chose girls over me so I was like you know what forget you go hang out with the fraternity brothers but I just couldn't really connect with them and after a couple parties they actually told me to stop coming to the parties because she didn't feel comfortable coming and she brought the hot girls with her as well overnight it seemed like I lost my girl I lost my boys the fraternity brothers did down on me as well and yeah I just felt like there was no point to life I felt like there was no reason behind it it shouldn't be this way but it is this way and I don't know why it's this way so what's the point I give up right so that took me down a very dark road I call it the dark days they turned into dark weeks in the dark months in the dark years probably went through about three hardcore years of depression really hit the point of suicide you know multiple times driving hundred miles down the road all my eyes out about to turn into oncoming traffic which was so selfish and praise the Lord even though I didn't believe in him or know him he put my mom in my head before I could ever do it every single time because he knew I could never do that to my mom just so many countless nights of drinking and doing drugs and just crying myself to sleep like a baby and feeling so hopeless and helpless and and I could not understand how people could be so cruel how the world could be the way that it is and you know I lost my faith in my hope in humanity altogether a couple years ago by I'm now a fifth year senior in college two classes to go to graduate and I went on this family reunion to Maryland where a cousin of mine from Indiana she was there we only saw each other like once every four to eight years but she was there and we connect very well and basically she long story short called me out you know asked me why I was so miserable I got really defensive really mad like you never ask somebody who's depressed why are you so miserable because they're not in the right mindset to receive that right so instead I got really defensive and mad but after thinking about it processing it I realized dang like it's a good question like why am i this way like what is going on why am I gonna live the rest of my life this way like what can I do about this so I asked her and she's like listen I met some people in Michigan they changed my life they can change yours too you got to come meet them and thank God for Rachel my cousin who told me this because this was just another really pivotal moment in my life that changed my life forever and long story short from there I said okay when can I come a week later after that trip I went home and then I ended up driving up to Michigan from Philadelphia to meet these people that changed her life and I got to really connect with these guys Jamie and Luke and you know Christian Alex and all these people Tom and just all these people I got to meet all these people connect with all these people and I was just like wow like these are some real people these are people that you know they're actually doing something with their life they're actually helping people they're actually trying to make the world better and you know they were running this business they had this whole movement going on young pros are you gonna do in Jesus name sunshine in Jesus name Sun shine right now yes let's go and then next thing you know I had an opportunity to move out to Michigan actually move in with these guys it was actually time to go back to school and instead I decided to push it off and move the Michigan off a leap of faith to live with bunch people I didn't really know to attempt to do what they were doing to get the life that they were living they got me really diving into personal development self-help stuff as well as like business training tactics and skill sets building all that up and I became obsessed with it man I started studying all this stuff like you wouldn't believe I I'm like there was a point where I didn't leave my room for like a couple months straight cuz I was just obsessed with it and I was just studying and like literally transcribing everything I was listening to him reading and taking it all in and I thought this was gonna be my my my healing my my salvation in a way but it only goes so far because even though I studied all this stuff and I learned all this stuff and I was no longer suicidal and I was no longer like really depressed I still empty inside so I tried harder I studied more and I tried harder in business I found more success and I started travelling and I started exploring the world and meeting new people and doing all this amazing stuff and I was still empty inside there was this nasty void that would not go away no matter what I did the party and the drugs the girl has never worked the business to travel the success never worked the personal development the self-help all of it and never worked it only got me so far but I was still empty inside and I could not understand why alright remember all this time I'm an atheist like I don't believe in a higher power and God creator nothing like that like I have no idea about what the purpose of being on earth is or any of it so I I got to this point where I thought you know this is as good as it's gonna get and I just gotta suck it up and take it for what it is the cool part is is that even though I was at that point God wasn't you know he was still looking over me he was still trying to you know help me come to him help me see that he is real he is there and I'd be lying if I said there weren't times throughout this journey where I started thinking maybe right maybe there's something maybe there's a creator I know at one point I got to like through personal development self-help I got to like the universe right the universe has me the universe will provide you know and that was probably like maybe a year or two before I I really got encountered by Jesus and I started I guess getting a little agnostic right he took me from atheist agnostic and then what happened was that we went on this mission trip to Gary West Virginia where this was like five or six years ago so the first couple years I just wasn't really about the the Bible time the Jesus time the God time any time they pulled it out I was in the back with my buddy like look at these idiots right but come like that third year I think everything changed because we're still going to do the service I love helping people I love working in this area and Gary West Virginia beautiful people beautiful place just really broken and rundown so being able to serve them was incredible but it was never about Jesus it was just about me and that's self-fulfillment right this time around I had this guy come up to me he was kind of running the whole thing and he just asked me straight up he says so why don't you believe in Jesus and I was very prideful with my answer right I made fun of Christians you know I had a big ego when it came to this very prideful in my answer and I was just like well let me tell you and I start going into all the reasons why I hated religion and he stopped me so I didn't say religion I said Jesus and I said what what's the difference right and that's when I learned about relationship versus religion and they didn't go deep into it it was just a couple minutes and he said jesus loves you he is alive he wants a relationship with you and by the way you know that emptiness inside you the only way you're ever fill that is through a relationship with Jesus right at that point I'm like who are you talking to how do you know I have emptiness assignments at this point I got it masked I gotta cover it up right personal oh my self-help is very good for covering things up so I'm like how does he know that now looking back I knew God told him he just turns around and walks away I was just like why and I couldn't get that thought out of my head it's like the only way to fill this emptiness is through relationship with Jesus because I tried it through with everything else business travel personal development drugs girls drinking partying all of it nothing nothing ever worked I said what do I have to lose not much what do I have to gain a whole lot we go back home I'm staying with my buddy Jamie I'm actually on the couch and I got hit with so much depression going back home it was wild like back to where like in a way where I was not suicidal but like really deep in depression so I remember I'm in the shower Brett when we get back and I said you know what let's do this thing I said you know what his word for work I said alright dude if you're real prove it to me and I challenged him disclaimer if you're gonna challenge God get ready he will show himself he will prove you wrong and that's what he did so I have this mentality if I'm gonna do something I'm gonna do it for a year if it doesn't work after a year I know it's not me that didn't work it's it that didn't work but if you quit before a year I see that as you quit too soon you didn't give it enough time and it's you that didn't work so I gave Jesus the same opportunity I said I I'm gonna give you a year so for the next well it only took him three months for the next three months what I did was every single morning every single day I woke up I grabbed my weed I'd spark it smoke it I type in Jesus sermons on YouTube not knowing what to look up or what to expect or what I should be looking for I just want to know who this Jesus character was and I press play and after one youtuber would go to the next and the next and the next and the next and I would do this all day every day no joke I literally didn't go to the gym I stopped doing business I wasn't talking like anybody I was just depressed and I was watching Jesus sermon so I was smoking weed all day and it was crazy like it didn't feel like anything was changing or anything was happening kept doing it kept doing it and three months later I wake up one morning and I go from my weed and I didn't want it so that's weird I go to press play and I stopped and I was like something is different I felt different for the first time in my life I felt whole I felt for I started freaking out you know I was I was losing it I was scared because I was so comfortable feeling empty I was confused on what this feeling was even though it felt so good I remember running to one of my boys and I was telling them dude I'm freaking out I'm freaking out they're like what's wrong I said nothing that's the problem and they're like bro that's Jesus I was like this is Jesus like yeah it's like I want more I need more of Jesus so I remember after that I went back you know to the place I was staying at I fell on my knees and I started crying out and just laying it all out and just professing that he's real not he's alive and that he's with me and just in so much gratitude and Thanksgiving just lay my life out to him and saying God if you gave me this when I'm not obedient what are you gonna do for me when I am obedient so I want to be obedient I want to live for you and I laid it all out I remember I was bawling my eyes out giving it to him and he was just shredding just shedding so much off of me at that time it was crazy long story short he hit me with this revelation of okay you want to be obedient to me you're done with all this you're done business you're done traveling you're done with relationships outside of me you're done with girls you're done with partying with all of it the drugs the drinking you are moving home back to Philly with mom and dad which by the way I said I'd never move back to Philly I was done with that place I never want to go back and he goes you're moving home with mom and dad to build a foundation in me and I'm like okay like actually I was like crap really good but then I was like okay all right let's do it so from there I moved back home with mom and dad and it ended up being the best move I could ever make in my entire life like it just beats the rest I got to I got to be still and just really dive in deep with a relationship with Jesus building that strong foundation in him what he continued to renew me transformed me and set me free from all of the chains that were holding me down to the point where he had me launch a ministry and help a young adults growth group grow and really just help people find their identities in Christ which is all this amazing stuff that we could dive deeper into if you guys want to know about this just let us know you know drop some questions in there if you want us to answer those and we can definitely do more videos on this stuff but it truly was just such such a blessing the best two years of my life and it set me up for everything that he's got before me today with cayenne and all these exciting things that are happening so you know when it comes down to it it's just incredible to realize truly realize how God is real he is alive he loves you so much and all he wants us to build a relationship with you he's just waiting for you to initiate that relationship and just to trust him with it to surrender and joyful obedience and receive the abundant life in Christ that he freely wants to give you and I guys I'm just a testament to that all glory to God everything that I just shared with you is all from him and and it's amazing because you know he's doing the same thing in you guys as well and building this incredible story in your lives to share with other people that will also glorify him in such incredible ways so with that being

today's video love y'all alright let's go see what we can find I   really like this stand it's kind of like a bar cart but I would definitely have to paint it or something but I don't know what color I would go it's definitely really cool it's just this color is pretty ugly it's $10       Ketel is so cute I just wish it wasn't signed   Department like a vintage camera back   and I want to do the haul I want to do a thrift store haul but I also want to go to home goods because I didn't get a chance to go yesterday cuz me and Kyle ended up going to a couples Bible study so before I do anything I want to get this room like actually clean so I just thought I would include a little cleaning time-lapse like quality content I am providing here you're welcome so just sit back grab a drink a snack and just just take in this moment of me cleaning cuz I know it's gonna feel good for you     I cleaned up the room and now I will show you guys what I got from the thrift store so what my room looks like so this is my bed I have my stuff for the hole and then all this stuff I want to put in a nightstand that I need to buy still this chair it's not mine but I think I'll just keep it she said I could keep it in my room so I'm not really sure those will be decor at some point and then this is the wall that's pretty much set up I need to buy a pot for that today I'm actually putting this in the garage once I get my new nightstand so that will be out of here and let me just kind of have like this empty corner over here so maybe I'll get some kind of bookcase or something to organize more just to fill up this wall but yeah first thing is this mug it is actually from world market and this was a dollar 49 just thought it was like pretty unique and looked handmade then I found this this was for 49 and this was handmade it has a little thing in the middle so I'm pretty sure it's used for like jewelry so that's what I'm gonna use it forward to put my rings on and then other jewelry inside there the next thing I found was this basket and I thought this was perfect for a plant so I'm gonna try to find a plant for this today this was only 249 then I went into the linen section and I actually found a lot of things that I liked so the first thing I found was just this piece of fabric it has like a really great material it's super soft and I just thought this would be really great for flat laying photos if I need to style anything in the future same thing with this I found this curtain and it's just like a really beautiful champagne silky material this girl I follow on Instagram named Sri she does these really cool photos with like a cloth in the backdrop so I thought I would maybe try to use this for that it is this kind of like linens or like weave throw you can see the pattern of it and then it has fringe on the end I'm not sure if this is a blanket or just a piece of fabric but it feels like it could be a blanket it's really more for decoration so I might throw this over the chair or replace this gray blanket because I don't really have any other gray in my room so I might throw it on there the last piece of home decor that I got Wendy's of Records and I kind of just looked through the records and thought they would be a cool decor piece to like have sitting in the back of a shelf like up there I could have them leaning against the wall so the first one I found was this one and I just really love the burnt orange color of it and then I couldn't really find any other one so then I started looking at the backs of them and I found this one and I just thought it was just a cool design it has this guy kissing her against a tree like the front is really ugly but the back of its really cool so I thought I could style it like this really cool now let's get into the clothes first was this Arizona Cardinals t-shirt and when I go shopping at their stores I always go to the men's section usually and I go in like the large extra-large because that's where I usually find things that I like I'm gonna crop this one I really like the neckline on it that's something I look for when I'm going through the shirts is really nice material like fabric I often just feel the fabric and that's how I kind of look for some quality things and also the neckline so another neckline that I really liked was this one oh this was a dollar ninety-nine so this is the next thing I got and it's just like this huge oversized sweater it is an extra large but I really love the neckline of this also the material it's a really thick the key details on the sleeves it reminded me easy something like Hermes II and the back has this nice detail on it so this is probably either something I'll just wear as an oversized hoodie or I'll crop it I found this one and I just thought it was really cute with this stripe it looks like something that would be sold out like brandy melville I'm definitely planning to profit the next thing was this shirt I really love the pattern on it and it also has like a cool little embroidery and this was 329 and it's an XXL okay this is my favorite clothing item that I found and it is this sweater I love it the brand is Izod and it is a size large it was 329 but just like a look at these colorings it's super soft so I really I'm excited to crop this one as well today I'm gonna go to home goods and look for a nightstand a hamper and a pop for that plant find the out of the house I'm going to put in my whitening trays I did actually do a sponsored video with smile brilliant and we just ordered another set for Kyle to use but basically they make you like custom trays if you guys are interested you can definitely go watch that other video thought while I run errands it's that perfect time to wipe my teeth because I haven't done it in a while and I've been drinking a lot of coffee       I headed to another HomeGoods I really like tonight's no doubt the other place but I figured we'd come check out to see if there's anything at this other location before I decide this one has a lot of furniture   I really like these lights but I have no idea where I would put it if my bed site I mean it just takes up a lot of room I thought it would be cool to hang from the ceiling I don't know I'm gonna put in my card just in case I wanted to show you guys what I picked up from home des so I got these mesh produce bags these are great when you're buying produce you can throw your onions in here that way you don't accuse the plastic bags there comes with three sizes also got some Tupperware then we got this plant it was let's see what it's called 798 that's the name of it don't make me pronounce it and I found this what is this called a bedside table and it's exactly what I was looking for you guys can see I was looking at another one but the other one was kind of meant for bathrooms so I was so happy I found this one and it was on sale it was on clearance for $64 because the drawers are just a little bit troublesome but it works for $64 it definitely looks like a higher-end piece of furniture next to my bed I got this Voss I just picked these up today and like I'm kind of having buyer's regrets because I paid $24 for a bundle of these I'm pretty sure I can find these in the wild for free but there we go this was $12.99 I actually I mean I really do like it but I might return it or I might just have to buy like a bigger kind of like dried plant maybe put it in the corner but these kind of just look sad with such a big opening then we got all over a home look how beautiful this pot is it is it was $24 so we put oli in there and then we also got this basket this was $20 still has its tags on it and I bought this plant which is a fiddly and it was $23 and I just thought it was so cute and I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep it in this basket because it's a little bit big for it but I think as it grows it'll look good I don't know what do you guys think then I got this hamper right now has some clean clothes I need to put away like a decorative basket I don't know but I thought it was cute this was 20 dollars so I got this you guys recommended on Instagram then I get up Pavo Pavo and this one I need to buy a pot for still but it's supposed to grow really quickly and it grows hanging so I thought it was perfect for the bookshelf I'll just need to get a pop for it hello editing cayenne here I hope you have enjoyed the video if you guys want some more home decorating stuff let me know honestly I don't have really much else to do look at this beautiful poem that I got Thank You Kyle I'll have to tell you guys the story of that later it was quite scarring and tragic but yeah actually this is the red one I think it was this one thank you is this these two are

need to get done but I promise some more sit-down videos will be coming soon so I love you guys so much hello everyone welcome back to the channel my name is cayenne and I'm Kyle this is Kyle my fiance we are gonna be answering some questions today and we're just gonna get right into it cuz there's so many we want to get through and there's some amazing questions that you guys asked I asked you guys over on Instagram if you're not following us I'll have them both linked in the description below that's usually where I ask people questions so if you want to be a part of the next Q&A definitely follow us over there so shall we Michelle okay so two of the most asked questions y'all are so funny are sexual boundaries and how did we know that the other person was the one and I think that's a question we get people messaging us about as well it's like how do I know that God wants us together so to go into more detail on me the way I knew the first thing God did was I think it was the third day a third or fourth day I was in the shower fourth day I was in the shower and God told me to start thinking about the list that I had made of the characteristics I wanted in a future husband and this was the first time God had ever called me to compare a man to that list but even then I like didn't get ahead of myself I was just like okay God noted because everything I could think of Kyle checked off but still I was like guarding my heart in this and then it was probably the sixth or seventh day where God just who really gave me peace like this is gonna be husband so definitely was kind of like I was hearing forgot hearing from God and yeah I had a lot of peace about it and it just didn't feel right to just say maybe we'll get married you know yeah I made it clear what about you yes so for me I God was opening me up back to relationships again leading into this and you know I didn't know I wasn't searching for it I wasn't looking for it but when I met Cayenne it just we clicked so well and like Holy Spirit just brought us together and through a lot of Prayer and a lot of time with the Lord he just kept giving me so much peace about it and so much confirmation that this is gonna be somebody very special in my life and we had seven days together on the ship to really dive in and get to know each other and you know by day seven I just knew and he made us so clear and we were praying on it and he just spoke to me and he was like yeah this is this is your wife this is who I am blessing you with yeah so I think within that look for peace clarity and confirmation yeah absolutely when it comes to that yeah he's not a God of confusion he'll let you know and he'll fill you with this piece of it yeah when you're ready to know you know he might not reveal it to you right away and they're probably specific reason for that right so many things about boundaries there was some really great specific ones how do you deal with sexual temptations practical boundaries to establish in dating physical / emotional boundaries in dating versus engagement so so many good questions about boundaries and like I said before we're gonna do a whole video on it cuz it was kind of a longer process than I imagined I thought it was gonna be just like super easy day one these are the boundaries yeah but it actually took us until now which is what three a little bit over three months to really get a feel for what our boundaries need to be I mean we have some very clear ones in the beginning yeah and obviously there every last thing they're gonna stay yeah we're not swaying from those but it's more so like the kissing and those kind of boundaries that we had a figure yes so that was our biggest boundaries where we weren't gonna go pass kissing right / making out I guess right so that has always been a boundary I know always will tell marriage always will and someone specifically asked like how far we've gone sexually I appreciate your bulbs we have not done anything besides kiss yeah that's it stand strong in that word okay we just had to make a whole video about it because there's so much detail I want to go into but we all just give you like what they are and then in our boundaries video we'll go into more detail about how we arrived there lessons we learned places we messed up and all that stuff in more details good so our first boundary is no sleeping over and that's not something we've been perfect at and it was just like Oh get in that later but yeah that is a boundary that is now set in stone is no spending the night with each other right want to save that for marriage yes okay next one so no making out laying down or sitting up yes just like basically like if we're standing because it's not gonna leave it like any other sexual temptation you know we're kissing that way but outside of that you know we don't want to be put in a position that can lead us toward that temptation of going deeper and falling in some more or following into lust which is you know very simple for you know anybody to do so put that boundary up and once again want to save that for marriage as well mm-hmm I think just in general no masturbating like we neither of us do that Kyle doesn't watch porn I don't watch porn and that is helped tremendously I think and set us up and that's something we started doing before we met each other so that has a really as well because if we were just not doing anything sexually but I was still doing sexual stuff in my own time it would definitely make me more lustful and desire to like lead us into that even deeper because of what I was doing in my personal time so that is another thing to consider as well absolutely and even more so it's also you know honoring God with our bodies these temples that he bless us with like he doesn't want us doing that kind of stuff so it's something that you need to be very clear and concise with in the beginning and making sure you're not doing that and if you are then doing what you need to do to get out of that place mm-hmm I'm trying to find another that one ro whose reference at first hello first kind things yeah so somebody asked us just to go into a little bit deeper someone asked us about first Corinthians 7:1 don't you think guide you guys are breaking that rule by kissing and touching even if you guys will still get married but currently not love you thanks love you too appreciate that question so we did look up that verges just so we could go through it again so the the biggest statement in it is it is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman but because of the temptation to sexual immorality and then it goes on to say you should have a wife and a husband and I think something that you know comes from that which is I mean it's very it's very powerful you know because having sexual relations can build up that lust like we talked about it and that lust can lead towards falling into temptation which is obviously sexual immorality something that God does not want us to do and it's very important that we don't do that he's just a flee from temptation so anything that's leading you to that temptation you must flee from like that okay let me just flirt around this line but like a run right I feel like that's be saying there is that it's not good to have the sexual relations but because of the temptation is sexual sex sexual immorality so in this case with just kissing now disclaimer everybody's different right if you're if you just pick somebody and give him a little kiss and that fills you with lust and that makes you really tempted to go deeper that's a different story you flee from that you don't do it that's a period but in in certain situations with certain people because everybody is different God is gonna convict us all the way that we need to be convicted and if I'm kissing her and not feeling that temptation or that lust to dive deeper and she's not either then it's not a temptation it's not something that we need to flee from but that's why you have to have boundaries and have just guidelines on what is okay and what is not an understanding between the two to make sure you're both on the same page with that so not to say we disagree with that at all some people definitely need the boundaries of no kissing at all and I think that's a beautiful thing for us personally kissing does not lead us to any kind of temptation and that is the only reason why we feel okay with it is because we're not convicted and it has not led us into any temptation I also yeah a lot of questions know about kids and have we talked about like when we want to have kids we have how many kids do you want I don't know if I thank you we've talked about it um I don't know exactly but I me I think the reason number yeah right I think you said that too yep probably three yeah and unless it wins unless we're twins yeah he wants to boys for sure yeah I want boy girl boy I have three sisters no girl there's always wanted a brother and I think it's really cool to have as assist as a girl to have an older brother and a younger brother I would prefer two boys first and then twin girls no not those two curls out Wow cuz I would like her to have a that's what I'm like maybe for okay so forth oh and then we have twins I'll go for okay and we've talked about probably at least two years after were married to three years that number drops yeah I think we said like five years we talked to my joke they said Jesus started his ministry at 33 so I'll start my family ministry at 33 okay I think after being married for about three years maybe that's not trying okay but we have no idea what marriage is gonna be like yeah I'm excited to have kids yeah I can leave yeah we can clean I like this what was Kyle's point of view did he want a relationship or was that not a priority in his life I've been a huge with relationships I love relationships and very relational and I always seek after a relationship and then over the last two years when I got accounted by Jesus started diving into him the relationships went out the window it was just about Jesus and I and no one else that's it period and then I got to the point where I felt like God was actually calling me to stay single for the rest of my life and the hidden be my only relationship I think it's a unique thing I got that right but there's certain people and they don't get married they just stay single and their relationship is with Jesus their whole life living for him as we do anyway but with no other relationship and I did that for about probably six months of solid conviction just like convinced that that was gonna be the way it was gonna be and I think God gave me that though so I would die just extremely intentionally and deep in the relationship with him distracted no distractions Adam so yeah like I would like meet other girls and I got other girls come with me to go so-and-so is interested in you and I'm just like I'm married to Jesus like that was my answer and I was honest about I was serious there is no question in my mind that I was gonna get a relationship Durr about six months of that guy started opening my heart back up to relationships my foundation in him was getting a you know more founded more concrete so I started opening back up to it and then started getting excited about it again and that led to the dating apps cuz I was like you know what maybe there is somebody out there for me so I started looking I started searching did not work it did not work so I I just realized you know I was trying way too hard to like find this person and yeah I just got to this point where I realized that this isn't going to work so I stopped searching I think I stopped searching more so about four months before meeting you yeah I think that's what it was and then I stopped searching and I just do it out the window again I was like you know what god if there is somebody out there you're gonna you're gonna bring them to me and I'm gonna find them at the right time when you went on the cruise where you open to relationship but you're just waiting yeah I was extremely open but very patient I was not looking at all I told him when I'm ready and my foundation is complete when I complete but like my foundations set and solid in you bringing back in the business and relationships that's a great prayer to pray if you are in a single season is to pray that God will bring you back into relationship when your foundation is solid first until then don't even like ask about relationship or seek relationship and just trust God that he will bring you out of that season when you have a solid foundation and when you're a future partner has a solid foundation because you might be ready but you should start praying for your future hubby because he might not be yeah start praying now like right now every day were you open to relationship yeah I remember I got on the ship and Britney the bride was talking to me in faith which is her sister-in-law and we were both talking about how we were in a season of singleness and Britney is like well who knows maybe you'll both like meet your husband's on the ship and faith was like oh no like I know I'm not supposed to be in a relationship and I was like well I'm open to it I think I talked about that more in that dating apps video that's the only reason why I was trying the dating apps because I felt like God was opening me up back to a relationship I just thought it was gonna come when I moved that I came sooner God's timing that reminds me of another question did we pray for your future spouse in advance and this is kind of a cool story so you started praying for me and I think it was all yeah I think it was around August of 2018 is when I started praying for my future wife mm-hmm and it's so crazy because at that time like August September I was actually in a relationship that wasn't centered around God and I was having so much conviction and conflicts in that and it was during that time when he started really praying for me that I ended things with that that person yeah crazy yep and I like went back through my journal and like the timeline is exactly it matches up exactly as soon as he started praying for me that's when I started getting heavy conviction to end the relationship so so much power in therapy yes so definitely encourage you to do that I was praying but I wouldn't say I was praying very diligently sorry babe just one prayer here in there yeah one for prayer there yeah a lot of people are asking when we're getting married the month of the wedding we're getting married in October of 2020 God willing as long as everything settles down by then if you're not praying for this coronavirus to go away start praying start praying we all need to come together in unity to pray against this thing how did you deal with passing up other awesome Christian men in the process of finding Kyle and I think we can also flip out on you as well it was actually really funny because God guarded me pretty heavily I was like I think I'm a great catch and literally nobody asked me out no one was trying to pursue me I was very single and I was around a lot of single young adults and like no one was pursuing me so God helped in that and then the couple people like maybe one or two people it got just like gave me a lot of clarity and like timing never was right not kissing anyone unless I knew I was gonna marry them so since that kind of went out the window like kissing was off the table I knew I wasn't gonna have that intimacy with someone unless they were my husband so I wouldn't really entertain Boal who i didn't think we're gonna be my husband because i wasn't craving that physical miss with somebody does that make sense okay no no you had a lot of women approaching you so how did you deal with that yeah I mean God protected me in the same way you know maybe a different way but the same kind of way like I said for when I first came to him he had me push relationships just out the window you know they were on the back burner wasn't even a thought so and then he like gave me this conviction that I was never gonna get married just be in love with him for the rest of my life which I still end and will be but only him through that it really protected me from a lot of things that I probably would have stepped into you know I probably would have just been like why not let's give it a shot you're a godly woman I'm a godly man let's let's see if it works same thing with you it's you know no sexual contact like I wasn't kissing anybody I wasn't even thinking about it no dates nothing like that just trying to build the kingdom in and giving God everything that I had so he protected me in that way through like my obsession and my obedience to him and then you know there were times where like with the dating apps and here and there like towards later down the road that I started opening back up to it but even when I was opening back up to it he never gave me that that piece of just like hey this is something I want you step into when I would pray on it it would more so be the opposite like my flesh would be like this is something I could step into and he would just give me confusion I would receive confusion over it knowing that that's not from God because guy's not a God of confusion so since I never got that piece I never I never stepped into anything and he guarded my heart in that way which is amazing cuz he guarded their hearts in that way too mmhmm yeah and that's a huge thing also that health was looking at every guy and saying he has a future wife and if I'm not her I don't want to be put on this list of woman she asked if it like has to think about when she gets into a relationship with him and that was such a blessing for me that you refrained from all that because now when I go to his visit his hometown and meet people at his church I know he doesn't have a romantic history with any of them you know and that's a blessing and if he did we would work through it but it just is it's really nice that he gave me that honor and respect even though he didn't know it in his singleness and I tried my best to do the same like when you meet people it's like I'm not around a bunch of people who I've gone on dates with or kissed or whatever you know yeah so it is there's a lot of keys yeah it's a lot of it's a huge blessing in a way to honor your future marriage when you don't even know who you're marrying yeah and on our other people's marriages as well in what way does Kyle intentionally display being the leader of your relationship I think some of the biggest ways is initiating prayer always praying over me encouraging me to seek God as of lately I think it was like a transition for you to kind of step into leadership and really figuring out what it means to lead to people instead of just yourself big difference yeah so we actually talked pretty recently like how I want that to like that aspect of our relationship to grow and since we had that conversation you really stepped up in prioritizing time we sent spend together in the word and yeah just encouraging me to go deeper different ways thanks love you're welcome bit yeah it's easy leaving yourself with Jesus and once somebody else comes in the picture is not just about you anymore and I didn't think it was gonna be as hard of a transition as it was yeah but it's it's amazing cuz he's just grown me in new ways and helping me to surrender new ways to be that person not just for me but for you too and yeah that's amazing it's definitely a process it's a growing journey but it's fun patience and grace yeah yeah you guys have a premarital counsellor yes we're going to premarital classes they just started last week and it is 13 weeks and their phone we can show them I'll insert the book that we are going

love you what's up guys welcome to today's video I have been getting some questions about what I do for work and social media management in general so I thought I would do a video kind of sharing a little bit behind the scenes of tools I use a behind-the-scenes of a photo shoot which will be later in this video so definitely stay tuned that was so much fun I wanted to actually start off with the most important part if you want to work in social media management and that is having good tools to organize your content and post your content so if you guys didn't know I've been working in social media since really when I was in college I started interning for social media and then right out of college I got a job managing a company's social media I have used a ton of different social media tools like scheduling tools and it makes the biggest difference I don't know any company who doesn't schedule out their content and is just doing it by hand because if you think about it if you had to manage like five different clients social media and how do you manually go and post for them each time it would be such a hassle sorry the lighting has been just so much fun so with that being said I wanted to give you an inside look of the social media management tool that I use which is Appy they are an amazing social media management tool they help you organize things like I said I have used a lot of different social media management tools this one definitely has the most features it has everything that I look for in a social media management tool and then some like the bonus so I'm going to show you kind of how I use it one big thing that I love is that it is available on and and on your desktop okay so one of the most convenient parts about Appy is their app so you can do everything right from your iPhone they also have a desktop version which is awesome and I'll get into that in a little bit but let me just show you how I use the app to schedule so this is the app right here import from my camera this is the next photo I want to post so you can add edits to it in here then you can write a caption it has a history you can save captions let's say you get some inspiration or you know you need to promote something for your client however you don't have the content to go with it or the graphic to go with it you can just save your captions and they also have a suggested hashtag which is awesome a really cool thing that I have never seen in an app like this before is they have this keyboard option okay if you go under a you can access all these other fonts and this is actually what I do on my Instagram stories and I have like a whole extension plugged in down here but I think it's really cool that they automatically have it an app because I can't even access these like this gothic one is a paid font I can add cool symbols it's all right there so I'm just gonna say that another awesome feature is I can tag things so if I was wanting to feature my outfit I can tag them right here this is actually thrifted so I don't need to tag anything but for the sake of it I'll just show you how it would maybe I can tag Goodwill mm-hmm it will easy heck yeah I can also add the location of where the photo was taken okay this is a feature I've never seen on any other social media management tool so you can actually put what you want your first comment so a lot of people utilize the first comment to add hashtags so if you are doing this for your client this is an amazing feature if I were to use hashtags I could go in here and the awesome thing is they suggest some so you can kind of see what they have another really awesome thing is you can add a product you're just your Instagram just needs to be hooked up to your store I'm not a store account so that's why it's not working for that so the coolest part and what saves you so much time and why apps like these are so important is because you can schedule out everything in advance if you don't utilize scheduling tools you are gonna be constantly on your phone if you're working in social media management cuz imagine having five clients and needing to post five times a day and having to do it manually another really cool feature that I like is they tell you the best time to post for your specific audience and that usually takes some dive you got to dive into some analytics and over time you can kind of gauge what time works best for the audience but Appy does it for you so that is amazing so they're suggesting if I want to post this tomorrow I'd either do it in the morning 140 or 330 this is also great if your client is in a different time zone or let's just say you don't wake up early enough to post when they suggest or when the best time is like maybe the best time is that 6 a.m. and you sleep til 8 this does it that's really cool I didn't even know they had this feature you can add an advertiser so if you are in the social media like influencer world and you partner with a brand you can add their email add in the payment information dang that is really cool this is really great if you want to keep everything like more cohesive you can move things around in the dragon drop preview that looks good and then I can just go in and schedule all these when I have time some other features they have on the app is scheduling out Instagram stories which is really cool and also IG TVs you can upload it straight from here this is a really awesome tool so if you guys are interested in downloading the app I'll have a link in the description I believe I have some kind of code to get you a discount so if you're interested in using this app definitely download it I would highly recommend it over all the other ones I have tried and used and trust me I have tried a lot let's get into more behind the scenes of what I do for work we're going to do a little photo shoot for a truly blessed Jules next so onto the second part of this video right now I'm working with truly blessed Jules they have amazing jewelry actually this cross that I'm wearing now is from them so highly recommend them but I am doing some photography and photo styling for her jewelry and her website photos we're revamping their website and just putting up a bunch of new photos that are more cohesive so right now I'm shooting all of them and then I will be editing them uploading them cropping them all in the same proportion so it looks really cohesive I have to shoot all of these pieces I'm using all these props most of which that I got from the thrift store so I'm just taking one at a time and kind of setting it up on a similar clean background so this is one setup that I have been doing and then sometimes I will put in this record and then shoot the piece of jewelry on here another thing I like to do is work with the shadows of this as you can see it kind of creates a cool shadow and then I'll lay the jewelry here and shoot it like this so I think this looks pretty good I'll probably try to shoot it without these plants so more just like that kind of view here is the next setup I just turned the pages they have like these beautiful illustrations inside so this is gonna be the next shot just shooting this right now hello it is a new day I have sat down to edit the photos so I have imported them all into Lightroom that is what I use to edit my photos it's the most efficient thing ever I like about the program for my computer which is so much more convenient when you're editing a ton of photos so I thought I would show you guys kind of my editing process so once I get these all edited I will export them add them to the shared album which is a great tool if you're working in social media is the iCloud just shared album so that's what I do for my other client who is kind of like a long-distance client so they just upload things to the shared album and then from there I can download them to my phone and post them on social media two very different clients one has an in-house photographer this client in particular is local to Arizona and she needs help with photography so it's really up to you as a social media manager which Avenue you want to go to go to if you want to be more full-service in offering like photography and content creation or if you prefer to be more hands-off in that area and you can find a business that has someone like that in-house that also really awesome - I do enjoy doing like the photo especially when it comes to this kind of like cool jewelry and photo styling that I find that super interesting so I like it both ways well I am in Lightroom this is one of the photos I'm editing I just clicked on this back commander this is what look like before so once I get kind of a preset and look that I like I can copy and paste the settings onto all the photos and then tweak it's depending on the lighting so let me just go through the next one I do it from scratch another thing I do is have to like pull through the images so I'm going to mark this with an X because it's a bit overexposed this lighting is a little bit better so the presets I'm using for this particular client are the JJ lovely ones I actually also use these on my Instagram   number for everything looks pretty good to me however I'm gonna drop shadows a little bit also the exposure okay that changes things I'm gonna drop the exposure and then pick up the shadows again and this one's a really easy one it's just kind of like a to click shot and then I'm going to crop it to the photos we want for the website and that one is pretty much good to go so from here I can literally press the man C copy basically all the adjustments I just made so now I'm going to go into the develop tab press command we've literally just pasted all those settings this lighting is a little bit different so I'm gonna go back up to one of these photos as you can see as I reject them they kind of black out these are all the photos I've edited so far so I'm gonna go to this one that had this similar set up and he's not loving settings so I like this reset it pasted on these otherwise there we go I really like the color needs a lot better there's a profit you want a little bit more control you can click on any of these settings and use the plus and minus keys to make adjustments so I think this one might feel a little bit too warm but if I were to slide it back and forth I want to have as much control this way I can move it Lily number buffer   I just walked down the street to the park to do a little work luckily Kyle has this like portable Wi-Fi thing she's super handy that is one thing about working in social media if you can work from home it's amazing however I don't work very well from home so like I was saying I don't really work very well from home I get distracted pretty easily so I typically will go work at coffee shops a lot but with everything that's going on coffee shops are closed and they're just suggesting that we don't go out so today I decided to just walk to a park and sit at a park bench alone it's pretty empty there didn't come in contact with anybody so that is just what I'm doing and yeah this little thing is awesome guys have any other questions about working in social media or other tools I use let me know thank you again to appiy for sponsoring this video you guys can download the app at the link below alright guys I love you so much have an amazing day right hello everyone welcome back we are here we are here we are here with part two there were so many questions and we're really enjoying answering them all yeah great questions so we wanted to do a work too so let's get into it we left off with the question what has been our biggest fight a juicy one you know one thing I noticed is couples rarely share specifics of their fights which I mean to each their own obviously some degree of privacy is required sure however I think if you truly have forgiven and moved on from what happened in that you should be able to share those experiences because they're so helpful like this getting into specifics is so helpful for other people it's powerful so we're gonna tell you specifics of our fights for sure she loves the details yeah that's another thing I don't call them fights I always call it conflict because I feel like a fight insinuates that we're on opposite teams like fighting against each other and that's one thing through couples Bible studies is like we are not each other's enemy on the same team we're on the same team and if there is any spirit of jealousy and security anger we know that's not from God so it's really us fighting that spirit and looking at conflict as spiritual warfare and not fights with my significant other has been huge for me so yeah I don't call them fights I call them conflict do you remember what they call it they intentional no intense this fellowship yeah yeah intense fellowship fellowship right first scenario was we were at church and they did an altar call and I had gone up to get prayer and I had intended to walk over to a young woman and then I saw this other girl heading towards her so then in that moment I just went to a young male for prayer that really hurt Kyle and it was that was a moment where I should have asked myself like what I want Kyle to be receiving prayer from a woman around our age would like how would this make Kyle feel and I failed to do that so when we left you were very hurt and upset yeah I didn't think I would be I don't think when I look at it from an outside perspective it's really a big deal but being in it it was it was hard to watch it was hard to like just kind of sit there a lot of thoughts a lot of past experiences with exes and you know being cheated on and stuff like that started coming in my heart started getting really heavy I started feeling like I was actually getting cheated on you know how questions started coming in of well maybe you're not good enough to be praying for her and she doesn't want you praying for her so she needs to go to this guy and have him pray for her like you know and I started asking well why wouldn't she just had me pray for her I do pray for her you know what's the difference between his prayer my prayer and all these thoughts started coming to my head and like the enemy started using it like big time and they started becoming these lies of like I'm not good enough I know I'm not leading her well enough she can't put her faith in me she doesn't trust me she doesn't want me to pray for her so I kind of just shut down to be honest and this wasn't right on my hat behalf because in that loan in instead of partnering with God I started partnering with these lies I started partnering with these feelings these emotions and that's not who God is those are our feelings and emotions God is much bigger much different I took it out on her where I started just getting really upset really emotional and then that led us to a silent car ride oh well not silent like a car I have no conversation because she asked me what was wrong and I was just like nothing and like shut it down so what we start driving back she turns to music on just starts worshipping and like singing and that fresh didn't it frustrated me even more because now I'm at this point of like you know she would she doesn't you know she doesn't care that I'm hurt and now she's just gonna sit here and sing and act like everything's okay which once again the enemy who is just really just yeah and that's like a huge thing to realize is if these thoughts because someone also asked like if we have doubts and stuff and so you have to realize that some of these thoughts that come in especially during conflict aren't gonna be from God because that's when the enemy has the most power he can take advantage of us being hurt because we hear his voice stronger when we're hurt because we're not in alignment with God and we're not trying to cling to truth we're trying to cling to that and so that's something to really pay attention to during your conflict with your significant other what thoughts are popping into your head and are those from God in my perspective during all this time I it was an amazing service I felt like I got really filled up from the service so I knew something was wrong and I went to the bathroom and just started praying and I just asked God to help me through this because I knew I had to stand in the gap here because I knew the enemy was gonna get in here in your head and then that's why in the car I put on the music started worshiping to try to stay in that place really keep shielding myself filling myself up so I could be stronger for the both of us because I knew you were getting attacked yeah I couldn't surrender the feelings and emotions that I was receiving so I couldn't talk to her with a clear conscience and a clear mind and a sound mind so we couldn't even have like a conversation on it which is why it turned into intense fellowship all right I think we got back and he left that's when he went back home and then we met back up yeah I left a little I was gonna say I left for a while and then I walked back which is something we learned in a couple's Bible study was that it's never okay to walk away from a conversation intentionally with like it being I'm done with this I'm out yeah but if it's like super emotional and you think we both need time to like process and pray it's okay to step away and be like okay tonight we're gonna talk about this in a little bit so I think we had like an hour and a half to ourselves it's funny because I walk back in house I was walking up she walks out and that's when we decided that we're gonna take a walk and try to figure this out which is another thing don't go on walks while you're fighting yeah it's very easy to walk away from one another on your wall won't faster slower look at each other eventually where I was like okay another another thing that someone told us was sit on the same piece of furniture so we got to a bench where neither of us could kind of like create physical distance you guys want us to give you a video of all our tips and conflicts argument tips right I feel like we've learned and I've tried to find it a lot of them so far as though and they've been really helpful and then I mean we came to a resolution when we were on the bench looking at each other and we were talking I had it was prayer and that's the thing I kept trying to initially pray prayer and I can tell when Kyle like when the enemy is trying to take hold of him because Kyle resists I shuttle yeah I struggle to pray when I'm not partnering with God and it's like wild because from outside looking in you know you're like you're not partnering with God but like in that moment inside looking out I was like well I am partner with God you know is so like stubborn and it's so crazy I mean spiritual warfare there is very real guys you know and like she was saying beginning like it's not a battle of flesh and blood but a spirit and when you're so focused on the flesh like I was so focused on her and I was mad at her and I was thinking about her not God but if I was focused on him we could have came together to fight that spirit right but I was just not partnering with him and I was deceived to believe that I was in that moment so when she told me I wasn't like I'm even more mad at her and it says fellow she was grew but it's also very hard to call somebody out and be like you're not on my side right now like the enemy is lying to you like those those things are hard to say they're very bold things to say when you're in the middle of something and someone's angry with you but one thing you can do is initiate prayer and even though Kyle would get stubborn I would just feel like we need to pray because I knew if Kyle spoke out loud to God you can't be like partnering with the enemy and praying at the same time so that was like my spiritual weapon was like get Kyle into prayer yeah that's powerful man it's good so then we started praying and then finally started opening up a little more put a timer on and then a timer on because in a previous argument Kyle became very frustrated with how long things were taking feeling like we were repeating things go going over the same things over and over again not not getting any not getting anywhere so what we discussed was okay we'll put a 20 minute timer on and if we don't feel like we've and then that'll be a checkpoint for us where have we gotten any closer to this have we gotten to closer to resolution so for this instant I put a twenty minute timer on that's a little bit harder for you is to flip that switch of like love back on takes me more time to just be like oh I'm sorry I forgive you okay we're good it's like okay I'm sorry like I am and I do I forgive you but like I need a little bit of time here okay I need to I need to take some time for myself with God to get back into the right state of mind yeah when I hear I'm sorry and I forgive you like I expect you to be all over me kissing me again hugging me and like relax and back to your normal self like when I hear those words that's what I expect so when he's still a little bit cold to me I don't feel like I have been really like forgiving yeah you get frustrated with me and you love me and I'm like I have I do I just need I want to get more just flip the switch yeah of course I do you know it's something that this is how God is starting to refine us and help us come together as one and you know giving us that that new life in a way of that like never-ending love unconditionally and just like transforming into more like Jesus when we do pray during conflict I always try to pray and thank God during it for what he's doing and what he's gonna use this particular conflict for how we can use it in the future to help others so I always thank him in the midst of it because I know it's gonna make us stronger it's gonna help us better understand each other we're gonna be able to share with people like you guys so you guys can navigate conflict and learn from our mistakes because a lot of times you can be in the middle of conflict and be super frustrated that you're there but really it's within these conflicts over the past like a month or two that have gotten our relationship a lot stronger and although it's frustrating to be in it if you're in it and can still thank God for it and realize that it's gonna be used in the future it makes the conflict a lot worth it like you know what you're fighting for yeah and I mean every painting problem has purpose God uses it all he's our Redeemer so you can't look at and be like you know this is just terrible you know cuz in it it's it's just terrible mm-hmm but if you see it more from God's perspective like all right this kind of really sucks right now but God's gonna use this and he's gonna grow us through this and it helps you to overcome these things a lot easier a lot quicker and just to keep them from becoming like detrimental mm-hmm and I think just with this one you know something that really helped at the end too was we started talking about okay like what could have we done differently and going back and reflecting on like okay where can we both improve right you know and like talking about okay well then also like with the praying like what makes you comfortable what makes you uncomfortable like would it make you uncomfortable if you know I went and prayed and had some other girl trained for me or I was praying for these other women you know and like dabbling like boundaries in this way right so we can prevent it from happening again this same situation from happening again but then also going through during conflict what was what went wrong right and what we can do better yeah so reflections huge - you know really going back and getting on the same page with it all I think this whole video is just gonna be about conflict so we - we'll share the other one yeah I mean yes I think with this one I was expressing to her the thoughts that were going through my head because you know things were getting shaky with business and finances and for me that's always been like kind of a stronghold in my life is finances and it was in a way of not like complaining or frustration more so in a way of just say processing why is this not happening the way that I feel like it should be happening and I was breaking it down to like well the only explanation I could come up with is that God doesn't want it to happen you know he's he's holding holding me back from it for some reason probably to protect me I don't know I started kind of just processing that and like I was talking about other people in the company and how are they doing what I'm doing and getting the results they're getting and she brought up well maybe are you comparing yourself to them that question like well are you just comparing yourself and that kind of got me frustrated because I was kind of speaking to just process and I guess looking for her to understand and just kind of back me and support me on it not so much to get like question or solutions for it because I didn't feel like I was looking for a solution how it's just you didn't want me to help us process deeper at all or like question what you're saying you just wanted me to be like okay yeah okay I could see that maybe that is it that is when the enemy enter I said oh I speak too much yeah like I just shouldn't I shouldn't talk that I just started to talk it out I'm just like come on kid that's just how it felt once again emotions right it's like emotions aren't really our friend mm-hmm okay they're not like our emotions are a very powerful tool that the enemy can use to deceive us and make us believe and think things that aren't from God but because they're so strong in our emotions we believe that they are from God or we believe that it is fact yeah it's truth no questions about it because I feel so strongly about it and we just have to be very careful with that be aware of the power that emotions can have on our lives which could affect negatively our you know relationships and blessings that God has put in her life so then basically at that point we were able to surrender our emotions I really start to like let go of the emotions that were driving us and influencing us and kind of come to a point of just letting it go there's a sermon by Stephen Friday that's who did it right and he has this visual of building a fence and basically when you are offended by a significant of you get handed this piece of wood and over time the devil wants to really dig in that piece of wood and create a fence between you and your significant other will have the full sermon link below so you guys can know what we're referencing in relationship it's really learning how to drop those offenses as fast as possible so I think that night we kind of just were like reasoning with each other like okay can we just let it go just let this one go drop it ya know move on yep it's a little bit hard for me because I'm fine talking for hours but I really do want to feel loved by the end of the conversation and something God has been showing me is I don't necessarily need that love from Kyle all the time I can have my love and reassurance from God until Kyle is ready because like he said snap out of it and flip the switch and that makes me want to keep talking about it because I want to get back to that point of feeling loved and connected but God has been showing me that I don't necessarily need that because I get like God is my source so that night I was like you know what I might not feel like he totally is in love with me and we're at like the best place but we should just go to bed so drop it yeah so that's what we did I went home we slept on it came back the next morning we had some breakfast yeah at that point we were able to really reflect on it without the emotions mm-hmm and kind of dig a little deeper and figure out what was really going on and see the lessons that we were learning throughout it yeah and that was when we came to the conclusion that next I just need to listen and not really give solution or maybe you just ask him are you looking for solution right now do you want to hear my opinion on it or you know do you just want me to listen and really just ask him in those moments like what do you need my behalf just learning how to respond to her and how to speak to her the way that she needs to be spoken to know the way that she craves you know wants to be spoken to give her the love that she deserves even in those moments or it's like regardless of how I'm feeling and what's going through my head remembering like the main thing keeping the main thing the main thing which is you know God in her you know my love for them and how important that is to me and even through the mists of that being able to come back and show that once you are self aware of what you need it's so much easier to communicate to your significant other exactly what you need during those moments and if your significant other is on your team they should be willing to hear that and what Kyle said he is striving to grow in that because he loves me and he's on my team and he wants me to still feel loved during conflict hangy I am editing the hijo you're watching I feel like this keeps happening but you know editing Cayenne is a whole she's a vibe you know so here I am letting you guys know that I have no idea where the last clip went of us kind of wrapping things up and saying goodbye so I just thought maybe me myself would suffice in saying goodbye because I don't have Kyle here so he can't say goodbye to you but I think he would want to say that he loves you so much and you were treasured by God and that if you would like you can subscribe and give this video a thumbs up so we will see you guys very soon love you hello I am so excited to be back with another video I am bringing the single diaries back I know a lot of you guys and girls are still in a season of singleness and I'm not even married yet so technically I am still single - but God has been just revealing so much through my relationship and my engagement about singleness and I wish I could go back and tell myself these things so I'm gonna kind of start a series of things that I wish I knew when I was single and things that I wish I knew earlier I guess - basically more talking about preparing for marriage now that God is bringing me through this whole new season of life where I am stepping into marriage and preparing for it and kind of what he's doing in me and I wanted to share that all with you in our single Diaries videos so we are back I need to take off this Fitbit because I think it's so ugly the first thing I want to talk about in my single Diaries is marriage itself and what it actually is because marriage is not what you think it is and it's not what I thought it was either and I think if we can grasp this concept in our singleness we would understand a little bit more about what we are craving if you guys haven't been here before my name is cayenne I make a lot of videos related to my faith dating relationships now stepping into marriage I also make other videos more so like lifestyle and things like that I also will have a get healthy with me series and wedding stuff on my channel as well so if you guys would like please subscribe to my channel I would love to have you guys have a lot of exciting things coming up in the future I have some notes down and a lot well they're mostly all Bible verses okay if I could go back and tell myself something when I was single it is this being single is easy Wow being single is so nice it's so easy it's great time Wow it seriously is being single is so easy now that I am in a relationship I often think back and I'm like wow my life was so much easier when I was single now that is not to say that I wish I was single I just want to get into what the Bible says about marriage and what God says about marriage so we can really understand what we're asking for so the first verse we're gonna look at is Ephesians 5:22 and it says wives submit to your own husband's as to the Lord so what exactly does that mean basically we're supposed to be submitting to our husbands as we submit to God well what does submitting to God even look like I mean submitting to God really is dying to ourselves it is telling our flesh no turning away from our sins and running in the opposite direction it's humbling ourselves before God and hearing what he has to say it is turning away from all of our worldly desires that is what it means to submit to God and that is what God calls us to do in our marriages we are supposed to fear and love the Lord so what is love what does it mean to love God and what does God tell us about love so let's go to Romans Romans 12:10 says be devoted to one another in the love honor one another above your so essentially when we are stepping into marriage we are stepping into a relationship that resembles our relationship with Christ God asks us to love others above ourselves it is the same in marriage you are called to love your husband above yourself and just speak on love a little bit more first Corinthians 13 you know love is patient and kind great love it all but one verse I don't hear a lot is thirteen seven love never gives up never loses faith is always hopeful and endures through every circumstance so marriage is about love being in a relationship means dying to yourself and your sins every day and having a person in front of you act as a mirror to reflect your sins and imperfections on a daily basis when you are single you don't have that much accountability you have your interactions with your family and your friends and strangers but a significant other literally acts as a mirror and shows you all your imperfections and it is a lot of work when I was single I did not realize what I was asking for I was craving relationship and now that I have stepped into it I realize how much work it is and how stretching it is and it is a beautiful thing because it's supposed to represent how we stretch for God how God stretched us how God refines us he does the same thing when you were preparing for marriage and when you were in marriage but I really want you guys to soak this in because I get messages all the time about how do I deal with this season of singleness enjoy it and use it as a time to prepare for this next season and how do you do that you become a servant you practice humbling yourself you practice dying to yourself these are the ways you prepare for marriage you learn how to love like Jesus loved to get into that a little bit deeper on a men's perspective Ephesians 5:25 says husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her okay let's think about Jesus what did he do for us what did he do for the church well Jesus was a servant Jesus died for us let's look at Philippians 2:5 3 the main points I see in it is one that he made no reputation for himself it wasn't about him he was a servant he was literally a king and he became a servant for the church for us and he was obedient to the point of death this is what God is calling us in 2 John 13 4 through 17 is when Jesus washes his disciples feet again it is becoming a servant Jesus was a servant he has plenty of examples of servanthood selflessness he literally died the most gruesome painful death on the cross for us and that is how God asks husbands to love their wives mark 10:45 for even the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many so I just want you guys to take all of this in marriage was one of the first things God created and he wants our marriage to resemble Jesus's relationship with us what did Jesus do his whole life was his life lovey-dovey and romance no Jesus his life was filled with strong connections with other believers it was filled with sacrifice servanthood and eventually it was dying a very painful death there are just times where me and Kyle are in conflict if I have to pray to God to give me the strength to Humble me to you know fill me with love and compassion and peace and you know sometimes I still get upset and I still get angry and irritable and all of those things and there are times when Kyle is upset and I literally have to die to myself and what I want and being right and I have to let it all go because that's what God calls us to do and it is not easy it is not easy this is one of the hardest things I have ever done and marriage will be one of the hardest things we ever do because it was modeled off of Christ's life do we think his journey in life was easy no he literally died for us and that is what marriage is it's going to yourself so everyone romanticizes relationships I know I did when I was single I just thought it was gonna be butterflies and rainbows all the time and don't get me wrong it is so rewarding because at the end of it you look more like Christ that is the most rewarding thing ever and it is filled with amazing moments and romance and happiness and smiles and laughs it is filled with all of those things and I'm not even married yet but like being in relationship is filled with all of those things so don't get me wrong I'm not saying that marriage isn't a blessing it is but the real reason it's a blessing it's because it challenges us to die to ourselves even further to submit to God even further that we have this partner beside us who is imperfect as well and we have to love them regardless of their imperfections and through that we also have to learn how to keep going to God and not this partner because even though I had Kyle he is imperfect he does get angry he does get irritable he is stubborn sometimes and I have to know that even in those moments I still have to love him I still have to treat him with love and kindness I'm supposed to learn that what he does should never turn my love off because I need to be in constant connection with God and getting all my love from him because Kyle isn't perfect Sam goes for me I am imperfect when we're single we see all of these couples and we're just we idolize it we think it's gonna be something that it's really not because no one online is airing their arguments and how challenging it is to die to yourself and surrender to yourself and to forgive someone for the rest of it you're like you are gonna be married to someone and that is the person that you are going to argue with the rest of your life that you are going to have to forgive the rest of your life I just want to be honest this past few months have been so stretching humbling and just hard and again I don't want you guys to think like this is some scary horrible thing at being in relationship is no fun because obviously you guys see us we do have fun and we love each other a lot and he is such a blessing and it's such a blessing but I think we just focused so much on that so much of like the easy parts of relationship when everything feels good that we don't focus on like the true purpose they're put in place to grow us I just awoke to this over the past couple weeks I was so naive I didn't understand what it really meant to prepare for a marriage or to be married I didn't understand what marriage was I had this unrealistic expectation I I would think about marriage and think about what I was gonna get out of it that's what it is when I was single I would think about marriage and be like oh like it's gonna be romantic my husband's gonna surprise me and we're gonna make love and have babies and we're gonna travel together and he's gonna surprise me with flowers and we're gonna go out for romantic dinners and all of this stuff not once when I was single did I look at marriage and think about all the things that I was giving to my husband and that is what marriage is it's thinking about all of the things that you are going to give to your partner it's about being selfless so right now if you're in a season of singleness and you're thinking like oh my life would just be so much better if I wasn't in this season or if this man came along don't think about it in a sense of what you're gonna get from another person think about relationship as what you need to give to someone else it's like your relationship with Jesus times two because you get to do that with God and then you get to do it with another person God is perfect the other person will not be and so it's a lot harder to be a relationship with an imperfect human than it is to be in relationship with God so get your relationship with God in check and then really pray on this and realize that what you're craving so badly you're only craving it because you're thinking about yourself and what you're gonna get out of it well what if I told you you're not gonna get anything and you just had to look at marriage as a opportunity to serve someone else for the rest of your life how exciting does it sound now and I don't want this to be like a debbie downer thing but that is a reality and because we are close to Jesus he will have us find so much joy when you do something nice for others it feels really good and sometimes when you're being stretched it doesn't but that's the purpose like when you serve others it is meant to fill us with a joy and this something I wish I realized back when I was single because I could have prepared even more I could have practiced servanthood more I could practice being selfless more doing things when I didn't want to do them helping people when I didn't want to help them going above and beyond for others that is how you prepare for marriage is by practicing dying to yourself how fun does it sound now how many people want to stay single a little bit longer raise your hand all this to say I love Kyle I know you're probably watching this I love you so much and he agrees like both of us have had thoughts of wow life would be so much easier if we were single and we know those are not from God because God has obviously called us into a marriage those thoughts are from the devil being single is easier it is what fun is easy God calls us to walk the narrow path not the easy one so marriage is walking a narrow path it's walking the same path Jesus did at least that's what God wants it me okay I hope this video encouraged you and helped you in some way during your season I would love to hear what you got out of it in the comments or any other struggles you're having with in singleness that I can speak into now that the single diaries are back also turn on your post notifications so you get a update as soon as I post I always like to comment back with the people who are commenting within the first couple hours of me posting can also follow me on Instagram right here and everything will be linked in the description as well alright guys I love you so much I hope you have a beautiful rest you good morning and welcome to today's video this is exciting I am getting back into my get healthy with me series and this one is specifically for the wedding and just for you know general well-being I guess so I will get in to that more in depth in a second because I think the intention behind getting healthy is very very important because if you don't have a healthy intention the whole process will become unhealthy for you mentally and a lot of times physically so Kyle is on his way we have this kind of routine going which has been really so much easier to do during quarantine is to get in a new routine so we start a routine for now you wake up around 8:00 he comes over at 8:30 we walked to the park doing outdoor workout usually about 45 minutes to an hour and then we walk back and then I make us breakfast and yeah that is our routine so I guess that's the first tip is schedule out your workout schedule exactly what time you're going to be working out because like yesterday I didn't schedule at a time and we just took a rest day and I was like oh I still want to work out but I didn't schedule a time to do it and I didn't end up doing it so schedule time we are gonna head to the park you should be here at any minute just wanted to show you guys where I'm at right now this is what I'm looking like and put out a shirt get to the park school so this is our spot we can use this for long exercises and then I bring a towel I also have a resistance band   but we did forget the speaker throughout the speaker so you can play it off your nope you're gonna go for it and go for it now you do it into the camera doing it because you told me to do it I just had a take it in a little bit okay warm up right so what I have been doing for workouts is I have just been playing YouTube videos usually I'll play like to YouTube videos my favorites right now are mad fit she has a lot of really good ones that you don't need equipment for I downloaded the sweat app because they're doing a one-month free trial right now for everything that's going on so I'm doing the bikini body guide program and they said they changed a lot of the workout so you can do them at home so I'm starting week one of that I like it because it's more structured and I know what I'm doing every day and I don't have to come to the park and just like guess or search YouTube for a video I can just go on my sweat app and know exactly what workouts so I'm gonna do the first workout on there   maybe you breakfast doing omelettes with veggies in it and then a really good way to get more veggies is I just discovered just cooking up some cattle with olive oil and then I add in garlic powder and chili lime so you hear people say it all the time drink bar water stuff something I'm doing to help myself drink more water is adding cucumbers definitely makes it taste better in my opinion so if you are looking to drink more water maybe pick out a fruit to add to it just to give it a little bit more flavor I quickly wanted to share kind of like what my goals are in this healthy series with me because get healthy series with me because the last time it kind of ended with a overwhelming mental I wouldn't say breakdown but they got a little bit mentally and healthy for this series focus more on getting better shape for my wedding however just overall in general that I feel more comfortable in my body and that I have better physical fitness and I can run and just live a healthier and better life that is the goal of it and it's really because I love myself and I think that is the major key when getting healthy is doing it because you love yourself and you want what's best for yourself rather than hating yourself and working out as like from a place of hatred for your body so that is the biggest thing and biggest shift through this all is really seeing my body as a temple and trying to thank God every day that I have this temple and every time I workout I just thank God that I have this temple and that I have the ability to move it's realigning your mindset with our bodies are a gift and we should be so grateful that God has entrusted us to take care of it at the end of the day we love ourselves and that is why we want to be in great shape that is why we want to feel good in our bodies it's from a place of love so if you guys can get that down trust me this journey will be so much better for all of us overall for the wedding I have about almost 6 months now so starting as early as possible instead of doing this like crazy crunch time diet and it's really just been easing into this journey and these routines and having six months really gives me a really great amount of time to ease into everything so that is the first thing I did was just start easing in to eating healthy and honestly cooking from home has helped that so much a prayer that I've been praying is that God gives me self-control you've watched some of my other videos you know like binge eating and emotional eating is definitely something I have struggled with before so that prayer is really amazing because what I realize is our self-control doesn't really come from ourselves that is a fruit of the Holy Spirit so we can pray that God enhances us in us so that has been something that I've been asking God for more self-control when it comes to eating and cravings and I just accept that I will have thoughts about fast food and wanting a chocolate milkshake and sometimes I can have those things but I don't have to listen to every craving I can just observe the craving and the thought I'd be like okay yeah my mind says I want a chocolate milkshake right now does that mean I need to go up and go grab one No so just practicing that self-control and self-discipline and asking God to enhance that in us is another amazing thing personally the places that I would like to see changes and I don't want this if you like oh you don't love your body kind of thing because I can still love my body and want it to be better you know just because I want something to change doesn't mean I don't accept myself for the way I am I think that is a really hard thing when it comes to like everything in culture is like love your body and so like if you want something to change does that not mean you don't love your body and love yourself no not necessarily so just pray on that went a little bit but I love myself and that is the reason why I'm doing this and my personal goals are to just lose a little bit of extra fat that I know I don't need I would love for my face to slim out a little bit and then my arms in my back because that will all definitely be showing with my dress so I would love to tone these babies up and also tone my back a little bit more so those are kind of like the main goals of my journey and overall just to have more energy and feel healthier and have more confidence because I know when I workout it definitely builds my confidence not because of the way I look but because of the feeling I have after I workout and you just feel more accomplished so those are all my goals behind this series I guess and we will have more in depth chats like this because I think mental health is really important when it comes to having fitness goals and health goals so yeah I never want to leave that part out of this journey because it's honestly the center of it all give it a try Cheers have you ever had carrot juice before no supposed to eat these mmm that's tasty hmm so yummy ticket dang zip Wow so good I will have it like I think it tastes good so if you don't want it y'all pray for me it's actually not that better than the celery weird like a six a little bit over five not that okay I love it maybe I'll get there one day mmm maybe the celery is like a read it's how Kyle works out I forgot to film footage from our workout this morning besides Kyle's towel workout but I didn't work out um week one of the bikini body guide the app days which I just realized I think I have my level on beginner so all the workouts are a little bit too easy for me so I'll look into changing that but it's nice to have some kind of structure that you can go along if you're just getting into working out and then afterwards we did a video format fit and I will leave that link in the description and now we're having breakfast and I thought I would show you what we're having I have eaten most of it but I just hate scrambled eggs kale the Sam I made yesterday avocado with a little bit of this honey mustard smoothie coffee and then Kyle has some sausage as well and he's drinking his coffee out of a cookie butter cup because he likes to mix it in with like the leftovers on the bottle don't waste the past three days I have been extremely bloated like painfully bloated and that's how's it happen for a while I think it might be eating meat because I haven't really had much meat in the past three or four years and then recently I have been eating bacon sausage so the next three days I'm gonna just cut it out and see if that helps with all the bloating she needs more for me lucky I'm very excited this company reached out to see if they could send us this massage gun and it came so quick I didn't think I would get here till next week I'm so excited to try this cuz I get really tired massaging Kyle I'm just like not strong enough so now I can just zap in this thing oh but this is pretty heavy too if I can look better what do you got there kid   massage is four days   oh wow oh that's the Spicer sword my gosh guys oh yeah do it yeah this is also so much better for me 50 is a 159 or something like that no this works so nice this is so worth it good morning Happy Easter I am just getting ready Kyle literally this morning said stay here I'll be back in an hour and I have no idea what he's doing so I thought I would get ready since I have a little bit of time and honestly during quarantine I have not been getting ready much but it's always nice to dress up I figure you know if it was Easter I would be dressing up and going to church so I should dress up today so getting ready this is the elf primer I accidentally bought the wrong one this is the blemish control one and I don't like it I usually get the other green one and it just like does a really nice canvas anyway so I'm getting ready while he's gone oh I want to show you what came in the mail perfect in time for Easter I just got these in the mail they are so beautiful I don't know if you guys have seen these I've seen these

neutrals so I just went with the white ones and if you're wondering what size I got this is the passion round so this is the medium size and then they have a smaller one and a bigger one so depending

Kyle and what Kyle is doing what his big surprises alright so it is Easter happy Jesus day and it's my first Easter with cayenne and I really wanted to have some sort of tradition started right but to

money that's like only in certain places at certain times and apparently tonight only they're allowing anybody to watch it for free online which is dope so I don't know if we're sharing this tonight but people should know tonight okay so you're probably watching this a little bit later okay yeah figure out hello welcome to my first wedding planning series my first wedding my first wedding planning video in the wedding planning series so these videos are probably gonna be a little bit all over the place because I actually started planning back when I was in Illinois I'm gonna do my best about organizing them and I thought just doing it by category would be the easiest so today's video is gonna be all about picking out the venue and if it's too short I'll probably add in some other stuff I was planning long distance so I only actually got to tour one venue in person and then another venue I had my friend go visit and FaceTime me while she was there I have been getting some messages on you know planning a wedding during this pandemic um I have found that it hasn't really impacted me too much at my wedding is for October obviously I don't know how long this is gonna last but I just have to trust God that he's got a plan he's gonna see it all through if we end up having to elope and have a celebration later that's fine most of the contracts were in are all covered by you know national crisis so if they have to cancel I should be getting a full refund on everything but I'm just going through and planning as I normally would and just trusting God in the process that he'll give me just sermon on things that I don't need to book war right away or just making sure the contracts are all in place more than anything a wedding is about the Covenant you're entering with your significant other and God and the celebration an event of a wedding is really not something God tells us to do it's just something of this world so don't put so much pressure on it I mean it can easily become an idol and can just take over all your emotions and thoughts and that's not really what getting married is all about getting married is about literally becoming one with your fiance under God so yeah don't lose sight of what this wedding really is the world puts a lot of pressure on what it should be and what it should look like get back to the basics realize that this is such a gift from God and it's really not about all of these you know material things although they're such they're so fun and nice to have and like I obviously want to have a nice celebration and party but the end of the day that's not what it's really about is about you know me becoming one with Kyle and you know making that commitment in front of God so oh my arms hurt I just don't work out so let's get into the video be sure to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe and let me know in the comments if you want more wedding stuff so I'm planning a wedding and the first thing I'm tackling is the venue and my dress so I will do separate videos for wedding dress shopping but today I'm focusing on the venue I'm having my wedding in Arizona I live in Illinois so I have to plan a long-distance wedding I'm moving back to Arizona in a few months so it'll be easier once I'm there however we want to get married in the next eight to ten months and typically you want like a year to play on your wedding so I kind of needed to get a venue locked down ASAP so that is my number one priority I started doing some research on venues in Arizona luckily I actually used to work for a wedding photographer so I've been to a lot of the venues in Arizona and I'm not in love with any of them I didn't really love the experience at any of them besides one in particular and it wasn't a traditional venue it was actually at a private estate her family owned a dairy farm and they had the wedding in there like big front yard and I mean it was big it was like a big farm and the wedding part wasn't near the cows but then they got ready in their parents house they had the ceremony and reception all in the front lawn with a huge tent and out of all the weddings I've been to and that one felt the most intimate and just the most special out of all of them I kind of knew going into my wedding I didn't really want something at her too traditional venue I wanted something a bit more unique so I was on wedding wire I believe and I came across this company called cloth enflame that literally do weddings in the middle of the desert or in the middle of fields and I just thought it was like a really unique experience so I contacted them and they actually have an open house today like they set up all this stuff and you can really experience kind of like what it would be like to get married at one of their events so I actually sent a friend to go check out their open house for me and she's gonna FaceTime while she's there and just I'm gonna get to check it out virtually and she's gonna ask questions for me but just this is so cool         as you can see the flame I had a phone call with them and they sent me over a quote venue itself is all-inclusive as in they provide the tables the bathrooms the lights the sound system the plates the food they provide a lot of things however all the furniture you saw the bar the photo booths all of those are rentals and external they quoted me about $180 per person and we were planning to invite about a hundred people and that was just too much because they charge per person for everything a lot of other venues will just charge for the venue itself and then you can outsource and pick your catering and all that stuff but since its all-inclusive it was a package deal it was a bundle price if we were inviting a hundred people and that's $180 per person that just puts us at $1,800 and that doesn't include the photographer videographer the deejay it doesn't include you know all the rentals it only comes with the table so the venue itself would be pretty bland it because all it really comes with is the tables in the dance floor so if you didn't have all that other seating area it would kind of just be a little empty I also don't think it included alcohol so that price point was just way too high for us and we were really sad however I got back on wedding wire I believe or the knot and just put in outdoor venues and then we found another one and we decided to tour that one so that is what we did we didn't decide to go with the cloth and flame route just because we couldn't customize it to our budget and we were honestly trying to keep under twenty thousand dollars for the wedding itself and you know everything starting at eighteen not including everything else it was just not happening so then I'm gonna insert all the footage from the venue we actually decided on and their price points were so much better so let's get into that     so that is a so that is the bit so that is the venue we just hide it on we also considered one more but it wasn't available at all in October that is one feature on the websites you can put in the dates and you can see the calendar if they're even available so that was really helpful and like I said we didn't really want something super traditional at a resort or at a building we really wanted it outside so we absolutely loved this venue and as you can see is so beautiful on its own you really don't need much like the view is breathtaking they were actually setting up for a wedding the day before so they were like building out some things and finishing the dancefloor they were renovating the bathrooms when we were there so the whole setup was kind of a little bit messy but even in the mess we could see just how beautiful it is so we ended up picking this venue and the main difference about this venue in the price point was well it was a heck of a lot cheaper but it was in tears so for where is zero to a hundred people it was one price then from a hundred people to 150 or 200 people it was a price up the price difference I think was about nine hundred dollars which gives us so much more flexibility in who we could invite when we were looking at the first venue we were like dang we have to cut people off the list but now with this flexibility and the price then it's really not that big of a price jump it just allows us to invite a lot more people without just having to be so cutthroat I guess cuz we were getting to a point where like okay we're inviting 40 people and that's it so with this venue we can invite a lot more people our invite list is about a hundred fifty now and we'll tweak it over the next two months or so but yeah we're at 150 and we're assuming about a hundred will come and we just booked for the lower set the zero to a hundred guests and a month before the wedding if we find out that there's more than a hundred if it's just a few people they'll just charge us individually per person if it's you know I think I like 1520 more people then they have to like put us up into the next tier so love that this venue included tables chairs you have to do the bar there but they have a whole little shack as you saw so that's cool so we don't have to rent anything for them to set up it includes the dance floor the lights it comes with a fire pit and outdoor furniture for people to sit on it's just it's so beautiful the tent you saw is optional that we can add on we might do it I think it's a few hundred dollars and that's basically where the bride can get ready it's so small that I don't think me and my bridesmaids would get ready there we ended up getting an air B&B but it would be a good place for me to kind of touch up and hide before walking down the aisle it would also be a good place for me to touch up for the photoshoot like once we take pictures after the ceremony is like the first time I've gone back and looked at the footage in a while so it makes me so happy to see it again it's just so beautiful and we'll be getting married right around sunset so I'm just so excited to give you more of an idea this venue was under six thousand dollars I think six thousand was the most if you had like two hundred plus people and then I will insert some photos of the tables and chairs the Instagram is not poppin but yeah I don't really love the look of the white chairs so I am looking into alternatives and possibly renting wooden tables and benches because I think the white just really contrasts with the nature that will cost us upwards of a thousand dollars so that is definitely not something I need but I'm putting it on my want list and including in our budget cuz I think it would make the whole experience look a lot better but I can easily cut that out and just go with the tables and chairs that they have and make it work while we are on the topic of tables and rentals I quickly wanted to show you my mellow note boat board I will go into more detail about this in another video but I use this website called milla note to plan my wedding and I just love it because super visual and customizable so this is the home board I can also invite team members so my mom is on here my dad's on here everyone can access it so under my rentals these are the tables I really like I kind of you can like insert different options I can put my quotes down these are the wooden tables that I really like so I'll probably end up getting those and then I kind of just added some other things that these companies offer to give you more of an idea of what I want the whole wedding to kind of look like this is kind of like a mood board with different images on it just inspiration that I like this is really like the table said I'm going for I probably won't have these pillows but I really love just the wood table with a little bit of greenery they don't let you have like these kinds of candles lit at this venue so that's something to consider as decoration restrictions however we can have low candles lit in if they're enclosed by glass I might just have these candles there for decoration and just not light them another thing is they don't allow glassware so we kind of need acrylic plate ware to use instead I'm gonna see if I can use goblets like this because I really think they add a beautiful touch to the decor but anyway there's a little overview of the wedding planning board and like I said I'll go into more depth about this another video okay so that is all for today's video I hope you guys enjoyed it I know we didn't really tour that many venues but I thought both of them were really unique I'll definitely be making more videos I'm gonna do a whole video on florals because I decided to do this myself so pray for me and I'll have a bunch more on like decor and other planning aspects of everything so far what I have done is we have Airbnb x' book books for where the bride is saying I don't think we have a groom's one booked yet and then also the family is saying they are in the process of planning a barbecue pool day and also the rehearsal dinner at those air B&B x' so have a photographer books I have a video Aquifer who I'm planning to book but I just need to catch up with him he's a friend they are in the process of booking a caterer so yeah that's kind of where I'm at at the wedding planning process I need to book entertainment yeah I think that's like the last big thing I need to decide if I'm gonna end up doing a bachelorette party and we need to finalize guest list we're not gonna do invites just to save money but we will be sending out save-the-dates and just having everybody RSVP online so yeah that's where I'm at the process I hope you guys enjoy this video if you did give it a thumbs up subscribe to the channel and I will see you in my next video on Thursday love you guys hello welcome to today's video the plan is to surprise Kyle with a camping trip now Kyle is definitely an outdoorsman he loves hiking and camping but he hasn't really done it in a while so and we've never done it together we've gone like on maybe one or two hikes but nothing super intense I thought it would be fun to plan a surprise camping trip and literally get everything we need for it and then just like wake him up one morning and say get in the car we're going somewhere I have been looking on offer up for tents and I found one that I really liked and I got it down to $45 it probably could have gone lower I'm not good with haggling but I got it for $45 so I'm going to pick that up tonight planning this camping trip for next week literally a week from today so next Wednesday it's Wednesday today so I have about a week to get everything in order and then we're gonna go camp up in Nevada so that it will be probably like a four hour drive or so I also need to buy sleeping bags I think I want to try to get like folding chairs so we have somewhere to kind of like sit at the campsite and then yeah I think we're gonna meet my friend Courtney and her boyfriend out there so she should have like cooking stuff so I don't really need to worry about the dad too much and then I also need to figure out if I should like pack a bag for him or because I never go to his apartment I don't have a key to his apartment because I want to kind of like be surprised get in the car and then all of a sudden we're driving for like hours and he'll be like what is going on but I need him to have clothes to wear growing up I would go camping a lot but I am NOT a camping girl recently but I'm going to be a camping girl cuz my hubby's a camping guy so this wife he needs to become a camping girl you know okay I just got back and y'all I just got some deals he ended up having two sleeping bags we just started talking and he was like hey what other stuff you looking for I was I got any sleeping bags and chairs and he's like I have a sleeping bag he's like actually have two sleeping bags so I got two sleeping bags for $30 and then he's like I also had this camel back and he gave this to me for $5 okay update it is now Monday two days until we leave for the surprise I also has no idea and I've been like hinting at him to wash his clothes because he has no clothes left and we definitely need him to have clean clothes here's the update we're leaving tomorrow morning Kyle still have no idea I was trying to get him to work the last two days more because he doesn't know he's not gonna be able to work Wednesday and Thursday but he's like oh I'll just you know work less today because we're doing dinner and all this stuff and I'm like so oh well he's just not gonna be able to work as much this week and also I want to go pick up these chairs and I'm like trying to go do stuff like pick up the air mattress and the chairs but then he's home and I can't leave for like an hour and a half without him asking like where I'm going it is the morning of the surprise is about it's almost 8:00 so right now I'm just trying to get everything in my car that Kyle cannot see so I've got like pillows already and then I made my bed so he wouldn't notice that they were missing you know I'm just packing some clothes and I have to make sure I get this back to my car before he gets here he should probably be here he usually gets here around 8:30 you were like 8:20 he usually text me when he wakes up as well if he doesn't text me then I'm pretty sure he's still sleeping so and then when he gets here we're gonna like walk outside like we're gonna go work out and then I'm gonna actually get in the car and I don't know if I included the part about the chairs but my friends ended up buying chairs for us so we don't need to go pick those up anymore I think I'm gonna take him maybe to like Whole Foods and go get some like breakfast and it's like coffee and I think that will throw him off too cuz he doesn't know we need snacks and coffee for four for five hour drive he'll probably catch on to that as we're driving but I don't think I'm gonna tell him what we're doing or where we're going and he won't be able to see anything in my trunk so he'll be like why the heck are we driving four or five hours to Nevada Las Vegas I'm just excited for him to be in a surprise with me I didn't realize like how fun the anticipation is for a trip but how much more fun it is like with someone else and sharing that with someone else so keeping it a surprise it's like you only get the anticipation it's not as fun cuz you don't have someone to anticipate with but I need to really get this done before it gets here I have everything ready how has not texted me good morning so I know he's probably still sleeping so I need to give him a call he's one of those guys who were like soon as his alarms 10 times and then wake up like two hours later good morning are you awake yeah you sound away yeah will I be seeing this beautiful face yeah well I will see you soon wrong nothing's wrong with you you're a sleepy guy okay Kyle was riding his bike now I literally have thought out all the details I'm putting my car keys in my pocket so then he doesn't see me like grab from them and think we're going somewhere so those are gonna stay in my pocket it doesn't really make much of a difference if I grab my keys or not it's a matter of like 20 feet of him knowing that we're not going to work out but I don't know I like to drag out the surprise as long as possible and I've been doing like health flogs like it healthy with me so I'm going to start filming and pretend I'm doing oh where are we heading to just that morning workout in mmm actually we're not is that why you're wearing what you're wearing yeah we're actually getting in the car and going for a surprise ready for work out that's it I knew you are working on this I was looking at you I'm like those are not workout clothes you're about to get all dirty you are the crankiest surprise getter I've ever met listen woke up late but the mindset that it's gonna get a workout I was gonna go to work it's all me no workout in no work no it's something better something better so can you get excited please okay because I've been planning this for over a week yeah no yeah really yeah baby yeah all right 70 degrees out babe just go get it no no we're too close so another pair workout is gonna go in and get them cuz you make it go face wet er yeah here's some more socks it was hot and some golly ana golly vitamin because I want one okay okay I love you I love you oh my gosh he was so cranky that we were not gonna go work out this kid we have to get him out of this bad attitude I'm not letting him take away my surprise I've been working so hard on so I changed the plan and just had him go in cuz his roommates sleeping on the couch and I also don't really know where all this stuff is so I'm just having him go get it and he'll just know what's in there I still don't think he's gonna guess what we're gonna do though Sedona or flags that we're at our first stop we got breakfast luckily Cayenne keeps hot sauce in her purse and she's got a nice breakfast biscuit right there never forget about the coffee Grand Canyon update got my coffee had some breakfast butanol Pippi good got to wake up a little bit but that's me macro key okay we are about an hour and a half from my friend's house council no idea where we're going no he knows we're probably going to Vegas but he has no clue why we'd be going there he doesn't really I don't think he remembers my friend lives there hi I figured it out I know what we're done we're getting a load women epic yeah my guess is just keep getting debunked and the only place that's like an hour and a half away from us in this direction is Vegas but why would she take me to Vegas we're gonna go get crazy drunk and Gamble our faces off and lose all of our money because that's what we do is it though night now that she's out of the car let's chat shall we you know I like surprises I'm I'm all for surprises but I feel like I'm more of a surprise giver than a surprise getter like I just want to know I want to know where we're going we're just weird because doesn't sound like me I like spontaneous I like adventure and I am enjoying it but I want to know what an old man so anyway yeah she's sooo sweet and amazing and beautiful and wonderful and this is amazing I don't know so don't tell her that you can tell it it's gotta be Vegas update we are three minutes away from the destination and I still have no idea what the heck is going on we are in Nevada Nevada knew that we're Nevada Nevada Nevada a fitness center okay we're turning what are we training into what the heck did you get us a condo what are you doing she's hiding something from you guys who lives here I'm gonna film you know I miss Kyle do you remember Courtney from when I facetimed her and she we were engaged yeah when I got engaged she cried yeah yeah you had like the best reaction so he doesn't know what we're doing yet so should we reveal it you don't even know what's going on look in the trunk what do you guess together camping yeah we're going camping yep they picked a place for us to go we're going with her and Ty it's real rustic but yeah okay the camo bag gave it away awesome yeah the past week I've been going and buying like camping stuff on offer up really yeah so that's why you got the back so when I got when I was a shoot I told him I bought something on offer out I just told you I bought the backpack but really I bought two sleeping bags a tent is that what this is that's a sleeping bag there's like a tent there's another sleeping bag   but I wanna at least update the people here let them know how stinking excited I am or maybe two days potentially two days of camping out in the desert it's so much fun     you want some trail mix   show up I don't know what it means but there's a smile upon your feathers and I see something shimmering in your eyes   and they say if you want a glimpse of future needs failures and you said you put down the morning gun would you follow me too beside me the fun fear is pastor   when you look at me this way I find it hard to not give it   so the day's became weeks and fell just like the night before when you left I was set up a little hammock for you got Mountain has snow on it just took a nap     wonder why   me this way I find it hard to give oh yeah hey my mattress mattress it's beautiful so here is my old mattress I have this topper on it because the mattress itself is just like super hard I actually reached out to tempt Anita see if they would send me one because my friend has one of these mattresses and I love sleeping over at your house because they're so pretty scary well I haven't slept on it yet but just as good as I remember this is so comfy what you better than my other mattress oh it's like soft but it's not too soft they get soft but it's supportive kind of like a man should be there in Home Depot Kyle is building me a desk all right what's going on guys so today is day one of putting a desk together for cayenne so we went out to the store we got the wood that we needed we got the supplies I see how this goes   of course how'd you like it I got this debt or this chair from offer up to go with the desk and it's honestly like a really nice chair super comfortable but what the girl did not have listed was this cut catastrophe wow that is ugly she just she like reupholstered it but did like a terrible job I went to jo-ann fabrics and I found some fabric that works this is what it looks like so it's just this super neutral and then it has a little bit of texture so that's what I'm gonna use to reupholster it in the chair wanted to show you guys kind of like my bed so I actually have the bamboo sheets they're from pure fiber I would highly recommend them I love them so much they're a little bit more of an investment I think they start at about a hundred dollars once you try these sheets and then you go to like regular sheets it's just hard to go back but yeah so those are the sheets I have I'll see if I can find any similar ones on Amazon and I'll have them on my amazon store and then I don't know if you guys saw these huge pillows I got it Joanne's to put on my bed these were like $50 $50 there was 60% off so I got in for $20 each which is a really good price for pillows that bag and I just wanted to put them on my bed since it doesn't have a back board the bed looks pretty plain without with just these like right pillows on them um the pillows look really big anyone else watch sailing WA vagabond anyway back to the pillows these look really big I feel like these would be good like in the back and then pillows stacked in front of it okay that looks worse so I mean if anything I can use these to put on a couch once we move in together but I mean overall they're really nice pillows they just look so big I took my plants outside to water them but I left him in the Sun too long these ones are sunburned if you guys are plant people I gave him a little mist should I cut these leaves off because they are burnt also my little leaf tree she's a little top-heavy so right now I just have her like leaning against the wall but before she was like collapsing so do I need to put like a stake in her like that one help me also everyone recommended apophis and it is not growing at all like it's not getting longer really I wanted it to like trail down this at first I had it up here but I feel like because my fan is really high that it wasn't thriving so then I moved it closer to the window to see if that would help if it would grow is this pot like too small for it guys I need plant help and is this spot by the window gonna be too sunny I don't know I don't know I already lost one plant one plant died pillows look better kind of just like leaning with the other pillows sticking out looks just pretty cozy instead of so stiff you know okay I need to put away laundry and then I'll give you guys kind of like room tour also this is really random but Kyle ordered these he always orders random stuff off like Facebook Ads I don't know if this one was from an ad but basically he got this pillow and this is used for your arm so if we're like chilling on the couch he puts his arm under here and then I can lay on top of the pillow that way his arm doesn't fall asleep I will say this is probably one of the best random purchases he has made he always buys like the most random stuff that's where like that moon came from if you guys haven't seen on my histogram Kyle got me this moon that lights up and it says I love you to heaven and back you can get personalized and he got our faces on it and it lights up a bunch of different colors but it's dying and it looks very creepy when it lights up it's hilarious but yeah Kyle just finds the most random things to buy don't there it is okay speaking of random purchases that file may be easy this one was good this one was good this is dope this is a 360 electric toothbrush with cold light get ready for cleaner teeth and brighter smiles there's no way like that does not brush your teeth it literally just vibrates these things in your mouth that is not gonna work kind of feels good it's like a massager that's what it is it's a gum massager but there's not a new toothbrush five seconds ago you were like yeah this is definitely not gonna brush my teeth and now your drawer is tipping by it oh my god over four four five well anyway he got the staple gun so he could do the chair before he stands it only only took like a month and a half to get here first thing   I decided I'm gonna have a little bit of a crease unless you're looking for   looks like on the bottom but then we realize that somewhere there's holes up on the side and we're just going to do staples on the sides and then later I'm going to take a piece of spare fabric and cover up the staples all right so we basically have it done got this stapled together she's gonna get strips and fabric glue to cover that with some extra fabric and we just need to line it up and together take a seat do you think very puffy it's really good - okay guys I'm gonna finish the video off here but I wanted to give you guys an overview room update and it's not finished yet there I'm still waiting for a few things from Ikea which I will explain and then I'll do like a final room tour but I just so you walk in this is the new desk area this is the chair we just made where did this crease come from I swear that wasn't there before anyway that is the chair we just made up hoping it like a comfy blanket to throw over it and we're probably going to just take off this layer of paint and maybe try to bleach the wood to match the desk better rug actually came in my fabfitfun box I thought that was cool that they included that it's in their spring box and then I have my hamper in this corner which I might move into my closet I ordered a desk lamp for my Kia to go here so that one's usually on my nightstand and then I also ordered a shelf to put these records in and to like hang above the desk so and then I also ordered like a drawer organizer so all of like this stuff doesn't have to be sitting on the desk it can be put away nicely here is my future hubby that's how what the pillows look like I I like them now and just have this area a little unorganized like this and then this chair is I guess where we pile all of our stuff right now once they get that drawer organizer I can put all like those books and stuff away let me just have these hats hanging   that bookshelf and I kind of just have this set up like that some ground decoration beer and we have this plant which so sad these sunburned leaves poor guy I'm sorry literally left you out there to crisp and that is what the room is looking like right now I also want to get a new blanket that's not great because nothing in this room is gray so I'll be on the lookout for that I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you again to tough the needle for sending me the mattress I have been enjoying it so much it is so comfy I will leave the link or information about it in the description but I love you guys so much be sure to subscribe give this video a thumbs up stay tuned for my next video good morning yesterday was Monday the start of a new week for the get healthy with me I ended up doing a full body workout by Matt Fit which I'll hopefully in the description it was a 30-minute one and then I started it with a warm-up lap I didn't get any footage yesterday but but today's Tuesday and we're heading back to the park not really sure what I'm feeling like doing today one thing I am doing this week that's different is I'm doing a push week just like adding something or you can push me a little bit further so my goal for this week is to get 10,000 steps every day okay last night I was walking around the house and laps because I had 300 steps to go       so we kind of switch our work out and started just doing like partner stunting yeah haven't got this yeah we are we did not get it down yet now we're sitting down we can keep the Bible open making breakfast this is for Kyle and then I bought some meatless sausage patties from Trader Joe's now I'm cooking up some vegetables and then this is going to be in the eggs I also got the soy cheese one for ginger joke it's really good especially when it's a melted welcome to breakfast sausages me and Kyle actually had a trip planned to go to Hawaii basically we would be there right now which makes me really sad but that's okay we'll be able to go back I know and I guess this way I will just go back when we are married most likely which make it even better but I got a bunch of swimsuits from cup sheep my aunt has a pool so I think I'll be able to wear them there actually that's where I'm moving next she's basically like a second mom so she has a pool so at least they will come handy for that but I thought I would just try them on and if this get healthy with me and just throw this little bikini halton here because they're really cute I personally think they're a little bit more on the water side but if you're gonna come at me go watch my modest video okay let's all be friends here's the first one it's just a simple striped I got all of these bikinis in a medium and they will be leaked below they're nice and high-waisted this is a one-piece I really love the ruffles this is the next one it is a really cute kind of like twist on a one-piece it's kind of like a two-piece in the back but then it also covers up your whole stomach you can also just wear the top because this detaches so you could just wear this top with like white bottoms and if you look closely the material is ribbed this material is also super thick as well this is actually one of my favorites I love the sleeves I think this little cap sleeve is super cute these are a little bit out of my comfort zone like the color I tried to get it more color because we were supposed to go to Hawaii so I kind of wanted a little bit more like floral and fun and colorful but this one is so pretty I love the flowers on it and I have to show you guys the cover-ups because honestly they're my favorite things this is the first one and it's like this long cape style cover up in the website they have it styled like this so it just ties in the front and then trails in the back I'll get a better angle in the mirror okay this is the last one it is definitely not really my style but I wanted it to do something again a little out of my comfort zone but it is really pretty yeah it's definitely like a tropical vacation kind of bikini all of the bottoms are full coverage by the way the back has class and then let me show you the last cover-up which is seriously so pretty it's this super bohemian these leaves I love it this is like my bride cover-up for sure this is the length of it it has scalloped detailing if you are interested in any of these bikinis I will have them all linked in the description plus I have a discount code and all the details for the discount code will be in the description as well wanted to say thank you to cup sheet for sending me all these and sponsoring this video they have great affordable swimsuits finding bikinis that are true to size on these like affordable websites can be tricky so I'm very grateful that all of these are true to size and it's not like this guessing game that I needed to figure out but yeah if you guys are interested in any of these all the details will be linked below for lunch I'm making this sweet potato gnocchi with butter and sage it's so good that was still cooking and then I'm making these vegetables this is from Trader Joe's too so this is like really easy to throw together backups like this another thing to note is portion size so those ones for Kyle that one's for me I noticed that I was basically eating the same amount as Kyle but he's a lot bigger than me and I don't need to be eating that big of a serving hi Thorin's I wanted to talk to you guys about body and security obviously during fitness journeys this is something that will happen or might be brought up for you I was looking at those videos that me and Kyle took at the park and I was just like looking at my stomach and just feeling you know and I don't know if like embarrass but just like not happy like I had cellulite on my stomach and I guess I just like started feeling insecure about it and I started feeling a bit heavy and just kind of feeling a little bit discouraged and down on myself all of those things will happen if you are not you know where you kind of want to be physically then those thoughts can have a real hold on you so I just wanted to encourage you guys and let you know kind of how I work through that the biggest thing for me is just like acknowledging that those thoughts are there and then kind of like talking to myself in my head and be like okay you're not where you want to be and you might not like everything about your body but you love your body because this is a temple that God has given you and the reason why you are working out is because you love yourself not because you don't like yourself or you don't like your body we workout because we love ourselves and that always has to stay your main reason for working out because if you get trapped in this only working out because you want to change and you hate your body it is just so exhausting and it honestly just makes you feel like crap and I don't want that for anyone I don't want that for myself so in those moments just acknowledging like okay yeah that's not really what I would love my stomach to look like right now but at the end of the day I love myself and I my body and that is why I want to be healthier and get in better shape it's because I love myself and I have set goals for myself make me feel healthier and be able to be more active and just having a bigger reason why to keep yourself going it is the key to working out because that's what's going to keep you motivated is love hay will only keep you going for so long and in the process it will leave you feeling super drained so I just want to encourage you if you are in a season I like wanting to get healthier don't do it because you hate yourself because it's only going to get you so far and you're gonna feel like crap doing it those thoughts are gonna come I'm not gonna say they're gonna disappear completely because they still come for me and I'm sure even as I get closer to my goals they will still continue to come that doesn't mean I don't love myself but what we can get better at is not letting it control us not letting those thoughts really weigh us down emotionally I think I probably fell you know that insecurity and heaviness for maybe like five minutes and then I kind of just let it go and I think that is part of Idol like idolizing something we don't want to be idolizing our bodies because that is something we can definitely get trapped in and if we are allowing you know the way our body looks to control how we emotionally feel all the time and that is a way of idolizing and finding value in our bodies rather than what God says about us so just wanted to include this little clip talking about you know body image and just finding your worth in God and not what you look like throughout your health journey you are so loved by God so always remember that as you're going through this process if God loves you you should love you and that's totally okay to want to change things and you know get better get healthier like that is awesome too so just have to have that good balance I hit my 10,000 steps today early so that's awesome I'm at 11,000 now hit that goal and I will see you probably tomorrow for another workout good morning you can hear the birds chirping it is Wednesday I don't really know what workouts I'm gonna do I think maybe like a couple core videos my legs are a little bit sore in my back and upper body so maybe we'll work out the core today don't really feel like working out more so I'm just like bored honestly all this time people are like it's good to have routine now I'm in such a routine that I'm so bored of life you know that's what I always said it's like I wasn't designed for routine routine bores means and now I'm living a life of routine where I come work out at the same time wake up at the same time eat breakfast at the same time and I'm so bored you know okay that's my rant for this morning         cashy yogurt these are from Trader Joe's they're everything I don't know bread cheese this is dairy-free cheese and then I'll probably put the sausage patty on my sandwich cousins bacon and normal she's them and he's having some minerals I'm filming for my get healthy with me except for this is this healthy it's just like a fun snack it's a mister impass it's vegan nachos there go they're not like the best for you but hope you take a little off what it's no one fish on my nachos Hawkins it's all about oh it's so good the corn salsa from Trader Joe's so yummy okay I figured I probably stripped in my measurements to be any of this but I didn't so I'm just gonna measure now just so I have some kind of idea of where I'm at that way I'm not totally relying on the scale to you know measure my results my waist is 29 what's up hmm well it's so funny because I was editing this video and I saw the nachos and then I started craving nachos and I just had the nachos again and I literally came on here to tell you guys that I'm like watching this video and reflecting back and I'm like okay I'm still eating a lot of processed foods and frozen foods but this is a journey and it will get better week by week so bear with me and that was a big goal of this journey was to ease into it instead of going like full throttle on everything and cutting everything out and eating everything healthy so in this video there's still processed foods and processed breads and cooking frozen things that definitely have a lot of oil in it that is not on that is not healthy so just wanted to say beer with me the journey is gonna get better but it is a slow climb you know so just an encouragement that it doesn't need to happen overnight as the week's go on I eat healthier and I workout more and I'm more committed and my spirits are higher and I feel like I'm just talking with my hand a lot but anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this week to get healthy with me journey I love you guys so much be sure to subscribe and give this video thumbs up and I'll see you in my next video bye hello everyone how laughing what did it say it hello everyone welcome

to JJ's house for sponsoring this video and sending me all of these dresses I am really excited to show you all of them they are all beautiful and I tried to pick an assortment of styles to kind of cater towards every bride if you are on a budget JJ's house is a great place to look for dresses I believe all of these will be under $250 but I'll have all the prices included as I try them on and the links to all these dresses will be in the description below so how are you feeling about this I'm actually really nervous really yeah like super excited but really nervous because last time I saw you in a dress on the computer I might have got a little emotional so try to hold back the tears this bad but no I mean don't know how to feel I'm excited I'm excited in can't wait to see you in real life interests yeah wedding dresses we're hoping this isn't going to take away from the real moment I'm sure I don't think it will no way and I am not using any of these dresses for my wedding so I'm not giving away anything in particular and I'm also thinking about giving away these dresses so if you are a bride in need of a dress during this time be sure to follow me on Instagram and look out on there for a future giveaway I would love to give to some of these to you because I probably won't I mean I don't need for wedding dresses so no definitely be following me if you are interested in winning worries ok let's get into the video I'm gonna ask you it Kyle to leave the room while I get dressed there are I think one there's one dress I'm gonna need your help buttoning up the back but I'll get your initial reaction and then you can help   okay love you mm-hmm okay here is the first dress it's this beautiful flowy a-line has a little slit in the sleeve and then if you can't tell has this a little invisible lining the plunge is pretty deep and it also has a train this dress is $135 I got it in a size six and I got it in the color white so this one is super bright if you kind of want and it definitely has more cooler undertones if you want a little bit more of the traditional wedding dress I would get in the color ivory I'm ready yeah call me walk in a little bit before you like a princess I love it so beautiful thank you that's really nice it's like an enchanted princess in the chanson forest do you feel like this is like it's a little over dealing just a little bit but what would you rate this let's talk to the camera oh yeah hey guys totally forgot about you okay um what would I read it yeah on a scale one to ten it's really beautiful it's a little reviewing yeah but I really like it I would give it a I'll give it a seven give it a seven okay it's a little big on you yeah I was telling them the shoulders are a little bit right big that's just something that I'm trying to picture it like really fit perfectly yeah it's just really like what's the words not only used word basic a simple that's the word it's very simple and that's that's why it's cool I like that it's really nice okay here is the next address it's definitely a much different style it is super lazy everywhere and more bohemian bohemian with these sleeves again I think my shoulders are just not very broad and if you can see it has this sparkly belt I am NOT a huge fan of sparkles so that's probably something I would get removed but it is a nice detail if you do like them it's a nice touch there you can see it better now this dress is a trumpet style I got it in the color white and it retails for 226 dollars if you want more of a lacy romantic bohemian dress this one would it be perfect I got this one in a size 8 just because it is a little bit more fitted around my hips and I tend to be a little bit bigger on the bottom so I did get a size 8 however on their site you can get these dresses custom made to your measurements which is an amazing option because they are made to order so there is this one it's completely different so I'm interested to see how Kyle likes it   oh wow that's more you do you like this I like this one better yeah Wow girl let's get a spin let's bring it back okay let's do the proposal oh yeah this is definitely yeah yeah like the other one was really like nice in a simple way but this is not simple you're not simple wow this is like first sure you okay what would you rate this one the audience no and we're only going up to ten right yeah yeah this is for sure I think it's a little sweaty but I love you in your sweat all together oh hi guys I'm too tall I know I'm too short okay what would you rate this one I would give it a this might be aggressive and I might be jumping like I don't know what the other ones are but I'm gonna say nine a night I'm gonna give it a nine okay yeah I feel like this is the one you're gonna like the most I would really like this yeah this is really nice I'll say nine okay okay here is the next dress it is definitely a simple and elegant one this one does not fit me the best in in my chest area it has a really pretty details it has these sheer sleeves and these butt ends I'm sure with some tailoring you could get this to fit really nicely on your sleeves that is this little ruched faux belt it actually is not adjustable it pre-tied and then the back is really beautiful except for I cannot get these buttons so I'm gonna actually have to ask Kyle to do that so he's just gonna kind of see the front of it this dress is two hundred and fifty four dollars and some change I got it in white and I also got this one in a size this one I got this one in a size eight and it does fit good true to size around my waist and my hips it does fit me pretty well I think I would just need to get all of this tailored and then the sleeves tailored as well but overall it is a really beautiful and elegant dress I will get some more clips after Kyle sees it and can help me with all these buttons it is different it's got the simple vibe to it mm-hmm when we're concealing yeah that's nice yeah was a little tight no I happen to buy all of these buttons okay for the picture I'm looking baby we spin beautiful you're beautiful so I think any just second song is absolutely stunning six a six this one ties with the first one no first one's a 700 that's true okay this one I like Alyssa honestly like the simple look looks really good on you thank you no so it's it's just my personality doesn't fit your personality like the other one still has some like flair to it you know I'm saying like some Flair yeah and yeah it's nice but it's not you okay yeah so I would say six is no beautiful dress okay we got it buttoned this is this is the final dress this is I think my favorite and I also think it's the most flattering on me it is simple but then it has some really beautiful lace detail now this one is on the more affordable side it is $180 I got it in a size six and I got this one in the color ivory I'm so it's a little bit more warmer toned not so bright white this is what the back looks like and this the material is just a beautiful chiffon a-line super easy to move in if you are looking for a simple dress with a little bit of flair I would definitely recommend this one it is absolutely beautiful super lightweight super comfortable as well dang it come in so they can see your face this might take the cake I didn't expect that I really like the last it's a mixture that's simple a little bit more pop more flare like this design oh I already use the nine didn't I you did I mean you can break it I could I could   this is beautiful yeah I was expecting to go a the way you were talking about it uh-huh but I really liked the last one to go I'm gonna give it a nine oh this is gorgeous there's a tie mm-hmm this one is just they they're a little bit different this is that simple pop and that's more just like that yeah all over you are gorgeous   okay I hope you guys enjoyed this video we're gonna get Kyle's final thoughts cuz he changed his numbers around I ended up having to put the lace dress back on so he got to see them back-to-back and I mean the last one wins for sure the last one wins so I think the lace one I'm gonna drop down to 1/8 keep that last one out of nine then we got a solid six seven eight nine but oh yeah that last one was by far the one that like in a way really it like took my breath away I was like oh my but they're all so gorgeous and you're so beautiful that was fun watching you try on dresses I can't wait to see the best one the tenant on the wedding day the wedding well I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me see some that really weird I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment in the comments please comment below your favorite dress please comment down below which dress was your favorite I think my dress I can't talk I can't do it I think my favorite dress was number 4 as well yeah I like the lace one too but I don't think I can I'm just like not a full on looks too much for the bohemian bride but it was

and it's all cheap stuff that's a waste of money that's all gonna break after you order hi guys it's Monday I'm tired we went on a camping trip last week so we went hiking but we haven't really worked out since when Tuesday last week we really know what to tell you guys because I'm tired but I'm gonna do - send me YouTube workouts I do an upper body what are you gonna get some cardio and then we're gonna do some push-ups sit-ups all right well that's all folks just a little bit of an overall body experience so you may be very tired however how are you feeling great yeah good all right thanks see on the other side how'd you know you just did a lap with me no you were jogging you did a lap with me all right let me hear how tired you are from walking huh make sure you breathe you don't sit down after a walk we do have a phone rule No you can plan that on your way up oh okay you are just about this bush at all right let's get it what are you doing this why no yeah doing that right now we're here to work out baby   let's get it is it me or my arms moving oh wow look at me I can fly what's this this they go up and down up and down back and forth back and forth it's a farted I don't know what you did oh yeah this is where it's at what am i doing I don't know what they're doing in the video look at me I could've missed touch the ground good morning I am going on a run do I necessarily feel like going on a run not necessarily but I am meeting up with my friend for coffee this morning so I wanted to get something in that was quick so I'm getting ready for that I wanted to show you guys the hair ties I used when I exercise because I don't know about you guys my hair is super thick and it's constantly falling down I have to adjust it especially when I'm running so I have been wanting to try these hair ties ever since I saw Kristen John's post about these a few weeks ago so when gimme Beauty reached out to me and wanted to work with me I was so excited so thank you to give me beauty for sending me all these hair ties and sponsoring this portion of the video I absolute we love their product so these are the hair ties I am using right now they also sent me some of these really cute chunky ones help help honor these there's no cute they have some thin ones they have a ton of different colors they do have some more colorful ones as well but what I really love about these hair ties is they actually keep your hair in place so what's amazing about these hair ties is they are seamless so they do not snap like all of the other hair dyes there's nothing worse than going to put your hair up and your rubber band snapping its honestly tragic so these ones will not snap on you they also can withstand up to 70 pounds of pressure so most elastics can actually only withstand eight pounds so that is a significant increase and they are so stretchy I can wrap this baby around three times but look three times around look there's still a ton more stretch to it and that's another thing they're not gonna stretch out you can wash them and they will go back to their original shape and size which is amazing so these are firm hold and I love these for running I went running last week and I literally had to adjust my hair probably five times or like constantly be pulling on it and then when I switched to these rubber bands I literally did not think or touch my hair the entire time they're so good so I have been loving these yeah we're gonna do a little test cuz I wanna show you guys what the ponytail looks like now versus after I run for a little bit just so you guys can see if you guys use the coupon code Cayenne 40 you'll get 40% off your entire order which is seriously like the best coupon code I've ever gotten for you guys so I hope you guys will use it is an amazing deal also if you spend $30 or more they're going to give you there have been gnats Oliver is that murder okay anyway if you guys spend $30 or more you'll also get free shipping on their website so definitely check these out and let's go for my run and see how this baby hold up whoo all right ponytail check okay I got would be on tick-tock ponytail check haha oh I'm sorry if that was making you cringe what you have this baby oh she's holding up strong all right I should keep running good morning I have no idea what day it is what time it is what part of the video this is my friend Courtney actually invited me to do a fifty-mile challenge and it's through the Nike Run Club app so I think you can download it and start your own challenge with your friends but basically you want to run hike or walk 50 miles by a certain date so I signed up for that and at first I was like really discouraged because I just felt like I wasn't gonna be able to do it but I decided you know I'm just gonna push myself this aligns with my healthy goals and really all it takes is two miles a day and I can easily walk or run two miles a day or like some days I can do a little bit more and then take a day off the other day I ran I believe three miles and this is how I do it I literally go in the neighborhood around here and I'll walk and then I'll run and then I'll walk and they'll read and I purposely just do like walk and run because I really don't enjoy running all the way through I just don't enjoy it and I think my whole life I thought if I wanted to go for a run I had to run the whole time and that's just not the case if my body enjoys walking and then running and then what like I enjoyed it so much and I for prayer time and to listen to a podcast and it was so amazing I think that it's just a huge part of fitness is really figuring out what your body wants because I know when I just try to run the whole time to me it just feels like a punishment because I'm not enjoying it but when I switch off between walking and running I actually really love it okay so there was this ad on Instagram and I got sucked in and then after I watched this like 20 minute video about the products I went to Google and I searched reviews because I don't want to ever buy from a landing page and not like check other sources so then I went and checked the reviews for this product and they weren't the best they were like four-star and then I saw these other products from a whole nother company that all had five star reviews and it was essentially the same thing I had just watched 20 minutes of ads for so I ended up buying these it's from a company called aura if any of you have used this let me know this is not sponsored but I got this powder it is a probiotic and prebiotic all tied into one this is the raspberry apple and raspberry flavor so I'm gonna try this this morning they say it should be like the first thing you have then I also got this digestive the powder supplement and this one is a pineapple flavor and then I think it was like 50 dollars got free shipping so I just got a few sample packets so I could try some of their other products which I really love that they have these small ones so I got the trustor got in the lavender lemonade flavor just so if I want to get another one I can see if I want to switch to that I got their pre-workout powder which is from like beets everyone says how clean the their ingredients are so and then the last thing I got was vegan protein and this one is vanilla I don't have any vanilla protein one of my biggest struggles with health is digestion bloating gas so that's kind of why I got these things I started with the probiotic and probiotic and added a few strawberries and cucumbers the taste is actually super mild I have tried a couple other like gut health supplements and they are so sugary I personally don't like flavored drinks very well so I kind of have to like chug them down but this like the flavor is so mild because there's no sugar added which is really good   I'm really excited I just got a package from free people with activewear I just ordered these dirt in their sale look how tiny a slit these are the medium/large oh my gosh I think they're gonna fit they just look so tiny got the matching top for this one school looks like definitely fits it probably could have got the medium/large top this is extra small small and the medium/large bottoms they are very stretchy so these black ones are definitely thinner they are not spot proof so they are a bit see-through in the back if you bend over so keep that in mind this is called the free-throw crop and it is super comfortable looks like I got this in the medium I also have one in a small so either size works I also got it in black these are so comfy this is also a medium this one is called the watch out tank it's longer for sure it also has like this   they need that accent and back so I mean all of these are super comfy if you're looking for work out tops highly recommend again these leggings are see-through I'm not sure if that gray ones are see-through but that's just something to keep it in mind so I wouldn't like go to the gym in these unless you're buzzed covered I don't know if you guys can see that little light because I cracked my phone on my morning walk I mean that could add some Flair oh my goodness anyway this morning I didn't really want to go for a run so instead I took the puppy where are you I took Noah on a walk it was just under two miles and now I am juicing some celery juice I bought all this celery and I have been putting off juicing just cuz I don't want to make a ton of noise in the morning but no one's here right now so juicing those I was actually just watching a skiing video last night and she was just talking about how having celery juice every day has been such a benefit to her overall skin and health so oh my god I should probably juice all that celery I have in the fridge so I'm making some celery juice can I drink that then I'll probably make some carrot juice it's gonna drink that and then I'll probably have some eggs mmm also I weighed myself this morning and I lost a few pounds that's pretty cool duck this salad has arugula kale tomato avocado cucumber and then I just cooked the mushrooms I don't like raw mushrooms very much but I cooked them in key and put a little bit of nutritional yeast on them and then I have some raw Citro I don't know goat milk cheese goat cheese yeah added some cilantro dressing from primal kitchen I believe and dessert I have waiting for me some fresh peanut butter with apple slices in there just watching Kristen's new video last night I was it was like 8:30 I think or 9:00 Kyle was at a Bible study and I just wanted to like scroll on tik-tok usually when I go into cuc I feel super groggy afterwards cuz it's like an hour of consuming media and just sitting around but I decided that I would go for a walk while I suppose tick tock and I ended up getting walking over two miles just on my phone so there's a little tip if you you know have the urge just watch youtube videos or sit on your phone scroll through tick-tock do it while you're walking cuz it went by so fast it was a lot of fun now it's the next morning and I'm doing a video by Melissa would help I just got a 1 month membership I'm gonna see how I like them doing a 29 minutes arms ads and I just have hello everyone welcome back to the channel we wanted to upload this quick video kind of giving a life update on what's going on if you guys can tell I am in a new room and that is because we have moved I got you yeah super exciting stuff also to clarify because a lot of people thought we lived together before yeah no we did not live together before we lived three walks away from each other so Kyle was able to come over all the time but now you'll notice I say we moved because we have just moved in together wait there's more this is my room and Kyle actually lives next door right and basically what happened was my family friend it's like my mom's best friend she's like a second mom she lives about 35 minutes away from where I live before and her and her husband have been praying about it and they really felt like God put it on their heart their home because they have three empty bedrooms right now and they actually I would originally was just gonna move here so they actually ended up offering Kyle a room here as well which was such a blessing yeah cuz I mean we were praying on it for I mean ever since we got engaged and we knew that you know we had to save all this money and we had all these moving pieces and we didn't know exactly how we were gonna figure it out but we were just trusting God with it and one of the things that we were praying one was like God would you just provide you know we thought that it was gonna be more at least I did there's been more like financial blessings where like more income coming in but one thing that we I don't think we really considered was our bills being cut you know and that's something that God you know really blessed us here with was the opportunity to cut our bills by like sixty percent yeah you know like 60 70 percent so it was just so cool because this opportunity it gives us the chance to live with a godly couple who really love and fear the Lord I mean it's like we get preached to every day it's awesome yeah and you know we get to get an example of what that looks like to have a a godly marriage we had that extra accountability we're like you know honestly we had less accountability yeah just to talk about a little bit my previous living situation it was with like acquaintances and neither of them weren't really like following the Lord or anything like that so it was definitely like a worldly environment there was they didn't have the same convictions as us so it wasn't really promoting a Christian lifestyle or like you know anything that sense so being in this environment where that literally the first thing they asked before they even offered Kyle to move in was like this is going to make you struggle in temptation with your purity we don't want you guys to be here because we don't want to like add to that temptation to the bathroom at the same time something practice already but I'm just having two people here who are really helpful yeah and I'd really love to that they didn't even tell us the price right away it was like we're not gonna tell you the price we want you to pray and make sure that this is from the Lord before we even tell you how much because we don't want the financial savings to sway your judgment and your discernment from the Lord so that was really cool too and they had peace with it we had peace with it we seek counsel you know through parents and you know other friends of believers and it's just you know I'll just add it up and made sense if we had so much peace with it and yeah so we have this amazing opportunity to grow in a new way in a new environment save a lot of money and have the you know opportunity to just experience a way of life that is like slowly getting us closer to marriage like it's funny I was just saying this the other day is we started like states apart right and then we ended up becoming like streets apart yeah right and now we're just doors apart yep so it's cool because in just a couple months we're actually going to truly live together alone and it's just such a cool like journey and process that we see the guy that we just see God doing in our lives and it's such a blessing yeah so with all that being said we would not like if if we were here alone we would not recommend this to anyone and we know everyone is different in their temptation yeah we are so blessed and I really believe it's because of all of your prayers that we did not struggle with temptation so strong so we were totally comfortable being rooms apart we don't sleep in the same bed at all but yeah we are so blessing that we know that's not the case for everybody a lot of people if they lived under the same roof they would be tempted so we are very blessed in that and obviously we wouldn't put ourselves in a situation that caused us yes so have discernment with any decision prayer pray about it seek counsel from your friends your family and other believers that's what we would recommend if you are in a similar situation as us and may have this opportunity come up but yeah it really just feels like were living with like our parents pretty much are yeah but it is such a blessing and we wanted to share this with you guys just to fill you in on what's going on we just want to be honest with you all you know obviously we don't want to hide anything we want to make sure that you guys are up-to-date with our lives in our journey I think what you said was huge is that everybody is different you know and you just got to be careful not to do what other people do but do what God is really leading you to and and really trust in that because to be honest we know probably gonna get a little backlash you know and we know that some people are going to think that this isn't a smart decision and in some situations in cases you're absolutely right but um you know it's also something that we know as well that God speaks to everybody differently and God has a plan for everybody and it's not necessarily the same there are some strict lines and guidelines there are there's sin right and then there's also a gray area in terms of like what will lead to temptation or is it going to lead you into sin and that's where you got to be careful right and how about discernment wisdom but locally God speaks to all of us through that and gives us discernment in that if we truly just surrender to him so that's what we've done and that's what we're excited to share with you guys is how he's been moving what is it like four months yep so under this roof for the next three and a half to four months a month before the wedding we will go apartment hunting and one of us will move in to that place a few weeks before the wedding and get it all set up and ready for after we get married and only after we are married will we truly like live alone and be in the same bed and lives in marriage then there's the married life so yeah that is the update wedding planning is going well I know a lot of you have been asking about it as of now we're just trusting that it's gonna keep praying for us guys please we are blessed in Arizona so many things are opening up again that gives us a lot of you know face because I know other areas things they're not opening out they're extending the orders so we're very blessed to be in a place in one of the first places that things are opening up because that kind of puts us ahead by the time our wedding comes in October okay well if you guys have any questions call mental I would say concerns but I know if anyone wants to leave a concern you guys are already typing oh we love you guys so much thank you for all your prayers seriously we appreciate it so much and honestly they are so felt yeah and if there's anything we can be praying for you please leave it in a comment as well yeah feel free if you feel comfortable with it drop in the comments and you know not even just us we'll pray for you but I love going through the comments and seeing how you guys all interact with each other and support one another so you know I'm sure you would have a handful of people praying for you so feel free to drop in the comments and yeah can't wait to do that okay guys love you right when if I'm looking at her in a way of lustful intentions and desires then that's an issue in its selling we've never experienced sex yeah if you think about it if sex was designed for marriage and that's the way God designed it we've never experienced truly what sex is we only experience sin one person it doesn't bother them whatsoever for the next it could really cause a lot of lusts to come and say their mind touching straddling laying in bed kissing we're standing up kissing sleeping in the same bed cuddling and all those things excuse myself yeah hi I'm tan and I'm Kyle okay no you're just my fiance and you don't say anything weird did it no hi everyone welcome back to the channel my name is cayenne and I'm Kyle okay welcome to the cheek give you guys the heads up there oh yeah there has been a lack of consistency and uploads we just moved so I'm really struggling to adjust to getting a schedule back so I think I'm honest I think I'm up on up though so hopefully videos will be more consistent but I know as we get close to the wedding like who knows yeah and on a more important note my toe is massive they don't need to see your toe my toe is massive he got bit by like an ant or something it is so bad I really want to show them we are finally sitting down to do the long requested video about boundaries so video it's gonna be all about boundaries how we set the our journey and answering all your questions on it let's get it with that being said well we're definitely prey into it and then we'll do a little disclaimer after that it's an important disclaimer for you to watch okay thought agai we just thank you so much for this day for the lives that your bless us with for the opportunity the privilege to just truly know who you are as our Heavenly Father and who we are as your children God is just so amazing to be able to be your hands and feet and represent you with our words our actions and our deeds and we ask that you would help us to do that because we can't do without you so Holy Spirit we just ask for open hearts and open minds we ask that you would help us to surrender to you fully and allow you to speak through us we pray that you would just speak what it is that you want to be said and whatever isn't from you Lord we just pray would be discarded and thrown away and so God we just thank you for this opportunity to spend this time together glorifying you and we give you all the glory the honor praise in Jesus name Amen   okay your hands are sweaty Oh claim your boundaries I mean I just thought it was just something that is like okay this is it that's that moving on and you just do it like clear-cut 100 percent universal like no questions or variations to it at all just like yeah so easy but actually not so much so that's what part of the reason why it took us so long to do this video because I really wanted to go through the whole experience before sharing about it and I feel like now we're at a point where we are solid in what we've set for us and we know it works for us and God has taught us a lot along the way because it has not been perfect and we've learned a lot and it's a journey that God will most likely take you through you and your partner I for some people it might be clear-cut from the beginning and then there's no trials tribulations but for us there was and well sure have discernment your answer on what your boundaries are going to be is not gonna come from us that's gonna come from God and the Holy Spirit and your own convictions because we are not gonna be perfect definitely no standard we are not the standard Jesus as the standard I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that I'm the standard and this is what everybody should do cuz we're all different we all have different things that trigger us differently we all have different things that tempt us differently and we have to be aware of ourselves when you're making these boundaries you can't look at somebody else B I go well they did that so I'm gonna do that does not work that way so really taking the time to in a way evaluate yourself and also your partner you know to notice okay well this might not affect me but this might affect her or vice versa yeah I'm really taking the time to pray to God and ask him to make it clear to you like where is that line and how can we stay as far away from that line as possible yeah and that was a huge convicting thing throughout the process it's not how close can we get to the line it's how far we can stay away from the line so if you're asking how far you can go they say you're right yeah Megan asks what was your process of honoring your own individual boundaries and then creating them as a couple so first let's get to the process mmm what were your personal boundaries getting into relationship yeah so I was saying my personal boundaries they were very to be honest unclear because I've been out of a relationship for so long but I knew certain things whereas like I knew the feeling of lust and my personal boundary was to stay away from that feeling of lust right and that kind of encompasses a lot but overall it was if you know me looking at a woman and when I got a relationship with her it was Cayenne right when if I'm looking at her in a way of lustful intentions in desires then that's an issue in itself and praise the Lord that he really helped me to not feel lust from things that normally would have gotten me lustful when pre Jesus and in my past relationships because when you know I did get into this relationship with you I didn't really have any of those like lustful full thoughts or desires or like getting sucked into the trap that makes you wanna have sex or something yeah yeah in a way of like like really like desiring like the sexual intimacy desiring you know even just like nudity and you know anything that's really gonna like arouse me or get me going it's like that is well that's true you know those thoughts and God talks about that is not necessarily just what you do but the thoughts you have in your head and having those thoughts is just as bad as doing those those actions so for me that was really big as not to have those thoughts you know and I'd be like I said and be very beginning the relationship like they didn't try to come in so when they started to come back in I was like oh no no no no no not today saying no matter day my personal boundary that I came to during my singleness was I mean nothing past kissing like at all so second base third base for the home base we're just out of the question get out of here but I was comfortable with kissing I did I do have friends who are not kissing until marriage too so I mean I considered that for sure um not very long did I get stares that before it is an option and I think it's awesome yeah it especially if that's what you need to do to prevent you from going farther and a lot of people who do have that boundary it's the intention of it is because they know kissing will lead them to something else it's not necessarily the active kissing but what it could like open up the door to right so if that's the boundary you need to have more power to you do it one thing that I did do though was I didn't want to kiss anybody unless I had confirmation that they were my husband are going to be my husband and so that was a lot easier for me because I didn't date and that made it a lot easier for me not to kiss anybody but I always held that in my heart like I am NOT gonna kiss anybody unless I know that that person is gonna be my husband because if I don't know that to me it kind of felt like a way of dishonouring my husband in the future like oh yeah I was just kissing these guys but I knew that I wasn't gonna marry them and now that you've come along like great you're here I love that so much so that was something I shared with Kyle when we were on the cruise ship so we didn't kiss at all until we got that confirmation and he was on board with that yeah so and I think that's a great way if you are you know younger or you're just not at that point considering marriage right now it's just a great way to keep yourself from becoming too like physically attached to someone and creating a bond with someone who's not going to be your husband I mean we were very blessed that we got a confirmation within a week so we were gonna get married cuz it would have definitely been more challenging if we were dating for like months hmm and just not kissing at all but and then what was our process creating boundaries as a couple I mean it was just that it was a process yeah so we kind of knew that we both did weren't gonna go past kissing that was just like a universal thing yeah but then there's like you know kissing like peck kissing and then there's like making out and then there's all these little things in between you don't really think about like touching straddling laying in bed kissing for standing up kissing sleeping in the same bed cuddling and all those things so that's why it was a process because as the relationship went on we came up against those things and we had to pry through them I think the biggest one that was the process was like making out yeah laying down specifically yeah it was that was kind of like one of those things that I said is you know kind of like preventing the lustful thoughts from coming in and making out laying down made that more difficult and it was one of those things where it's just you're too comfortable you know you're just too comfortable and then you know you just it becomes more passionate mm-hmm and then at that point it can just open up doorways and leads towards you know you falling into other temptations yeah during those moments there were times where we had to stop ourselves and say like okay that was too far too far and not even like too far like we crossed the line but like too far like we're way too close to crossing your line yeah we still did it anyway like we had those moments and we would still do it anyway it was like a refining process the board was putting us through though because he was giving us the conviction to stop but then after that moment passed it was like okay you know he slowly but surely made that conviction last longer and longer and so the point where I was like we were getting convicted before even doing it yeah and then it was like okay we got it I think this is a new boundary we got to so you gotta talk about yeah we got to talk about this do we just not make it at all or is there like specific locations that we shouldn't do it and I guess the first conclusion we came to was like doing it in bed was like no no yeah no no way too much yeah so then we came to that and then also there were times where I would like straddle and that was not good no no no no and I hope have some grace grace we share this in order to be helpful yeah transparent and it's like anyway so those were two things that we were like okay those are two things we should not do and then we kind of set that boundary we had a little boundary talk we set it and then time went on and we started doing it again then we would be laying down and we'd start kissing and then we would be like yeah yeah that's true and then that conviction grew yeah and so it's a refining process so we had talked about the boundary and we had a lot of questions of like okay once what happens if you cross the boundary like how do you go back when what's the process for a question yeah so this is what we did we realized we keep we kept crossing a boundary we had sat and we just didn't feel like we had integrity in it and that we were following through with it but we still knew it needed to be there right so we're at the park one day and I think I brought it up was a good talk and we kind of just reframed like why we're doing this I think that was that was our issue that was a huge turning point all right issue with why we kept falling backwards was we felt like we were doing it for other people and if you're really just doing it for other people it's not like really it's not something that like it's not it's not it's not for you so it doesn't it's like not that big of a deal I don't know it was just weird like that mints holiday we had behind it it wasn't strong yeah so I knew eventually we'd be making this video and so when we were making my bound like our boundaries I was like okay well I'm gonna have to share this eventually feel like it kind of came about like oh well would I be comfortable sharing that with people and that's why it was it felt like it was for other people and we didn't really have a strong why for ourselves of like why are we doing this and I think that's a huge thing like I talked about it might get healthy with me videos it's really just the intention behind it like if you set a role because you hate yourself or you care what other people think just out of a bad intention it's gonna be really hard to keep that intention but if you set your intention because you personally want something and it's because you love yourself or you want to honor yourself in honor of God it becomes a lot easier and enjoyable yeah there's a lot more motivation behind your actions and we use the same business all the time and I know people still do but when the Y is big enough to how does not matter you know so as long as you're wise big enough you'll be able to get through what it is you're trying to accomplish but if your Y is not big enough then the hell does matter that you get focused on the hell and then you end up failing right it's just how it works so yeah that's what we got focused on the how and then so we had a talk and we just re reset our intentions we are doing this to honor God to look forward to in our marriage and like create it to be more of an exciting thing that we get to do yeah also during that talk we decided we were not gonna have sleepovers because at that point Kyle was with sleep over and it didn't tempt us so we were like okay well I just for him to like sleep over that's the thing it didn't tempt us but we had to find a better reason to not do it because when we were just thinking about oh well is this tempting or is it not tempting no it's not okay well then you know there's not much conviction to stay with the boundaries so he would keep sleeping over and it was at that talk where we're like okay that is something we want to experience when we're married yeah it's like being able to sleep in the same bed and it worked like it became so much more joyous and every time you had to leave at night it was like oh well like I just can't wait until we get married and we get to do this like it became more of an exciting - oh I just can't wait so I don't have to walk home ride my bike home late at night to go sleep in my bed but it's funny because you would think like now only the indoors apart it would be harder but it's actually so much easier because of that as well where it's like we're hanging out watching TV and then it's like whatever we're doing and boring you know now it's over it's time to go to bed okay boom I'm just gonna go to my room you know and that's been really cool yeah she's not right to sing that beforehand when it was hard yeah like you were super tired and you had to like write my comments like that someone said this is a silly question but when in a relationship is it okay to cuddle never I think that's also like oh very nice personal decision because I know I've talked to men who said like cuddling does tempt them yep especially like spooning positions yes can be tempting so again it's a personal conviction I know some people who will only hang out when they have a roommate around or something like that so there's more accountability or they'll only hang out on a couch and they won't like spoon or cuddle we do cuddle and that has not been something we've been convicted about at least not yet who knows like I said it's process so maybe it will but yeah I once again it's you have to know yourself you know you have to know yourself and your partner and you have to communicate about it and be honest about it and really take it to the Lord so you can give you that wisdom and discernment that you're looking for because it really is something that for one person it doesn't bother them whatsoever for the next it could really cause a lot of lust to come into their mind and that's you don't want that when it comes to something as you know as innocent as cuddling because of what it can take where it can take your mind and what it can lead you to it's just important to keep that in mind yeah how do you guys enforce the boundaries set and how did you hold each other accountable mmm I think we kind of touched on that and one of the biggest things I would say is really making the commitment to each other and to God not just about us but also bringing him into the mix you feel a lot more accountable when you have like talked to God about and said God we're gonna do this yeah I got the part we literally were like all right like right now we make a commitment to each other and we make a commitment to you God like we we just were just like he was right there with us cuz he was and we just made a commitment to him as well and you know like she said she want to kiss anybody before she knew was her husband cuz she want to honor her husband right and this is the same thing you know when you set these boundaries you want to honor one another and when you bring God into it you want to honor him and it just man I would say that's the key right there mm-hmm yeah a lot of people are asking about emotional boundaries and spiritual boundaries so we can't really speak a whole ton on this because within a week we knew we were gonna get married and I think once you enter engagement it kind of changes because it's like I know this is gonna be my partner although I have heard of experience of people getting engaged in and ending things but I mean we really knew that we were gonna get married and so kind of all of those like spiritual and emotional boundaries got lifted I feel like in the engagement process because you do have to unveil your heart and really let the other person in so they know like who you are and who they're marrying and what you struggle with and what triggers you and your past experiences and how they've impacted you because all that information is very useful in being in a relationship if the other person cares yeah because if they care they can act on that and Kyle now knows certain things that have happened in my past that trigger me or you know make me feel a certain way and he now can respond moment yeah better understanding yeah and I think going off of that where it kind of gets lifted because the whole to become one process you know it's like we really are being sanctified and being brought together to become one if you're having an emotional spiritual boundaries in place and I may be totally wrong on this I'm not really sure and we looked at this we're reading I'm like what are emotional spiritual boundaries like within our relationship right like obviously we have them with other people for sure but in our relationship coming together and getting married yeah we're just like I don't think we have any yeah we sure we've shared like a lot we pray together we share a lot of spiritual time together so we haven't created and I think the reason why we feel so comfortable and all of that is because we're engaged and we are in the process of getting ready to become one and we know we're getting married like that's the thing like I know she's my partner for life it's not like okay we're engaged and we'll see how it goes and maybe I could get out next week or next month you know before we get married like no yeah it's like you know from God we know so I could see in a relationship if you're not 100% certain why you would have those boundaries up you know but if you are and you're on the same page you know for me it's hard to see why you would have them up mmhmm yep and I have friends who have been in relationships where they didn't know they were gonna marry the person and they didn't have those emotional boundaries and it ended in a lot of hurt so you know there's definitely purpose and emotional and spiritual boundaries I'm actually gonna ask one of my friends if she would want to share on it because she definitely probably has a better understanding cuz that's not something we have run into in our relationship but I know she has so hopefully she will come to a video with me so stay tuned for a whole video on emotional boundaries if you have any thoughts on this drop it in the comments I would love to see it we would love to get you know a different perspective on it as well mm-hmm you have physical boundaries while making out his stand his hands stay on your back a cedra we were just talking about this like I mean we do we do we have touching boundaries like he doesn't touch me and also we were gonna say like we don't really make out anymore it's so weird it's actually really funny yeah and it's like nine away that like we don't like desire each other but yeah like we were making out and then it got passionate and then we said the boundaries and then it just kind of like that might sound bad you know because it's like well if you ever tried to make out standing up or sitting down enjoyable that's really nice so I think that's a huge part which it's like that's why doing in bed you're just comfortably it's a cultural like now it's like the only time we would do it is if we were like standing or slike sitting and it's like I don't know back starts to hurt your neck starts to hurt not enjoy a book so I think that is obviously one of the big reasons why we just really don't make out partly at all no no no we don't do that no no no questions somebody asks how to start a conversation on boundaries because I know fear can get in the way of having that you just got to be clear on your intentions and what you really want it's important boundaries this conversation open communication is super important like she came up to me actually and she was like hey like I think we really need to talk about boundaries perfect right great way to do it that confidence and that is key yep I think once I mean the cool thing is if you set your boundaries before you're in a relationship that makes it really easy because before you even start dating them you can tell them what they are like your personal boundaries and if they're an agreement you know and they know and it's kind of all discussed before you guys get too attached cuz trying to set boundaries like a later down the line it can be harder mm-hmm because you might try to set them and then the other person's like I didn't sign up for this like this is not right and they might not have that conviction yeah that could be troublesome so I think setting them for yourself at least having a general idea obviously like we said it's a process and that might change but having like a good general idea of what you want your boundaries to be and just sharing that with the person before you even get in a relationship and if that's not an option for you like if you're already in a relationship and you want to bring those up I think just like pray about it ask God for the confidence to do it and just know that like boundaries is a fun thing I mean it's literally about honoring God so that sounds like fun right yeah absolutely I think once you get to a point where you realize like this is a good thing this is honoring God I'm excited to execute these until I'm married then it gives you more confidence this should talk about yeah and remember God's with you throughout it all you know he's gone before you so put your faith and trust in him and he'll help you through it he'll such a pass Cheri what is the furthest both of you have gone well morning for born-again virgins yeah so we've gone all the way but just on up with each other I'm a virgin virgin thank you Jesus grace in your mercy uh forgive us father we did not know how do you live in the same house and not have sex it's actually quite simple yeah you stick to the first boundaries and you just carry them over into the lit new living situation and your honor God and one another yeah and have the end goal in mind I mean we don't we want to save that for marriage yeah we can't wait to have sex that's gonna be amazing but that's for marriage yeah you know and he's so special and great yeah there's there's a reason why God created it the way he did my marriage right marriage is a covenant and you know it's when to become one and the sexual intimacy having sex is an act of two becoming one oh right it's an act of worship and it's something that you know we want to honor our creator or God with the way he created things you know by following the way he created it so mm-hmm one thing I wanted to say that really helped me as a born-again and also like some of my friends who were struggling with that who have had sex before because they're like oh like I really want to have sex or like sex is so great and they talk a lot about their sex life like they know but what I have to remind them is like we've never experienced sex yeah if you think about it if sex was designed for marriage and that's the way God designed it we've never experienced truly what sex is you only experience sin so if you're like obsessed with your sexual history or just like talking about you know how it used to be just remind yourself okay that's what it was when I was sinning so I've never really even experienced sex in like thoughts holiness and in marriage and the way he designed it so really I've never had sex I've never had sex the way is created and if you really hold on to that a lot of your sexual like a lot of people hold on and like oh I've already had it it's like okay you might have already had sex but it was sin you've never like there is a reason to save this for marriage because you haven't it's still something new that you get to experience with you once you're in marriage so I think I think that really helps just to consider that's powerful that's powerful right there rewind this watch that again come on girl how do you stick to your boundaries and steamy moments lol please keep the novice you care for the steamy moments yeah don't create this demon Cruz because that's what we were doing when we're getting caught up in the steamy moments and we would have we would have God would give us enough willpower to stop ourselves in those moments what we realize is like we shouldn't even be creating that kind of environment that we need like that we could risk going further or crossing it so yeah as much as it sucks trust me you know it'll get better once you agree to it but you have to not have those steamy moments so it we don't have passionate make outs you know save the steamy movies sameness teeny moments you handle mess ups and mistakes I think repentance is huge and like if you think about repentance it is the act of turning a hundred eighty degrees in the other direction and so if you mess up it really depends on your personality because some people take advantage of it cuz I want to say like give yourself grace because when you do mess up the devil will use condemnation to keep you stuck so if you are genuinely hurting over your sin then I trust that you're not going to take advantage of God's grace repent you've already received you know you know you're already forgiven but the act of repentance is huge and really humbling yourself and like I said repent is 180 and opposite direction so in those situations it's like okay what do we need to do to literally turn around from this in and it's like okay I need to set new boundaries okay we need to fast from touching for a week or kissing for a week or for a month or whatever it needs to be like we've definitely talked about doing like kissing fasts if we need to the only person who is designed to be perfect was Jesus and we are not going to be perfect and we are gonna mess up but you can't let the devil like condemn you for that because a lot of times that will keep you in the shame and guilt and it will cause you to keep sinning but when you really receive God's grace and understand what Jesus did for us on the Krauss it's a lot it's a lot more powerful place to be like okay Jesus died for me to overcome these sins I'm gonna take advantage of his blood because it did not like go to waste and I'm going to receive his forgiveness and his power and his Holy Spirit and I'm gonna keep pressing on and we're gonna get better come on preach so good yeah I mean no condemnation for those who are in Christ right so if you're really in him you shouldn't be feeling condemned but at the same time don't take advantage of his grace that's I think something called it hyper grace one time and it's like oh well I have all the grace from Jesus so I could just continue doing this and it's fine it's like no if that's what you're doing you're not feeling any conviction on that you probably don't know Jesus sorry because he will make that clear to you and he will burn in your heart in a way of feeling the conviction that is needed to make that change and to repent so yeah that was so good I think I love that Thanks and then just one more note on that is if you are not feeling conviction over these things just get to know Jesus more like we don't want to say like you need to have these convictions because over time in my journey becoming a Christian they came slowly like it was like oh like I'll think about saving myself for marriage and then like six months later I had sex and then after I had sex all of a sudden I would be like crying and I was like whoa where did this come from apparently I really do want to save myself for marriage it's just a process so these convictions and might not be there right now but as you get to know Jesus he's gonna give you that heart for them um so we're not here to like condemn you if you don't have these convictions I know for me it was a process it happened over time slowly but surely I was like oh I don't want to do this I don't want to do that and wasn't anything I did is really just Jesus absolutely that's it that's all it it's just get to know Jesus more and that's it you know he gives you the wisdom to discernment the convictions the understanding the direction he clear and if you feel like you're lacking in that just get to know more it's a beautiful part about our relationship we can grow in in mmm so good we hope you guys enjoyed it if you guys have any other questions or you want like another video about this let us know it'll turn we try to cover as much as we can yeah all right be sure to give this video thumbs up subscribe to the channel please share this video with a friend that really helps support us so if you think this video is helpful at all feel free to share love you guys bye I'm Kyle Oh God hello everyone before I get in to the video I just wanted to quickly say that I am praying for all of you guys I know this time is extremely heavy for all of us especially the people in the black community and I just want to say that I love you and I am praying for everybody in all of these circumstances and I will touch on this more in depth in a future video it honestly feels so silly to be posting anything else right now like this get healthy with me video but it is what I have for today so I hope you can enjoy it and just know that I will speak more on this hopefully in Thursday's video I just wanted to come on here before it all starts and just let you know that I love you so much I know there is so much more important things going on in this world besides my health but well I love you and just please comment different ways I can pray for you right now specifically I love you all so much good morning welcome to this week's get healthy with me I'm gonna be honest the last two weeks week and a half have been pretty rough here's what happens I got my period I am healthy and it was just a few days it would have been fine but then because I have such like past emotion tied to eating those things in a short period of time it just starts to carry on and it triggers like those old habits and then I just start eating healthy unhealthy even more and it feels way more emotional like when I'm on my period I kind of justify it because I'm definitely an emotional eater so having those extra emotions on my period I'm like I just want to eat but then coming out of my period when I should get back into eating healthy I just get lost it's just really hard for me in particular to get back on track after that just because of my past experiences so that's kind of what happened I stopped eating as healthy I also stopped working out for a solid period of time honestly I worked out maybe three times in the past two weeks and I'm just kind of getting back into things now and even that was really hard but as you guys know I just moved and another thing I've realized about myself is moving just triggers is so much stuff as well I'm not one to really get into routine easily so when I was in a really good routine at my old place with waking up working out having breakfast and all of that stuff like it was like very synchronized every day and then to move and be in a new place I would just expect to be able to jump back into that routine but that's not the case so it's been a solid like week here and I don't have a routine and so therefore it makes it a lot more difficult for me to work out because if it's not built into my schedule I just push it off and honestly I felt really defeated and especially with my engagement photos last weekend I felt like a lot of pressure on myself I was like wanting to look a certain way for the photos and I've just been putting more pressure on myself for this fitness journey this past couple weeks and I mean it's so funny because when I put more pressure on it it reflects in me not doing anything so anyway I went out of the bike ride the other night and I was just praying um and really what I realized is my main focus had shifted it became like my reason for working out was because to look a certain way at the photoshoot or to look a certain way at my wedding and yeah that doesn't work clearly I will tell you again and again but you know its ups and downs I have to relearn this lesson over and over again and that's okay but my main reason for working out was not because I loved myself or to feel good it was for a specific event and I just crack under pressure so not good not good for me so I've been trying to realign myself with God and my messaging of I work out because I love myself because I love my body and my body's like a temple and a miracle to even be working I'm just gonna go to the backyard set up like a little towel and do a couple of videos just trying to get it done straight away something new I've also been doing is swimming because there's a pool in the backyard so yesterday I swam some lapse I'm not a swimmer I literally Kyle was teaching me how to die because I had no idea how to dive so after I did like a 30 minute workout in the park I went in the backyard and swam I think like 30 laps at there like very short laps and then did like five dives or something I'm practicing my diving and swimming but honestly I'm a little sore so that's okay   okay it is the next day it is Friday I didn't jump into my normal like ideally I would like to workout first thing in the morning however last night I had coffee I like four or five and so my sleep schedule just wasn't the best didn't end up going to bed till midnight so that I didn't wake up until like 8:30 9:00 so anyway what I'm trying to say is I didn't workout this morning but and I really haven't felt like working out at all but what I do feel like doing is swimming sitting by the pool and reading the Bible so I just decided you know that will be my workout I'll get in the pool I'll swim some laps I'll practice my diving I don't know if I mentioned this but I'm trying to learn how to dive it is 5:30 and I just want to make sure I get some kind of activity in today because I've been sitting all day long I have not left the house so I think just being out in the water will be a nice break from everything else and really a good time for me to get in the word with no distractions so let's go down to the pool oh I got you wet   good morning it is Monday morning yesterday was Sunday I didn't work out Sunday I also had some Pizza Hut but that's like struggle but oh I need to not feel guilty about eating the pizza that is the key because when I start feeling guilty is just not good so when you eat something that is not healthy or in alignment with your goals you really have to own that decision at least I do or else I start feeling healthy and then it like it's in my head so right now I'm just going to let myself know I really wanted a pizza I thought about it for over two hours before I ordered it I enjoyed the pizza I feel okay today I had my digestive enzymes it was my decision to eat the pizza I can have pizza and now I'm going to continue my life feeling my body with healthy is alright this is the process I think getting back into a fitness journey when you take time off you feel like you need to catch up and like overdo it instead of just jump back into like a balanced life anything that I do that's not an alignment with like my health goals I feel guilty about so that's why it's really important for me to like take captive of those thoughts and just pray and just ask God to help me through that because if I start feeling really guilty it's not good that's what leads to like overeating binge eating stuff like that so I try to get Kyle out to work out but he's tired which we literally went to bed I like 10:30 so I know how that kid sleeps so much so it's about 7:45 now I think I'm gonna go for a run when I was going for runs pretty frequently I definitely noticed just improvement in my body overall and the way I felt so I'm just gonna start Shay with a run even though I think it's a hundred degrees outside and then maybe I'll like swim some laps afterwards to cool off but we'll see how I do out there cuz it is hot even at nighttime here it's like 100 degrees right now it's getting so hot anyway that was a lot of rambling but yeah I don't work out started running but my knees really hurt I feel so stiff so I'm gonna walk and run for like really short periods of time to see my heart rate up and try to get a solid two miles in I love my body I love my temple jesus loves me I can do anything Christ my body is a miracle and it is perfect because you can do it wake up wake up wake up sleepy I just kissed the camera finally got Kyle to get out of bed what I only got Kyle to get out of bed mm swim some laps final part now finally like it's like 1 a.m. it's 9 a.m. like it's like super late I thought you went to bed 10 I know so I just waking up I was wild he's wild that you Wow crazy it doesn't stop when he goes to bed he just goes on his phone and no and then I put on a sermon and then no I just like wasn't sleepy having some cottage cheese putting this everything basic seasoning salt and pepper actually measure it out the portion sizes want to keep better track of my servings I really hope you enjoyed this and this lifted your spirits a little bit during this time I just wanted to encourage you before I end the video and just say that you were so loved by God and I just encourage you to take all of your emotions right now to the Lord and just pray read over his word God is the only thing right now that's going to bring the peace we need in this world and if we can just all rise up as prayer warriors I know we will see a shift and everything that's happening and until next time I love you and I'm thinking about you guys constantly hello everyone welcome back to the channel if you have not been here before my name is cayenne I know a lot of you guys are new so hello it's so good to have you and I have been so off schedule but in the wake of everything going on I really wanted to be patient and wait on the Lord for instruction on how he specifically wanted me to speak on everything that's happening in the world right now God has blessed me with this platform and I always want him to come first in leading me and if you guys have followed me on Instagram you guys are probably more familiar with what has been going on what I have said about this so far and also the challenge that I launched quickly just wanted to share my experience over the past two weeks I've tried to have a very Christ centered mindset when it comes to everything that's going on really trying to keep my emotions at bay and not get too emotionally distraught because I know when I'm emotionally distraught the enemy can work his way in so I've been really trying to keep my eyes on God that meant not posting anything right away and just really waiting on the Lord and seeing what he wanted me to do first and foremost I want to say that I am completely behind black lives matter and the end of racism and with that being said I know a lot of people are like well the black lives matter movement supports and teaches things are not biblical and if that's what you're focused on then you're missing the whole picture black lives matter is a statement it does not have to be tied to the organization and I have not specifically shared anything from that organization so I just wanted to say that and I get I just get so many messages like trying to send me things that I'm like guys why are you focus your missing the point like everyone just trying to like debunk things and like fight against statistics and unlike all this energy that you're putting in to sending me this stuff like put it into prayer for what's happening I last week was praying a lot and I was just God like what do you want me to do how do you want me to respond and but you know even before I speak like how what do I need to reflect on what do how do I need to humble myself what do I need to learn from this how can I become better from this how can I become more aware of Rachel racial prejudice and bias in my own pass or you know that I currently am experiencing and I really wanted to focus inward before just reacting to what was going on I really wanted to respond to what was going on during that time God really put on my heart to start the seven-day align with Christ challenge and that's what I'm in the middle of doing right now it is a Facebook group there's almost a thousand of you guys in it right now and we are going through seven days of like intensive work the first day was about Jesus the second day was about anger and today is actually about equality and this is how God asked me to channel all of my emotions and passion for this subject was to pour it all into the seven day challenge so if you guys want to be a part of it it's not too late to join I'll leave the link in the description everything has a topic tagged so you can navigate through if you're doing the challenge later on personally what I really wanted to do was help people get back into alignment with Christ with everything that's going on I know the devil is using it to divide us the verse effusions for 26 through 27 says in your anger do not sin do not let the Sun go down while you while you are still angry and do not give the devil a foothold and I've just been thinking about that verse a lot a lot of the things we're watching on social media and a lot of the things that I hear from people who are going to the protest and all this stuff is that they are very angry and the bible does say a lot about anger and it doesn't necessarily say don't be angry or God expects us to never be angry I think there is such thing as righteous anger however we are not supposed to sin while we are angry and we are also not supposed to let the Sun go down on our anger because that is literally giving the devil a foothold on our life and I'm not saying it's wrong to be angry I'm saying it's wrong to send while we're angry and that has just been something that God is really showing me right now and honestly I don't even know what this video is gonna be about I just asked God to kind of lead me through it and see where he wanted to take me so that's where we're starting is anger and Ephesians 4:26 through 27 and I really feel this is what the devil is doing there's a lot of spiritual warfare right now and there is a lot of righteous anger that this is something that should upset us and if we think about when Jesus has gotten angry in the Bible it is when mark 3:5 it was the Sabbath and the Pharisees were watching Jesus and there was this man who are my believe needed to be healed and the Pharisees were watching to see if Jesus would work on the Sabbath and like break the rules and Jesus like looked at them angrily and that is an example of Jesus being angry in the Bible and I think sometimes we forget that Jesus has emotions and he was a hundred one hundred percent human because it's honestly crazy to report minds around that but this was an example of Jesus being angry but what he did after that anger was just so astonishing to me he healed the man anyways and I think that is what God really just wants me to just Zone in on and just press into you today is that we are still called to heal when we are upset and when we are angry and we are so called not to sin and not to act out of anger Jesus was angry at these Pharisees right after they saw that they left and to kill him and yeah he still decided to heal this man even though he knew that them saying this do this was going to lead them to plot to murder him he still acted in obedience and acted from his true self which was love and He healed in the midst of his anger and that is what really God has put on my heart to do with this challenge is how can you channel these emotions and just everything that you're upset about and all the injustice in the world and all the racism in the world and all the hate in the world right now how can you channel all that into something that will heal people and I think as Christians this is what we need to be asking ourselves right now it's not like who should i attack right now with all this anger where should I put it and like who should I take it out on it is God how can I use the visa motions for your will to do good how can I use this anger to tell people the news of Jesus Christ and why we so desperately need him and that is something else that I have really focused on during the seven day challenge is that we need to remember the cross and everything we do we need to keep Jesus at the forefront and that was day one of our challenge as we watched the crucifixion of Jesus and I'll have that video linked below and I highly encourage you to watch it because once you watch that video it just humbles you in an incredible way to literally witness what Jesus went through and he was silent we had every reason to stand up for himself and to fight back and to defend himself and he remained silent during his crucifixion the only thing he answered to was when they asked if he was the son of God and he said I am throughout everything that's going on in the world we need to see the cross when we see people getting hurt and injustice and racism and hate we have to remember that this is a battle of spirit and not flesh and blood Ephesians 6:12 like nailed that verse into your head when you see a person a child of God sinning you have to know that that is the devil or a spirit from the devil working through them it is not who God designed that person to be and everything you're seeing right now is such spiritual warfare and as soon as we start taking it personally and attaching this person's actions to who they are in Christ then we just give the enemy so much power because that's what he wants he wants us to fight us as people and he especially wants to divide us as a church anyway to circle back what I want everyone to focus on during this time is the blood of Jesus and if you're consuming all this stuff on social media and it does not make you think about Jesus even the bad stuff especially the bad stuff you should be able to look at the bad stuff and say wow like you should be on your knees like wow thank you God for what you did for sending your son for people like this and like me who are wicked and sinful and lustful and just fleshly like thank you for being our Savior thank you that I don't need to depend on these imperfect humans for my peace like thank you for sending your son and when you see the good in the world you should still be rejoice a it's just like always rejoicing at the cross and if that means you need to watch this video of Jesus getting crucified every day to remind yourself that what he did covers everything it is more important than everything what he did is more important than everything and that is where your peace will always be source from if Jesus isn't your right now with everything going on we cannot work together to do God's will and what he really wants us as Christians to be advocating for right now we won't know because we're so caught up in our emotions that we were not submitted to God and literally just humbling ourselves and saying god I'm a hot mess right now I am angry I am furious I am I'm sad I'm broken like everyone around me is broken God what are we supposed to do like you really have to realize that God knows and he has a plan and a purpose and he has something for all of us to be doing right now but you need to push everything else aside and I really encourage you during this time to take a fast from social media because I know consuming a lot of stuff on there can really take our eyes off the cross and really get us distracted and really just fuel emotions that the devil wants us to keep feeling I'm Philippines 127 whatever happens conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ then whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence I will know that you stand firm in the one spirit striving together as one for the faith of the gospel without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you this is a sign to them that they will be destroyed but that you will be saved and that by God for it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him and I absolutely love that verse and how it ties into everything that's going on right now it says whatever happens literally whatever happens conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ and Lord knows that none of us are worthy of the gospel of Christ yet he's still here Paul is still here as he has to at least try to conduct ourselves in a manner worthy of Jesus if Jesus saw what you were sending people right now if Jesus saw how you were expressing your hurt right now if Jesus was in the room with you because he is would you be proud of what you're doing I like just tell people about Jesus people are hurting and they need to hear about the gospel I also like that it says stand firm in the one spirit striving together as one for the faith of the gospel without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you and the devil is at work y'all there is some major spiritual warfare that's going on right now and there will be a lot of people who oppose you and that's okay like the Bible says over and over again that people are not going to like us and that is okay and that's just a whole nother tangent I could go on that God is just taking me on this journey of it stop defending yourself you know you don't always have to be right or prove yourself right or like just stop defending yourself let people have their opinions all you can do is like stand firm and your truth and like sometimes that just has to be between you and God and this says stand firm in the one spirit capital S the Holy Spirit right now God wants us to all stand firm in the one spirit which is the our Holy Spirit and sin separates us from God that's why Jesus had to come because our sin we couldn't have a relationship with God and because of Jesus now we do have the opportunity and what a blessing that we are able to literally communicate with God God is calling us to use that gift and stand firm in that and strive together for the faith of the gospel I had originally planned for this video just to be like reflecting on you know where racial bias comes from and just coming being like yes like there is things as a white person that's I was conditioned to believe and if you grew up in a society or a household where you had no racial bias like more power to you but I think a lot of us need to sit here and just reflect and really ask God to expose any of that that's in us and I mean I forgot what verse it is but I'll have it here it's confess your sins to your brothers and sisters and pray for each other so you can be healed for the prayer of a righteous person is powerful or something like that that's my paraphrased version I think as Christians it's really important for us to confess our sins and to reflect on our sins I think that's something we really get wrong as Christians as so many times people think that Christians are supposed to be perfect and we're not we strive to be like Christ but the reason Christ is here is because we are imperfect and I think so many people think Christians think that are perfect or act like they're perfect but I think a lot of us just need to get better at confessing our sins and confessing how imperfect we are because when we all pretend to be perfect we're gonna fail people and they shouldn't be looking to us we should be so humble like listen I suck I seriously suck but because of Jesus I am forgiven that is what it means to be a Christian it doesn't mean you're perfect and just to say that it's like we should be really all reflecting on our sins and it's okay to admit that you have had racial bias and Prejudice in your past it's okay to admit that because if you don't confess it like how how do how is it supposed to leave you how is there supposed to be a change if you won't even acknowledge it and so this past week I've just been asking God like show me show me the places are ugly or just different circumstances where I believe something that wasn't true or I was trained to think something and it's just such a powerful conversation to have with yourself and I really encourage you like to just take some time and reflect because that's the way this is gonna go away is through self-reflection and Jesus Jesus first being first and foremost Jesus is the only one you can penetrate our hearts and change them on a supernatural level so Jesus is the answer and I think a lot of us need to take some time and just reflect on how we bought into this or play a part into this and really just work on making ourselves better and she's asking God to meet us there and prune us of any prejudice that still lives within us and I know when I came to Christ a lot of that bias that was inside of me went away that was something I needed to just think on and pray about it be like God where did this come from because this is stuff we need to be aware of like when we have children not to pass this on anyway this was probably just one big bramble this was literally not what I was planning to do at all but that's okay I hope it spoke to you I really encourage you to join the Facebook group and watch all the videos in there because I speak on all these topics a lot more I just want you guys to know that Jesus loves you so much and throughout all of this we can still have our peace because of what Jesus did on the cross and having peace doesn't mean we're complacent it means taking up that cross and walking and pursuing Christ every day and if Jesus was here right now like these are children of God these are children of God these are children that God died for so what are you doing what are you fighting against like Jesus came here and died for all people black white and everything in between his death was for everybody and you need to start treating people like the queens and kings the descendants of Christ the princes and the princesses of Christ because they are all sons and daughters of king of the King the Almighty God Oh anyway I love you guys I am just so blessed to be a part of this community with you and just to hear everything that God is doing in all your lives especially in the Facebook group I love you guys so much and it has been such a blessing for me and honestly this is the first thing I've done in a long time that I'm really truly proud of myself for and that's all glory to God because he is the reason why this is happening and he is the reason why it is so good because he's working through everybody it's so amazing to see just kind of let you know one more time keep your eyes on Jesus throw yourself into his presence this week and you will see everything change and shift and you will be able to approach these issues and in justices with just such a thriving spirit it's so important because right now the devil is trying to drain our spirits and disconnect us so I love you guys I hope this video touched you in some way what's up I'm doing a little something for the wedding and that is getting together my bridesmaid proposal boxes or bags I guess I'm a little bit overdue but I decided to work with a company for this I have to get some photos of everything before I can actually send them out to my friends so that's what I'm doing right now I'm taking some photos the company I am using is wedding favorites I actually first saw them on Instagram one of my friends used them to do her proposal boxes and I thought they are really cute so I went on their website and got to pick out some things for my friends and my proposal bags so I'll quickly show you kind of the different things I picked out but I'm doing these babe shirts sleeping mass these sports water bottles a little cosmetic bag and then my favorite thing are these like burlap tote bags they're actually really high-quality and definitely something I would use to go to the beach or grocery shopping or something like that put together this one already in there but I feel like it's pretty it looks pretty empty so I was thinking about like getting some flowers and putting together like little bouquets for the people I'm asking in person at least just so there's something cute sticking out okay I am doing my first round of floral arranging practice I went to Trader Joe's today for some groceries and they had a lot of great flowers there so I decided to pick them up and take them home to practice doing some floral arrangements I don't know if I've probably mentioned it already but I decided to do the florals for my wedding just order flowers and bulk and kind of do like a build your own bouquet party with all my bridesmaids and then I'm just gonna really do like simple greenery on the table and maybe pop some roses in there here are all the flowers I got and this a big vase I got a dozen roses gosh I should move in ooh yes folia that's chamomile this is kind of like a fun one I don't think I would do that in my actual bouquet but I thought it would be fun to play with these are spray roses and then I got some eucalyptus I believe those are silver dollar but I'm not sure they had some other options - I decided to go with those because they're a little bit more flowy and bigger so let's play around I ordered from Amazon it was super cheap but it comes with some likes nippers and laurels I'm gonna see how this is and if I like it I'll probably buy a few more of these kits for my bridesmaids so let me do this Hardy comes with four wire floral tape these things I don't know green oral tape I've watched a few videos on YouTube hmm but I'm certainly not an expert but I know there is a method to opening up this so that's try to do that's what it looks like flipping down just the outside I think I might flip some more I honestly feel like this is gonna be pretty therapeutic so if you are in need of a therapeutic activity why don't you put some arrangements together honestly my life feels better already oh so that's the one I opened up okay I think I have settled on this this is the final look okay I ended up taping it with some floral tape Monica does not speak so good I think I'll probably buy like a better kit or tools because these are super cheap these snippers don't work well for like thicker ones so I'll probably definitely buy some nicer snippers and better tape but for now this is what we look like I think this is pretty similar to the bouquet I would make for my wedding I probably want to do some more like blush roses instead of all white next up on my wedding to-do list is save the day slash invites we're just doing it all in one go Kyla's mom offered to help with them so she really likes using Vistaprint so that's what I'm gonna do they just have templates in there and I uploaded our one of our engagement photos and I'm just gonna throw it in the template easy so that is what we're doing for save the dates and then I'm just gonna have people RSVP online because I don't really want to spend more money sending out invites and you guys have gotten married recently can you tell me what wedding signs you would recommend having I honestly haven't thought of any like should we have a welcome sign is that really necessary do we need to have like a gift sign all this tedious stuff I don't like doing that part I'm like who cares just figure it out why don't we need a sign to point everywhere everywhere I guess it's just a nice touch but anyway let me show you the aftermath of floral arrangements this is what I worked in with update I decided I have a bunch of extra flower so I decided to do a little mini bouquet this one was super quick to put in the bags I'm gonna see one of the girls tomorrow so since I have these fresh flowers thought it'd be cute to stick it in the bag I'll show you I needed to pick up some tampons so I thought that was a great excuse to go to Goodwill as well anyway I'm still drafting things for the wedding I would like to get more candles because candles are so overpriced so if I can find any more candles here that'd be awesome our candle holders it is so hot it is like 112 degrees is what my car says I am so hot and I can't even wear like sleeves because it is so hot so I'm trying to find more tank tops and goodwill usually has a bunch so hopefully I can find some more because your girl is a sweaty sweaty mess   I'm probably glistening because I am so sweaty top I don't know if I told you that earlier okay I just got back from Goodwill and I did it a pretty good run the deal was yellow tags for $1 I couldn't find any yellow tags I only found I found a lot of pink tags but I got quite a few things for the wedding so I'll show you that and then I got a couple things for my future apartment our future apartment let me move in together okay first thing let's do the wedding stuff first so goodwill has a ton of these candle holders or vases whatever you want to use it as so I highly recommend getting these at Goodwill usually they're 99 cents if you can find the day that there are half off you can get them for $0.50 and usually these things are like mmm I would say four to six dollars a piece so I found two for 99 cents and they're like super clean so got these and these are just things I'll put candles in on the tables I also look through like the crystal section and try to find kind of more unique glassware to put candles in so I actually bought a lot of like goblet cups on my last drifting trip to put little tea light candles in I just thought it was like a unique way to dress up the table because I think these are kind of boring but pear next to this pretty fun so I figure I'll just put a little tea light candle on this one and all the tables will be mixed matching this was 2 dollars and 50 cents and it's really heavy-duty the next thing I found was this it's very what I'm blanking Beauty and the Beast like very Beauty and the Beast vibes it's just a candleholder but I thought it was really pretty and Arvind you actually doesn't allow exposed candles but I'm hoping they'll let me but like something like this on the sweetheart table so we'll just need one of these to put in front of me and Kyle with some candles in it and then just not like them and just kind of more use it as a statement piece for decoration this was it didn't have a price tag but she went back and decided to price it or six dollars and fifty cents and it is very heavy-duty then I found guys this is why I need to go to Goodwill because they have so many candles I found this 12-pack for a dollar fifty I'm sure this thing is usually like six dollars so that's why I go to Goodwill because they have candles and a lot of times they're brand new never used and then if you guys saw I went and looked on the wall the back wall that has all these bags highly recommend going through those bags so that's typically where a lot of the candles aren't it is just a big bag of like candles this was 250 as far as home decor I found this beautiful vase look at that is so unique and this was only 250 and I figured I would just have this I don't really have a place to put it here but figured I would get it because I'll definitely be able to utilize it once maybe I'll move in together and have our own place and then the last thing I found what a score I feel like this is like the stuff is so in right now Kyle's gonna be like what the heck is that but it definitely matches like the tropical vibe I hate that word vibe right now I just don't like it the tropical feel of my room my room is kind of like boho tropical very neutral and I figure this would be like a good wall piece for our living room yeah and this sucker didn't have a price tag and she priced it to 50 and it's big so that's a steal it's a little bit like falling apart as you can see but it's a good time um so that's all I got from Goodwill for this wedding thrift haul um I guess I'll show you what happened target puns guys I'm on the hunt for good organic tampons all the ones I've tried don't open up and absorb at all so I'm hoping this is a new brand that I'm trying so I've tried like three four different organic brands so I'm just gonna keep trying them until I find some that work and then I got some deodorant this is my favorite natural deodorant it works very well you do have to reapply maybe like twice a day I like to try new scents this one is great fruit and bergamot I almost went back to the lavender one because I like the lavender and then I smell this and when I got cinnamon rolls because Kyle love cinnamon rolls and it's our anniversary on Saturday so I mean the surprising the cinnamon rolls in the morning this hall is boring but I got toothpaste to pack challah and then this is kind of more fun I just got this like sleeping tank and short set because I don't know if I mentioned this but I am so hot they like to keep their house here at 82 degrees and I'm used to sleeping at 70 degrees so I just need more shorts to sleep in because I can't really sleep in my underwear because Kyle walks in you know so I've been looking for more shorts to slip in and just like walk around the house in because oh I'm sweaty you know all right well that's it for this haul today's thrift haul cost me $19 today's through today's the thrift haul was only nineteen dollars in this sucker was the most expensive thing I got it was 650 so if I didn't get this I would have gotten everything else for like $13 so that is awesome if you are planning a wedding I highly recommend thrifting I feel like it just there's so much unique stuff and then there's also just like the basic stuff that you need to put candles in so highly recommend thrifting it's really fun I have a Bible study like probably right now also I'll see you guys later I get on my zoom Bible study was started during quarantine and my

been like where are we going and that's what I would have dropped it on her to my surprise I keeps you as you can see like those moments of joy but like like we've said you have the rest of your life defragment read to me by the end of our relationship you will be very good at surprising yeah and I mean like you admitted before we started this video even throughout it I was still able to pull tricks on your ass about you you still are tricking me throughout it and deceive you in a loving way so I feel like there's some success in ms J hat cool surprises 6-month anniversary celebration all right well I'll see you all I'll show you guys where we're camping and everything we went to Walmart and got a bunch of groceries that we needed sorry there's probably super loud Kyle just we came to another Walmart because the last one didn't have any firewood so he just ran in to get it in his eyes a lot of things are going wrong and so he's not in the best mood he's pretty frustrated right now but that's okay because it'll wear off by the time we get there you know those days where you have something plan and you have an expectation and then it just seems like everything goes wrong and it's really hard to get out of those bunks I have those days Kyle has those days but I think it's also really important to include that kind of stuff like I'm so grateful that he's planning this trip and he clearly is very attached to the outcome of it and he really wants it to be perfect so I know that's just him expressing that he cares about it so I'm doing my best to stay positive during it all and not let my baby get taken down one of us has to be like one of them has to be strong when I'm in a bad mood Kyle needs to be the one who isn't a good mood if we're both in a bad mood it really sinks sinks down hard things are gonna get better hopefully next time the cameras out Kyle will be smiling let's pray for that guess what Walmart don't have any firewood now we're a Home Depot I feel so bad I just wish I could take his frustration away you know I'm gonna throw on some worship music when he gets back I think he'll feel better once we're on the road right now we're just hopping around everywhere and while we're here I know so many people are gonna ask if we sleep in the same tent especially because we have that boundaries video we do sleep in the same tent this is like our one time where I guess we don't follow our spending the night together rule honestly it gets so cold at night I don't even think I could sleep alone without freezing we don't really can't kiss at all wouldn't we spend the night together but if this situation would be tempting to us we would definitely not do it we would figure something else out sleep on opposite ends of the tent or whatever we needed to do to not be tempted I would not spend the night in the same light tell me our hotel bed together that that gets a little that's pretty dangerous and territory it's just like when like we are staying in our boundaries video it's just it's too comfortable so I think sleeping in a tent it's not very comfortable which gives us a nice safe guard but if you guys were traveling and staying at an Airbnb together or a hotel together I think that would be too comfortable for us   look at these cows this guy this guy's huge we saw some animals look at this morning right   check out this view she's dirty it took us an hour about to get down that road but Wow was it worth it oh this Wow this is an epic photo   kyle is doing   look doesn't it look like you heard a story I've heard it said I've come to believe that love bet sometimes you win and sometimes you use sometimes it calls you right come to my table come to my bed go easy he's in my head bringing me fire bringing me they're taking me high taking me down       what's going on in here why do you have to be in here to do it it is so windy out here   oh that's a job you jump them up here over there I'll be right here Irish -   hey beautiful   and spot setup Organic should be the last so we're trying to leave we decided to say another night but cops car died and luckily there is a car here however they are camping on a cliff out there so we're kind of trying to decide if we should go down there and wake them up but 8:30 in the morning but yeah you need a jump and these girls are like camping on the cliff and so right after I filmed that video we saw a girl walking so we called and yelled at her nicely we called her own hollered slightly yeah and she came up and it jumped the car and it's so funny because last night Shay got stuck and Kyle went to go help them so then this morning they came to help us but they actually left they left and they were gonna go say somewhere else but that it was close and so phrasal cardia that I had to come back to this ball hello everyone welcome to today's video I am so excited for today's video I went back through all of my footage from the cruise ship where I met Kyle and I literally vlog the day before the day I met him and also one day I think after our first interaction and I literally talk about him in one of the clips and it's so cool to look back on so I thought this would be a fun video I also I'm going to share some voice memos at the end like me reacting to them because I texted two of my friends that I met my husband so I'll put in screenshots of that later and then I also voice memo to one of my friends with a bunch of details I have no idea what I said I still haven't listened to it so I'm gonna react to that live on camera at the end of this video and then throughout this video I might narrate a few parts so you guys can put the pieces together and then if you guys are curious to know me and Kyle's full love story then you can go watch our videos we have two parts and then we also have an engagement video and those will be linked in the description so if you're new here by the way my name is cayenne and I met my husband a little bit over six months ago I'm not even married I met my fiance six months ago on a cruise ship and it was such an amazing blessing from God and yeah we're gonna get married in a few months so excited but yeah I hope you enjoy this video it's just wild   what's up welcome to today's video I'm actually staying at a hostel tonight my Cruz leaves tomorrow right now I'm walking to get some time     good morning I went for a run this morning and it was so happy I couldn't stop smiling I just got to Fort Lauderdale last night and I'm leaving on a cruise today because my friend Brittany is getting married right now I just booked a hostel I've never stayed at a hostel before but I'd like to in the future especially like when I travel and if I ever plan to go to Europe I know staying in hostels is huge over there so I thought I would start getting used to it now it definitely feels like I'm at like summer camp I have enjoyed it so I'm headed back to my hostel now I'm going to go change into my swimsuit and the beach is literally two blocks away you can see it from here so and get in the water   finished up at the beach like these glasses kind of look oh Claire not me finish up at the beach I saw an acai bowl place last night so I'm gonna walk over there it's about an eight minute walk get some breakfast and then I actually have to pick up a few things from Target and then the cruise should be boarding around 12:30 so it is 10:00 a.m. now going to get some breakfast running a couple errands and then head it to the boarding found this beautiful building such a pretty color I'm going to try to take a picture in front of it     oh my gosh I will give you guys a tour later I mean there's really not much to see that's about it but the girl who was actually going to be rooming with me couldn't make it due to a family emergency so I literally have this whole thing to myself which is crazy I am pretty much an introvert and pretty independent so I definitely don't mind being alone although it would have been nice to have a little travel buddy but I thrive alone so I think I'll be okay so I was literally in line at the port to get on the ship and I realized I left my camera my nice DSLR camera at the hostel and I had no idea kind of what to do I was like I should definitely get it cuz I called and then he found it but it's like a hostel so it's a little bit sketchy and he said he's gonna put in the office and I was like okay like I can come get it next week and he was like okay but I won't be here and someone else might move it he just seemed like I don't know it was kind of sketchy the way he was talking about didn't give me the most confidence so then I thought of the idea that I could send a lyft driver to bring it to the port so then I had a lift I ordered a lift at the hotel and I was gonna call her and just tell her to go inside and get the camera well I called her five times and message her twice and she didn't answer so then I was like okay I think God is just trying to tell me that the best thing to do is just go and get it yourself so I got an uber drove 25 minutes to the hotel had him drive me right back around I got my camera thank God and it honestly only cost $20 roundtrip and then I gave him a $10 tip so it was $30 for me to go get my camera which costs over I think $700 so definitely worth it and luckily I picked the earliest check-in time for the cruise so it wasn't an issue at all that I had to leave and come back so thank God I have my camera I have everything with me oh this is just like a reminder to double-check everything I am oh I just needed to double-check that I have things but I'm on the ship so I'm gonna get settled in probably my bag actually hasn't arrived to my room yet so I'll probably get settled in a little bit set up like my internet and all that stuff and maybe you go get a snack I found my luggage in the hallway so I'm gonna unpack probably change and then probably go get lunch we are meeting the bride and groom at 5:00 at the pool so I kind of have some free time until then   okay I want to pause the video right here because this is the moment that I met Kyle for the first time so as you can see all the clips before this I was definitely in my single Diaries mode I was independent wasn't looking for a relationship at all and I was going to lunch by myself I went to breakfast the next morning by myself but this was the day that I met Kyle we all had met at the pool or like the specific deck and he was there and if you guys want to hear that whole part of the story you'll have to watch part one of our love story but I just kind of want to give you a reference of time this is what I met Kyle and the video I just showed where I paused it literally that's where he was talking to one of my friends for like two hours but that is where we first met and then I went back to my room and got ready for dinner and then that night is the first night we kind of talked and I think that night is when we stayed up until like 2:00 a.m. at the cafe just like getting to know each other so when I went to Target I picked up two bottles of wine so I'm going to open one now and I don't know why I got two glasses but we're gonna have a blast I'm just watching else's wholesome delight chillin we're going to dinner in about an hour so after I'm gonna make a glass of wine and then maybe start getting ready   this is my help but kind of having second thoughts not sure like I should change the top because I feel like the top is pretty casual for the shirt so then I try to dress it down with sneakers but now I just feel like it's I don't know I think I'm gonna change out the top         okay so the clip you just saw was me going to breakfast and this next morning I went to breakfast alone at this point man Kyle it didn't really have any communication because he didn't have Wi-Fi like we didn't get each other's numbers however we were in the same group so the next morning I had breakfast by myself and then I was walking up our deck and we happened to run into each other again I ended up sitting next to him while he was reading his Bible and I was reading this book and that was kind of the start of day 2 which is all explained in the other story so make sure to go watch that so you can understand it more and then that day we spent together and we were just like running around playing and that is where we're gonna go into next is I believe this is day 2 and we stumble into like this arts and crafts room and this is what happened and then afterwards I ended up actually talking about Kyle in a clip having no idea yet that this was going to be my husband we have three minutes or throughout a competition yeah they started like this vessel of yours will pray over in Jesus name let this boat stay up Jesus led us dead this is URI cross on your cross we stand it is now day three on the ship I don't think I've even talked to you guys if you just saw the last clip I was making an art and craft we like me and my friend stumbled into this craft area of the kids kids part of the ship and we just walked in and they were having a competition to build a boat and we decided to do it and it was so cool there was like this woman who saw our Jesus boat and she showed us her daughter's boat and she put like a cross on her flag and she told us about like a really cool cruise retreat so like if you're married they have a retreat for you to go to and it's shoot the nail already I will insert it somewhere but they have a like a cruise for Christians and they have like Christian entertainment they have speakers and worship nights and it sounded amazing so that's really cool I want to look into it and see if they have it for people who are not married and then shortly after that my friend Kyle started talking to the worker and just like was asking her questions about her life and her dreams and then started talking to her about Jesus shared his testimony with her and I was just like witnesses I just kind of like stood and listened and he like just shared about Jesus and like what it meant to have a relationship with him yeah just straight-up evangelizing to this woman and she was so receptive and open to it and open-minded and I like left and I felt so like shocked because I've never seen someone I think evangelize before like I just had never been that close to that but yeah I just got back to my room and I just started crying because like I desire that boldness it's weird to think that I do that through my videos in a way and I think I have to be careful because they don't want to compare myself and like that's a gift that he has and you know maybe that's not my gift but I also desire like to have that boldness and courage to talk to strangers about Jesus and God and I do in different ways just I've never seen someone do it so boldly so I like came home and yeah I just started crying and I think I'm still processing through the emotions as I talk right now I just figured I should open up the camera and talk because that's how I process things typically it's a lot easier to process when I just talk out loud so I'm still trying to figure out what this all means but it was just a really really amazing thing to witness and I just started crying thinking about like that could be her testimony and how like it could make us so uncomfortable in our flesh so uncomfortable to share that and be that bold but it could save someone's life and in that way like that's why we are called to die to ourselves to save people's lives so I'm just having revelation I'm gonna pray on this and see what God is trying to teach me through that because it's definitely a lot for me to take away from that conversation but for now I have to get ready for dinner I could be ready in like 25 minutes so wow what an experience that was amazing so much to think about but I'm gonna pray on it reflect and then I'll let you guys know what God shows me how adorable is that oh my goodness it obviously makes me uncomfortable to watch but I think it's so cool this is just a random clip of me trying to open a bottle of wine for about 15 minutes but I thought I would insert two text messages that I sent my friends I think this was maybe a day after all this happened so maybe four days into the trip I sent my friends these messages and then after this I'm gonna start reacting to the voice messages look who came over so now Kyle is gonna react with me to these voice message voice messages I have I haven't listened to these since December so I'm never listening I have no idea what I'm about to say okay let's do it       I think I'm gonna tell her well she says arts and crafts I think I'm going to tell her what oh my goodness that's why to give you that lies you're being smart protecting and guarding your heart is got calls us to that's so funny to you that was something I was very adamant about because I noticed especially with my friends and me from personal experience any time I would repeat something and like tells a friend about a guy or something the more I talked about it the more I couldn't see the kids activity   I was already committed to not going to this wedding is the last wedding of the year I've already been to like five of them couldn't afford it I was like I'm not going sorry Jukes I love you but it's not gonna happen and then Jimmy yeah okay so this is the   I'm just watching it's really cool to see a lot of single die isn't there it's just peaceful friendship what     okay that is the end of this video I hope you enjoy seeing a little preview of our love story from a different perspective and you basically got like library and reactions from me that's really cool for me to listen back to because then I can really put myself like exactly how it was feeling during that time so that's really fun I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you liked it give it a thumbs up make sure you're subscribe to the channel and I'll see you soon bye lovie and I do it today in my life it's 8 a.m. I slept in today I usually wake up at 7 and do a workout class at 7:30 today I'm doing a 9 a.m. workout class usually when I wake up I hope where Kyle's room I wake him up look at this I've successfully woken up Kyle now I'm gonna do a quick devotional this is the new morning Mercy's actually Michelle Reed recommended it and it's really good so far so I'm gonna do today and then I need to get dressed and headed to so I have been going to Orangetheory and I think I'm gonna do a whole video just talking about my Orangetheory experience and sharing like my results from it it's been really nice to just have a place that I can schedule out my workout I can leave the house and it just keeps me accountable because if I sign up I can't cancel because they charge a cancellation fee let's finish my workout I'm so sweaty the cool thing about orange theory is you have a little wristband that you wear that keeps track of all of your stats so I will insert all my stats right here you'll see how many calories I burned how many miles I ran not make splat points I got I really like that because then I can compare this workout other workouts before I hop in the shower I'm gonna make a to-do list because I have quite a few things I need to get done but they're all in my head and I get a little frazzled when everything's in my head and I don't have it listed out if there's too many things this is the planner I'm using it's from Urban Outfitters like you have places period to-do lists but you also have like an hourly schedule out it's also not dated I can like hop around and just use it when I really want to because I'm definitely not like a every day planner     like to split it into different sections like just general things I need to do things I need to do for YouTube things I need to do for my client very helpful just to organize all my thoughts so my next thing we need to do is a shower eat and clean so let's do it I have been loving robe life it's honestly pretty life-changing I have never really worn robes before I found this one at Goodwill for I think four dollars how about me similar roses yesterday the so sweet and I think I'm just talking you guys to avoid okay the first thing I have in the mornings these break it down enzymes and the trust your gut powders from the brand hora I have been taking this for about two months and I think it's really helping one is a premium probiotic and then this one's supposed to help with digestion and honestly my bloating it has gone down definitely since taking these I hardly I maybe get a bad blow like once a week but I used to get it like every day so I really think these are working one table oh my gosh I made this another day I forgot to put sugar in it that's weird okay I'm in he's coconut palm sugar I'm not gonna do a full tablespoon because I don't like things too sweet so just about that much cinnamon I loves especially a my coffee lifehack I use brother using Trader Joe's oat milk kind of have an app let's see ah bitter I'm gonna drink out of this truck the top layer can be really gross this is the other milk that I like okay the room that looks so much better and I feel so much better mentally so now that everything is taken care of I am going to do a little bikini try on haul this video is sponsored by Cup XI if you guys haven't seen my last video with them I've worked with them before and will continue working with them in the future they have great affordable bikinis that are on trend and also I really love their cover-ups so I'm super excited to show you what I got this month and they are going to be having a huge fourth of July sale so I'll leave all that information plus my coupon code in the description so and all the links to these specific bikinis you can find them easier this is the first bikini it's super cute one piece I love just like the ruffle detail and I feel like it's pretty comfortable modest and the back is pretty full coverage and I just has a clasp like this this is the NYX bikini it is this green one you can see the pattern up close I've gotten all of these in a size medium this is the next one it's definitely one of my favorites it has this beautiful floral pattern and I love this little boat detail the next thing I got was this beautiful cover-up this one goes to my mid thigh and it's great to throw on if you're like walking to the beach this is gonna be perfect for my honeymoon this is the next time suit it is literally highlighter orange but I think it's really pretty and fun for vacation the back has this cool detail cut out this one is so beautiful it definitely screams like bride to me I love just the scalloped detailing on it here to wear on the honeymoon and you get up close you can see it is that does have a little pattern on it as well and this is the last bikini it is also orange this one's not as bright if I could go back I would get the top definitely any small has this cool detail on the back however is not adjustable so that's what it looks like and then I'll show you the last cover-up so I think this cover-up is really beautiful it is longer so I love that just ties in the back has this beautiful crochet detail and I think it would be perfect to wear on the honeymoon in case you guys were wondering right now we are planning it for a Greece that is it for the Tryon portion of this thank you again to cup chief response during this part of the video I absolutely loved working with them and love how affordable their bikinis are again I will have everything linked in the description if you are interested and let's get on with my day     just make this scramble I love it okay some exciting wedding stuff is that our save the dates already they got sent to Kyle's mom and she is going to be addressing all of them and saving or sending them out now I'm looking at our Zola registry and I'm just adding a custom header right now and just adding a few things to it we don't really have much on there because we prefer people just send us money which sounds kind of bad but we would rather have help funding the wedding and the honeymoon because I think I've said this before but we are paying for old majority of our wedding I would say we're paying for about 90% of our weddings this is the option they give us right now and I just wanted to do a custom one up here so I just took one of our engagement photos with the same dimensions and I'm just gonna save a few of you have asked for like our registry or an address to spend gifts for the wedding and I think that is like so sweet of you however I don't know I just feel weird doing that so I was thinking of anything maybe we'll get like a little p.o box so you guys could send like letters or something like that instead of yeah I just don't want to ask anybody forgives I would feel really weird about that but if you'd like to send a card or something of congratulations feel free or if you guys have your own business and kind of want like a product featured maybe then you can also feel free to send as well I'm just gonna show you a preview of what our registry looks like right now I got it all set up in Zola we have our wedding fund and honeymoon fund as like the most wanted gift and then I just added a few things a blender a nice set a vacuum toaster wines like I don't know all very neutral and then I put a couple of home decor things it's cool because you can do it as like a gift a group gift so people can just contribute and like I do not expect anyone to pay that much but you know if someone wants to throw $50 towards it I have been dying I've been following petal and puff for a while on Instagram and I just love all their stuff and I got an email that they had some stuff on sale so I like went and browse the sale section and I found a few things I like so I'm so excited sure is the ruffle dress I think it's really pretty kind of the pattern it comes with this belt I don't know if it looks better like tight in the middle or on the side I feel like the cut of this is kind of weird I think I have to like oh do you think it's supposed to go here no here is a better look of like the color and the pattern here is what the skirt looks like it's a really beautiful super comfy I really wish I had the top that matches but I just paired it with this one from forever 21 um it's a size small the color obviously needs to be steamed but here is the next dress I love it I think this one is my favorite I just love the pattern I love the tie-up I love the square neck also when you take the tie off you could definitely tuck the straps in and wear this as a skirt because it's a MIDI length it's not too long but yeah I just love it it's super comfy here isn't up close huh but the patterns okay I just got another to do off my checklist I called the bio store and paid for my bail and then the mailman came today is just a big package day I guess so I actually ordered the Kristin made picking berries bag I'm doing a video inspired by her which should be out in the next couple weeks I'm so excited I've literally been planning it forever this box is huge I love this style so cute I love these handles really adorable that's how I feel when I'm on Instagram for 30 minutes to an hour I don't know how long I just was on my phone but I got into an Instagram stories hole I'm gonna go make some toast I should look at my to-do list again because I feel like of it I haven't been that productive I'm really having like it's Saturday you know give myself a break okay not too bad the therapy session and offer up or something I can do really quick so I'm gonna do that right now so I can check more things off so I have been checking offer up periodically to look for wedding stuff one thing I mentioned in my last video is like wedding signs and like what do I actually need so a few people said definitely like a gift sign or card box would be important and a guestbook sign so I found both of those that offer up this is what I'm getting I'm getting this card box and then this knife set cuz I'm just like whatever yeah cuz I was looking online and they're like $40 for frickin cake knife sets anyway so I found these this one I think it's cute and then I'm also getting this plea sign our guest book sign and I'm getting it all for $40 I think I got a little distracted and started organizing all my goodwill stuff basically I have been thrifting a ton of stuff for the wedding so I started putting all the candles in here I think I have enough of these like smaller ones and the tea light ones I also have these I need more of these like big chunky ones and then I have a bunch of these vases to put them in I have about 17 vases right now I also have like these cups that I'm gonna put the small candles in either a tea light candle or one of these guys if they stand up straight that should work I think I'm gonna start taking off these stickers and maybe like watch it a movie or something taking all the stickers off I'm using this lemon oil and it helps so much gymnastic documentary it's about the sexual abuse in the gymnastics world and my friend Justine was actually young and askew gymnast and she told me I should watch it yesterday so I was like you know what that is the perfect thing for watch well I do this and so far it is really good really informative and also really heartbreaking all at the same time but it's on Netflix if you guys want to watch it and I'm just gonna be here   finish all of these took up all the stickers I never want to take off a stick her again I am eating some leftover Chipotle I just started the show I'm gonna see if I want to watch another episode it's a little bit cheesy but at least the acting's get in it if you guys are wondering where Kyle is he is at work and he does instacart right now which he literally goes in grocery shops all day and delivers it to people um he was doing life insurance but God called him out of it so maybe I'll call him back into it but right now doing this allows him to make his own schedule it's also bringing in a good amount of income and it isn't mentally draining for him which when he was doing life insurance it was super mentally draining and spiritually draining and all of that so I'm just really grateful that he worked so hard every day hopefully he'll be done around 7:00 or 8:00 usually the latest he gets home now is 8:00 and then usually we go in chill in his room we actually have a projector which I'll show in a future video and we've been using that and we just chill in his room and watch a TV show and then usually got a bed super exciting but yeah I don't know I might end the vlog here I hope you guys enjoyed it let me know if there's anything else you want to see in the future and I love you guys so much have a ord help me oh great hello everyone I'm Cayenne I really don't want to say welcome back to the channel I just I want to be more creative okay so what do you want to do hello I'm cayenne and I'm tired welcome so bad welcome welcome to okay welcome to our first Bible study whoa like first recorded violence yes I think we have one other on proverbs on my ig TV so you should check that out but today we are gonna be reading first job okay I get a doughnut after this we're reading first John one I'm actually doing a Bible study with this with some girls and we just had it yesterday so I was super inspired to go through it today you guys just said first John - right no no we're in Philippians but first John is fire all John is by so I figured we could do kind of like five videos going into first John hopefully that all pans out well like a video every once in a while of a Bible study I know a lot of you guys have requested that so let's just get into it how do you pray for us everyone watching yes Father we just thank you so much for your love we thank you so much for the relationship that we are blessed to have with you we thank you for your goodness and your faithfulness and just the way that you speak to us the way that you've given us your word your living word to speak to us each and every day if we choose to just dive into it if we choose to give our lives to you and if we choose to welcome you and so God we just welcome you in this body study we welcome you into our lives I prayed that through this you would highlight whatever it really is you want to stick you would just illuminate it you would make it just such a strong conviction in our lives in our hearts so we're not just hearers of the word but actually doers of the word so we apply this into our lives and we just walk in your light so we thank you Jesus we welcome you and Holy Spirit to do what only you can do and we just pray that you speak through us anything that's not from you God just eliminate it just remove it just block our ears from it but everything that is from you Lord just let it really hit us in the heart so we thank you Jesus we pray this in your name drumroll is great you guys are a family the drumroll let me know I want to know okay all right we want to tell you about the context a little bit what we're reading if you guys want something more in-depth definitely go watch the Bible project but basically they believe it's written by John one of the John's yeah possibly the disciple John and it was written to a community of house churches it was written for word damage to control and also to kind of echo Jesus's teachings yeah so it's not a lot of new information but it's really just echoing what Jesus has already taught us yeah you know there's at a time I think like about a decade after a generation after everything basically went south where it seemed like the body was getting separated Jerusalem went down and all the Christians scattered which was a blessing because the gospel went to the ends of the earth but because of that everyone was so separated that you know people were being misled or they were becoming false teachers or people were living in darkness and drifting away so this was to remind the believers Christians of who Jesus is what he did for them and who they are in him which sounds pretty applicable to today doesn't it for all of us okay so I'm gonna start off by reading one through four and then we'll go back through it and kind of break it down first John one I'm reading from ESV version that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we looked upon and have touched with our hands concerning the word of life the life was made manifest and we have seen it and testify to and proclaim to you the eternal life which was the father and was made manifest to us that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you so that you too may have fellowship with us and indeed our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete so when I first read this I was like okay cool like on tax right I just feel like it's a lot what is he trying to say I really just didn't understand the purpose of this paragraph what I was trying to understand and I realized like a lot of it is him telling like that gospel in a condensed paragraph yeah it's really sharing Jesus right exactly it's really sharing like who Jesus is in the very beginning we proclaimed to you the one who existed from the beginning and and this is you know something that really is hard for a lot of people to believe and understand is like well if Jesus was born in two thousand years ago and the world has been around this long and God created from the beginning how is Jesus God right how is that possible if Jesus wasn't born so only 2,000 years ago and you know right there it literally tells us that the one who existed from the beginning talking about Jesus who existed from the beginning though he was born in the flesh two thousand years ago he was there with the father from the very beginning because he is God right there is just like a lot of people you know that are out there that you shared the gospel with or this question would come up and it's just a great verse to it to direct then to and it's just so cool because you know they were there John was there with them from the beginning whom we have seen right whom we have heard and seen and you know we get to hear from him who was with Jesus on who Jesus really is and what it looks like to live for him yeah and focusing kind on what Kyle just said they were there like it says we have seen with our eyes we have touch with our hands and I just think it's really cool that we get of like a first-hand witness to Jesus sharing this with us yeah I mean it's amazing it's so powerful and I love how you know they started to go in more on who Jesus really is right it's like he is the word of life Jesus when he was on this earth they didn't have this they didn't have the New Testament they didn't have the gospel written out right like they didn't have this that we have right here right now they had Jesus and Jesus was the word right I mean we look in Scripture and it's Jesus so he is the word he is the word of life you know we are blessed to have the word of life Jesus everywhere we go each and every one of us we're back then you know Jesus could only be in one place at one time with you know whoever was there but he was the word of life he is the word of life and I just love that because so often we don't value this we don't value the Bible we don't value the word as we should because we see it as a bulk right but it's not it's the Living Word it's literally God Jesus right here in our hands and you know it's so funny so many times it's like well I haven't heard from God I don't know if I ever heard from God it's like if you read this you're hearing from God right because he's the word of life so I love that right there and something recently I've been convicted again I'm like I'm not valuing this as I should I need to be in this more because this is the water life yeah that's the main Kyle always says is that what you say or I've heard it somewhere is if you want to hear from God just read the Bible yeah this is gone yeah one of the best ways to hear from verse four it says and we are writing these these things so that our joy may be complete I think that is just such a bold statement because it insinuates that we are not complete with that Jesus and our joy is not complete without Jesus and I think a big thing to focus on during that is what is joy and realizing that joy is not happiness yeah and just I think taking some time to meditate on that and asking yourself okay what is joy and what is happiness and finding the differences so you don't have an unreal unrealistic expectation of what it looks like to follow Christ following Christ doesn't mean you're gonna be happy all the time but it means you're gonna be joyful all the time so it's really important to understand what joy is right and like our joy comes from the Lord you know our joy doesn't come from our jobs our relationships our travels adventures what experiences like know our joy comes from the Lord I mean just to backtrack a little bit at the end of - right it says he is the one who is eternal life and I think that's some point - because that's our joint man like our joy isn't through anything else or anyone else it's through Jesus what he did for us the promise in the hope that we have in him and our salvation through our faith in Him through living for him or salvation here on earth and after for all of eternity is the abundant life in Christ there's nothing better so even when things are going south in our eyes in this world we can still have joy be filled with joy and rejoice in those things because we know he who is the one who is eternal life who is the word of life who existed from the beginning you know who is with us and loves us he is our joy and that's why it's very hard for me to believe when people who don't know Jesus say oh I'm Joey I'm filled with jewelry because I mean I lived most of my life without Jesus and I never experienced jewelry like I had with Jesus it's different I experience happiness happiness is temporary it doesn't last yeah just like you were saying yep and one thing I consider is that joy is not an emotion because emotions are from our flesh and they can't usually be trusted it's also emotions are temporary I don't think there's never been an emotion that I felt from my whole life I think joy is more like the posture of your heart and how you respond and then with that being said if Christ completes our joy that means that nothing else can complete it which means nothing in the world can complete our joy if you're single right now you think your husband is going to like meeting your husband's gonna complete that hole that you think it's not or you might think that once you have a certain amount of money or when you move to this place or when you accomplish that things will be complete but the fact is it says right here that Christ came to complete our joy all right and he already came so that means we can be complete right yeah and that's crazy how simple it really is right and we overcomplicate the crap out of it searching in so many different places so many going to so many different direction is trying to fill this void and and be complete and filled with joy and Jesus just like dude like I already did everything that you need I already did everything for you all you need to do now is put your faith in me trust in me live for me no need my so simple it's so simple I'd say it easy but it's so simple right mm-hmm okay let's move on to five awesome so I'm in the NLT by the way I'll read five through seven here this is the message we heard from Jesus and now declare to you God is light and there is no dark in him at all so we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God but go on living in spiritual darkness we are not practicing the truth but if we are living in the light as God is in the light then we have fellowship with each other and the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin my lord thank you Jesus Wow that's good so when it says God is light and in him is no darkness at all what is up to you yeah I mean you gotta think like God right God who is holy who was pure who is is good who is it's just truth right like this God is literally light there is no darkness in him there's no sin there's no and you know hatred or envy or there's no sin right he is just holy pure and true and we know for a fact that when Jesus is in the picture darkness cannot exist right when when the light goes on you can't have darkness the darkness gets eliminated right but if Jesus isn't in the picture and there's no light darkness is very evident right if there's no light on it's just dark in here there's the darkness so I think when when he's going in on this and saying God is light and there's no darkness and in him at all it makes us really think okay well if God is laying there's no darkness in him at all but I have God in me but there's still darkness in me do I really have God in me mm-hmm that that's rough yeah I think so endure that's a tough pill to swallow man and that's something that we got be honest with ourselves and be humble enough to really look into our own hearts and ask God to search our hearts so we can really see if there is darkness in us because you know going into verse 6 so we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God go on living in spiritual darkness we are not practicing the truth yeah and I think one thing I asked myself was what is darkness exactly so I looked up a bunch of other 500 verses about darkness and anytime it references darkness it's talking about sin or like walking in the world or with the devil so when I see darkness it's like okay we don't walk in our sin question I wrote down to reflect on is in what ways do we walk in darkness so I think that's just something you guys can all think about and ask yourself and ask God to reveal what ways you are walking in darkness I think it's interesting that it says walk in darkness because I feel like walking in is intentionally staying because obviously God knows we all we're gonna be sin in our life but I think the fact that it's walking in the Sun it's like insinuates that were having a choice of what direction weren't going and we're choosing to walk in that direction which is dark yeah that's good this is where like repentance comes into play yeah but you know when we're walking in darkness majority of time we don't realize we are or we're blinded to see the truth of the matter so when you're walking in darkness it's hard to see good and evil like think about the ring being pitch-black mm-hmm right you have good over here evil over here you can't see it's all dark but once you turn the light on you see oh here's good here's evil I could go with the good right we can choose button so we we have the light aka Jesus we don't see that we're blind by which is why Jesus said on the cross forgive them father for they do not know just all walking in darkness yeah I don't know yeah hey seriously so so with that being said you know like she was talking about like we're walking in this darkness but once Jesus comes in our lives he shows us you know which way we should go what we should do how we should live for him and then it's up to us to choose but at that point the blinders are off yeah and we know what's good what's evil you know first seven says but if we go on living in the light as God is in the light then we have fellowship with each other in the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all our sins and that's such a beautiful promise right because it's like yea we are sinners we do sin we're made righteous and right you know in his eyes through Jesus through the righteousness of Christ but how beautiful is it that even though we're flawed and we're gonna mess up that if we choose that fellowship with God and one another dude is blood cleanses us of all persons and we're forgiving this is a great verse to meditate on or to send one of your friends or something who claims they know Jesus but it's just fine what their sin and just keeps going back to sin it's not like they're heartbroken over it or really convicted about it they're just like yeah I love Jesus but like this is my lifestyle this is a really good verse for them to focus in on if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us Wow yeah so this paragraph or those few verses really just set me on fire and I was like what because if you see 9 it starts with the word if which is conditional it's saying okay then 9 it says if we confess our sins then he will do this right which means there is so much importance in confession and I think I get some messages that are like why do I have to confess like I'm God already forgave me there is so much importance like here it says if we confess it doesn't say he's just gonna do it it just says if we confess just to forgive us our sins and I think there is so much important in confession and I think that is the biggest thing that Christians get wrong is they pretend they don't sin yeah and that's why everybody wants to tear us apart it's because we pretend we're perfect when we really should be telling everyone how much we suck and how good Jesus is because if we try to keep any of that glory or righteousness for ourselves like we're such good people right then we are gonna misrepresent what a Christian is so badly cuz we all mess up right and I think just Christians need to confess our sins to each other and stop trying to pretend we're Jesus we're not and if we keep doing this that's why so many people are so quick to call out Christians for their sins because they won't admit their sins themselves and they're putting on this facade that they are Jesus and they are without sin of course we strive to not sin and we try to be the best people we can be but yeah that's good I mean that's what's walking the spiritual darkness too right if you're walking in this place of I'm perfect taking the glory for yourself I mean she who did that first saying yeah he wanted all the glory he wanted all the praise right he was like the worship leader basically and he wanted it all right and it's like if we take that glory from him and we're not honest and truthful about you know our own lives and to put it bluntly how much we suck okay then how amazing Jesus is we too are living in spiritual darkness and we're taking that glory from God and we are going back not practicing the truth and not living in the light so you got to ask I mean if I'm doing that is really Jesus's blood cleansing me right now because here it says God his life we have fellowship each other than the blood of Jesus cleanses us from our sins if we confess then he is just and loving in our sins are forgiven one thing I wanted to say on the is something that the girls said they heard in the sermon about self-righteousness and it said the pastor said when I disassociate myself from the sin of humanity I removed myself from underneath the blood that was shed for it oh wow think about that for a second yeah disassociate myself from the sin of humanity I removed myself from underneath the blood that was shed for me Wow yeah so I think that so many Christians do all the time you might want to separate themselves for all the sin of humanity but that's who Jesus had for like shed his blood for so yeah that that really hit me just a touch on verse 10 again if we claim we have not sinned we are calling God a liar yeah showing that his word has no place in our hearts me once upon a time but no like heck no and we have to really think that's hard guys we sin we mess up but God loves us he's forgiven us and his blood cleanses us and it's a beautiful gift that God has given us we don't need to reject it you know we can receive that and be open and honest and let God get all the glory one of the biggest keys here for me would truly be like confess confess your sins man you know give it to God yeah that's the best year samanage geez yes confess your sins men and women but confess man that was a big laugh for you know your laughs I'm in faith why do you think okay keep going what what the battery's gonna die last thing I want to kind of talk about before you wrap up is one of the girls caught this when we were reading this and it says God is just and oh they were saying like so many people want to focus on qualities of God that make us feel good like it's faithfulness and his love not as equally parts just sometimes I think he really does let us walk out the consequences of our sin because he's just and he will forgive us but if we're choosing to sin like we're choosing to be hurt because sin hurts us and I just think about Jesus and how God let himself his son literally go through that to suffer the consequences of everybody sin I think he would do the same for us you know it's like we can't look at our lives when things are going really wrong and we're not really living for God and be like you know what is wrong with and start pointing the finger at him we also can't do that when things we are living for him and things aren't going right in our eyes because God's got a plan and it's much better we could ever imagine but understanding that he is just it's very very very crucial and important to understanding you know how God calls us to live Jesus Jesus is the portion of our righteousness that just goes like just self-righteousness is Jesus is the only portion of our righteousness like there is nothing inside me that should be righteous cos I am a sinning mix sinner pants yeah I mean we put on the righteousness of Jesus ya know if we had our own righteousness we wouldn't need the righteousness of Christ yeah yeah doughnut yeah good job they're gonna be open or fresh no they're not gonna be fresh okay all right guys that is where we're gonna wrap up this study on 1st John 1 we would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below if you guys want more videos like this please give it a thumbs up and also also share it with any friends you think would enjoy it as much as this is for you guys this is for us maybe Jesus but it's true I mean we all need Jesus made so this is this is just such a blessing and a gift and you know we just I thought you guys would continue to pray for us that we would steward this blessing you know properly you know the way that God calls us to I think I've reached my end I'm ready for the doughnut what that was aggressive it's not gonna be fresh all right we love you love you have a good peacemaker I'm a peacemaker peace shaker like - I'm not gonna laugh at you cuz you're not funny that's my fiancee hello everyone welcome back to the channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne i am sorry for the lack of videos last week if you follow me on instagram i have kept you guys updated on there so if you're not following me there make sure you are so you kind of know what's going on definitely a lot of videos on the way this video is going to be mine and kyle's apartment hunting journey and we are really excited if you guys don't know kyle he is my fiance and we are looking for a place to move into once we are married the plan is that i will move in probably a month before the wedding and get everything set up and then kyle will move in after the wedding day first i wanted to give you a rundown of what exactly we were looking for so we are looking in arizona specifically north scottsdale and south scottsdale area we kind of want to stay within 15-20 minutes of central scottsdale which is called old town if you don't mind living a little bit further away from old town you can get better deals and more space the apartments that are in old town i think are just overpriced for what you are getting as far as budget me and kyle use the dave ramsey budgeting tool called every dollar we've been doing it for three months now i think so we have a really great idea of how much money we make each month and also what we can afford and i think that is so important when you're looking for an apartment is to really budget out what price points would keep you comfortable me and kyle are looking at one bedrooms and two bedrooms the second bedroom would be used as an office space so that's why we're considering both we are looking for one bedroom starting at a thousand one hundred dollars a month and we are looking at two bedrooms that are starting about thirteen hundred dollars a month our max budget would probably be definitely not over sixteen hundred so if we were to get a two bedroom we would want it to be around fifteen hundred dollars or less obviously every area in the us is different i think it's always fun to watch these videos because you gotta get an idea of what you can get for your money in different places of the world so if you're apartment hunting in phoenix this is kind of what to expect so let's get in to the apartments so the first apartment we visited was in north scottsdale we definitely know we're not going to live here so i will let you know the name and all the details in the description below this one's called 90 degrees i just felt like this one was a little bit overpriced for what you get the apartments were on the smaller side one bedrooms were about 550 square feet to 650 square feet we really did love the features it was a beautiful apartment i like the high ceilings i like the appliances i like the countertops um all the finishes on everything work great uh the one bedrooms started at about twelve hundred fifty dollars but none of them were really like sticking out to us or felt super homey another thing we didn't like was the light in the apartments you a lot of them were facing inwards towards like the pool area or the amenities area which actually isn't great for light because the other building blocks the light from coming in and light is a huge thing that we are looking for it's honestly one of the most important things to us is having good natural light obviously for filming so that is where we were at with building number one we saw a couple different versions of the one bedroom a few different floor plans for that and then he let us look at one of the lofts i have always loved lofts i think they are so cool um the one he showed us actually rented that day so it was no longer available however he just let us look for fun this loft rented for fifteen hundred dollars he said that was the lowest he has seen it but these lofts are one bedrooms but they do have a little bonus space and they typically rent for upwards of sixteen hundred dollars in the north scottsdale area we ended up ruling that one out we just didn't think you got a lot for your money and it just didn't really feel like home so the next place we went was also in north scottsdale and we absolutely loved this one the first one we saw was a two bedroom and uh we just i mean there was so much light as soon as you walked in the apartment i really loved the unique design the cabinets were like a really pretty color and also these cool tiles in the kitchen i just felt like the whole place had a really homey warm feeling i also loved the nine foot ceilings and just all the little details like the built-ins and the carpet was really soft and the windows were really big so we really did love this specific unit it was amazing however it was upwards more closer to sixteen hundred dollars um after everything said and done plus you have to think you have to basically add on 200 to 300 um in other bills like your utilities your electric your water sewer trash as well as this specific apartment charges a 50 hoa fee because of the area that it's in so with all that added in it kind of broke the budget a little bit however we really love this so we are considering moving into a one bedroom which is what we toured next we looked around the one bedroom however both the one bedrooms we saw the lighting just wasn't great however the apartment was really spacious so for the price that they have it at you get a lot more bang for your buck compared to the last place we visited so you're getting a lot more square footage all i can say is i just really love all the finishes they're really unique and just different from everything else we toured this is definitely one of our favorites apartment number three was also in the north scottsdale area these ones started at one bedroom started at 13.50 which i think were high i've been looking on the website and the prices do fluctuate down to about 1200 and sometimes yeah probably about 1200 is the lowest i've seen their one bedrooms at um we did like these apartments i did like the finishes we definitely would have gotten the upgraded version um like the renovated version because the non-renovated was really ugly but yeah we liked all the features it had great high ceilings they did have some big windows this specific community is only two stories and that's something we definitely consider we want to be third story fourth story if possible second story isn't bad but a lot of the times with second story you're not getting a lot of light honestly these ones were kind of at the top of our list but we weren't loving it i we did like the second layout that we checked out because it had a den and we just really loved that bonus room however it definitely was priced like a two bedroom that unit i believe was 1500 or sixteen hundred dollars it's a one bedroom but with that bonus space they definitely charge you like it was a second room we didn't love that the countertops in this specific unit were dark we love the light countertops and the other one we toured so there were just a few things that we didn't love i really did like the living room space the fireplace the kitchen was a great size there was just a few details that we didn't love and for that price you might as well just get a two bedroom two bath because they're charging you for it okay apartment number four was definitely on the lower budget this was in south scottsdale phoenix area so more towards the college campus and this one the one bedroom started at about a thousand dollars so it's definitely more affordable it was the most affordable apartment that we toured however if you guys look at it you can see you get what you pay for these units were really tiny starting at about 500 square feet for a one bedroom and i personally would like 650 square feet or up especially because i'm gonna be living like two people are gonna be living there so we want more space so um the upgrades they did were nice however the ceilings were pretty low it really to me just felt like i was kind of trapped in a chamber um it's like those places that they update but for some reason it still has this feeling of kind of just old and dark and cold we kind of ruled these out pretty much after we saw them fifth apartments we toured were town homes and these were really beautiful and what we loved is that it includes a garage plus there's stairs within the home because it's a townhouse so you get a first level and second level and we just thought that was really awesome because it makes it more feel like your house rather than an apartment you're renting so we really love that feature however townhomes sell really fast so you have to act quick and the availability is limited because there's not as many units available as apartment buildings usually have a ton of units like hundreds whereas townhomes i don't even know if they have like 80 units available so finding a unit that we loved in our time frame and in our budget was the challenging part they didn't have any one bedrooms that were renovated which was unfortunate because the non-renovated ones had like they were painted like a taupe color and for filming i really want light walls and also the updates they had these really old school white appliances they had dark countertops and i just really would have preferred a place with all those um renovations some things we loved about these townhomes is the ceilings were really high they had big windows however the townhomes are kind of enclosed to each other kind of gives you like this italy feel because you kind of look out and you see everybody's patios but with that it doesn't allow a lot of light to come in that main living room and also the bedroom so you're not getting as much light so that was something we didn't love these were really beautiful town homes we loved the two bedroom however it still just didn't feel like home and it would have been stretching the budget the renovated two bedrooms ranged from 6.50 to upwards of 1700 so we kind of are leaning more towards no however we're still keeping it in the back of our mind if something comes available okay the sixth apartment that we toured was a really good deal it was a great bang for your buck the area was kind of secluded and the amenities weren't the best but the units themselves were really big they had very spacious one bedrooms you get a lot of square footage the ceilings are really high everything's very updated the cabinets were a little bit dark for my preference however it was still beautiful and modern and yeah we ended up touring a one bedroom and a two bedroom at this place the one bedroom actually came with a bonus room which was the den however there was no windows in the den and basically we would have used that space for my office and filming room and since there was no windows it was kind of useless to us because we really need the natural light so we didn't love that floor plan but then we went to the two bedroom and the floor plan was pretty good it was so big huge windows um just so much space you get a huge two big closets two big bathrooms just it was awesome for the space and the value so the one bedrooms at this place start at about 12 25 but they randomly had two units that were available that were two bedrooms that were only 13 like 50 i believe which is really cheap for a two bedroom um with those upgrades and that much space it was a really good deal so we were really considering moving into this place however we checked out the specific unit that we would have gotten at that place we did a walk by and i'll show you the picture there was a palm tree that blocked all of the sun from coming in to the room that would have been my office and that is just something i really want if we're going to get a two-bedroom it's going to be my office it's going to be a filming room and i need light in there and this palm tree just straight up blocked that specific unit from getting all of the light we're on the list to be contacted in case another apartment opens up there um but yeah that deal those prices were so low we would have been stupid not to take it i don't think it really felt like home to me like i didn't get the feeling like this is the one it was more like this is a really good deal all right the last place we looked at was brand new apartments these were just built so the pricing definitely reflects it none of these units have been lived in we toured two of them the first one was a one bedroom as you can see they have these huge 11 foot vaulted ceilings which are absolutely beautiful everything is updated i mean it's brand new it was honestly a really beautiful apartment these one bedrooms start at 1300 so it's definitely reflected in the price however they were really spacious um we would have probably tried to get a unit facing outwards instead of facing the amenities that way we could get more sunlight um they did have a special going on so that would have brought in one of the one bedrooms down to 12.49 so it was in our budget so we were definitely considering this one i mean still are considering we haven't made a decision as of when i'm filming this but yeah these were really beautiful lots of space big bathrooms big bedrooms we um toured two one-bedroom layouts and then we decided to peek into the two bedroom which was a mistake because guys this two bedroom was so beautiful it was a corner unit so it had so many windows it had so much space just huge windows in every room but that sucker started at seventeen hundred dollars maybe eighteen hundred dollars for that one um because it was a corner unit their other two bedrooms start at fifteen 40 and guys these prices definitely vary depending when you go there what time you guys want to move in they they change every day so i try if i really like an apartment i try to definitely go to their website every day to see how the prices fluctuate and when would be the best time to um rent from them so that is something to consider so those are all the apartments we've toured so far we have three more appointments today so another apartment hunting video may be coming soon so stay tuned for that i hope you guys enjoyed please let me know in the comments which apartment was your favorite i would love to have you around so please subscribe to the channel give this video a thumbs up and i will see you guys very soon in some videos that i have coming up love you guys bye you o i'm just documenting the process of getting out of the spiritual rug let me tell you i don't want to do this but that is the devil and my flesh and that's because i am a simple person oh you guys you can just see me cry officially this video really helped me get out of my spiritual rut good morning i just woke up and today's video is going to be about getting out of a spiritual slump is that what people call it i don't know anyway i have not been reading my bible unless i'm at bible study and i have not been experiencing god's sure and all the other blessings that come with following jesus because honestly i have not been pursuing god i've been very distracted by other things and i think i have willingly chose to ignore pursuing god right now i don't know i'm just being very honest because this is like how am i supposed to sit in front of the camera and tell you how to get out of a spiritual rut unless i do it myself and show you literally what it's like so i'm just documenting the process of getting out of a spiritual right instead of sitting down after the fact because you guys need to see the in between and then nitty gritty so this morning i woke up and i went on my phone and that's like the biggest thing that i shouldn't do is go on my phone when i wake up because then it is very unlikely that i'll read anything when we go on our phones right in the morning i feel like it puts in a bunch of thoughts into our head and it taints when we are reading experience basically so because i went on my phone and i was texting the bachelorette group chat then when i went to read i kept thinking about things that i wanted to do related to that so that's my first piece of advice is really just do not go on your phone and usually especially in the mornings i'll try not recently because like i just admitted to you guys i have not been reading my bible or doing anything in the mornings but turning your phone on airplane mode so there's no notifications when you wake up i started today with a devotional i find easing my way back with a devotional always helps because i think opening up the bible for some reason it's probably the devil can be just like so it feels like such a mental challenge you know so i'm gonna use my word i read today's devotional it's all about needing and our needs first wants and how god knows everything we need however a lot of our desires as sinners we convince ourselves that we need it and then those needs turn into expectations that we put on god and what he should give us and what we need and then it really leads to a lot of unhappiness this devotional is called new morning mercies i'll have it linked in the description i really like it it's very in-depth and it's not like any other devotional i've read that are kind of just like i don't know i think it just makes you think and it's definitely more convicting than some other devotionals that i've read that are kind of more like not as challenging it gives you a verse to go to um for further study and encouragement i wish i mean he does reference scripture in here i just wish there was like a verse of the day as well but i guess that's what's at the bottom it's several several verses which i think is awesome most times when i wake up i go straight to waking up kyle and then i don't do my devotional sometimes we'll do devotionals together but i think right now it's really important for me to get my reading at least a little bit of reading before i even see kyle so i can treat him better you know okay i just read first corinthians 10 1-13 well something that i forgot to do is pray so i would highly recommend praying before you read the word um i forgot to do it but usually i'll just pray like that the holy spirit would speak through this and just help me understand what i'm reading and i think that can make a huge difference in understanding along with this i might read something else that kind of gives me some wisdom and encouragement to live by today thing to read is just first corinthians 13 to remind me about love that's always a good one to read in the morning so i'm gonna read that just read first corinthians 13. now i'm gonna pray honestly i have not been praying to start my day guys i've been bad i've been not bad the enemy has really i don't know what am i supposed to say i'm just trying to confess one thing to know when you're trying to get out of a spiritual spiritual rut is that the enemy doesn't want you to and so you have to be aware of spiritual warfare and make sure you protect yourself in that and just you're aware that maybe it's not your flesh that doesn't want to do it maybe it's the enemy trying to keep you from doing it so let's pray father god i just pray over this day and this weekend and everyone who's watching this video god i just pray that you help us seek you first and put you first and that we would just lay down any distraction that gets in the way god i just pray for eyes and ears for spiritual warfare that you would protect me against the enemy's lies and schemes god i just cast all that out any heaviness that the enemy has put upon me this day i just cast it out in the name of jesus i just pray that we would all feel your joy and your presence and your love today god that you would teach us something new about ourselves that you would bring a unique conviction to us today that uh you would just show us an area that we need to improve to become more like jesus but i just thank you that we have access to you that we can talk to you that we have a relationship with you just bring me to tears just kidding i'm yawning so god i just thank you for all of this um i just ask that you give me the strength to continue to pursue you even when the devil or my flesh tells me i'm too tired or you could do something else   gets consumed by social media god i just pray that you just give me self-control to stop doing all those things and instead focus my attention on you so i just thank you for who you are for your son and for everybody watching this thank you you're the best i love you because i suck on my own and i need you in jesus name he meant i'm always in between if like having these face frame pieces look cute or they look grimy i do need to wash my hair so they probably look a little more grimy today but i got ready having some breakfast watching a youtube video and well let's just say i could have put on a sermon you know and that's what i should do or like a bible study but let me tell you i didn't want to i wanted to watch this video about the truth about influencers i don't know i just wanted to put on something that was comfortable and light-hearted and easy to watch and this is what happens when you're trying to get out of a spiritual rut is there's just sometimes you're just not gonna want to do it but honestly because you guys are watching that's actually really helping a lot but yeah i just watched 15 minutes of this video it's over now and now i'm gonna go through my closet and list some things to sell on depop so now i'm gonna put on a sermon so when i was honestly my most joyful self it was when i was watching like sermons when i got ready i would basically start off every morning with a sermon because i just wanted to know more about jesus and i honestly have not done that in such a long time i don't even remember the last time i chose to put a sermon on over a youtube video and that's bad for me that's bad for me i hate labeling things as good and bad that's not the best decision for me so that is something i think i can start doing in my mornings while i'm cleaning or just doing a task where i usually just put on someone's youtube video that i could put on a sermon instead so that's what i'm gonna do today and again let me tell you i don't want to do this but that is the devil and my flesh and that's because i am a sinful person but that's just what happens when you're in a rut you really need to force yourself past what you want to do this guy name is named zac poonen and he's like 80 something years old the lady i live with loves him she watches him all the time she recommended this sermon it's called it's about young married couples i like to listen to it um on like one and a half speed because he talks pretty slow it's like listening to your grandpa give you advice one thing i really love about him is that he doesn't accept a salary for being a pastor like he doesn't get paid he doesn't get a salary from the church and he doesn't believe in that and also he's just a very has a very calm spirit and is just very aligned with god's truth and he just clearly doesn't have any ulterior motives i think a lot of times i lean more towards watching famous pastors because they are more entertaining and that's not what you know reading the bible's about it's not about being entertained so sometimes we have to challenge ourselves to watch videos like this that aren't so flashy and entertaining and have the best production or the best quality or the best personality behind it sometimes we just need to watch something because we love jesus and we want to get to know his truth so i'll leave this video in the description if you guys are interested but yeah i'm going to turn this on and then go clean my room or something i don't know i'm crying we're on the period coaster no yes we are it should be like woohoo but it's like oh no i asked you guys for advice on what did you get out of a spiritual rut and some people said to cry oh crying's good what did that be i don't know what's wrong with me it's your time of the month no i'm unhappy because there's little things that are being escalated because it's your time in the moment you just said your period was extended yeah i shouldn't have my period today but i do it lasts a day longer well i wish i could help you with it no i'm not myself no that's not myself ever that's not true that's what it feels like i feel like i haven't been happy in a while guys pray for cayenne that she could rejoice in the suffering rejoice through the unknown the pain the confusion like a roller coaster right i wish i could go on a roller coaster i like rolling i know you do but so you're kind of you can't go on well you're going on an emotional roller coaster i don't like emotional roller coasters i know but it's better than nothing i finished the sermon good job finally   see that's like a flip in the roller coaster women if you have any tips for this guy on how to help this girl let me know hook a brother up with some advice just stay calm i need some wisdom just stay calm just don't get frustrated with me no we're on a roller coaster we're trying to get a video out to you guys but i can't this could be the video this isn't my life i can't oh you guys you'll get to see me cry you're so beautiful even when you cry why do i want to cry sometimes we just gotta let it out why do i sound stupid there you go yeah so my voice sounds stupid it sounds very whiny yeah i saw like one i mean you sound amazing babe you sound fantastic this is good i feel like doing this right now is helping you you guys you guys help her better than i can hmm yeah yeah okay i'm gonna go process stuff bye it is day three of getting out of a spiritual run uh the first night i ended up having a really nice cry session yes that night i mean the first cry session that i got on film was more of like a whiny period cry and then that night i had more of like a breakdown cry and kyle prayed for me and that is one way definitely that i would recommend to get out of a spiritual rut is have other people pray for you um who are strong because it's really hard to pray for yourself during those times because you feel so like defeated already so having someone else pray for you can be really helpful so that's something i would recommend and then yesterday honestly was day two i didn't do anything to help myself get out of a spiritual run and that's also a thing is like it's not going to happen overnight and it's definitely something you have to get in the habit of doing again like doing things to help but yeah i didn't read anything from the bible yesterday i didn't do any devotionals yesterday but today's a new day we're listening to worship music in the car and we are going not just listening we are worshipping baby yeah we're worshipping which is another thing you guys recommended on instagram is to just worship and i think that's something i wish we could go in person to uh we probably could have gone but instead we're going to house church but that's another thing getting into community with believers that's really helpful if possible where you are so that's where we're going right now we're going to pick up some donuts and we all do like a brunch in house church so i'm sure this will be really good for my spirit i'm feeling better today my period's over so i think my i think my my emotions are at a better place come here just melt in your mouth what is that like what krispy kreme fresh glazed doughnuts the best glazed donut i've ever had in my life it's pretty good what it's pretty good no no baby you gotta try again what do you mean pretty good that's not pretty good it melts in your mouth you taste it fresh out of the oven yeah you should get painted by krispy kreme for this promotion okay all right let's bring all these donuts to church okay so another thing that i realized the other night was that my thought life has been really um unhealthy and something that we were watching a message um a couple weeks ago and the pastor was talking about ephesians 6 16 and it talks about the devil and his fiery darts and it says to take up the shield of faith the shield of faith to protect against these and in his message he kind of talked about this as your thoughts and the the devil likes to send fiery arrows at your mind and then these just get planted in your head and that's how the enemy likes to keep us down a lot of the times and i was just reflecting the other night and that is really what the enemy has been doing um i've just been focusing on a lot of negative things just things that i want to change i've been very ungrateful and i've been complaining a lot and that has definitely impacted my mental health and how happy i am so it makes me think about the other verse which i looked up it's um philippians 4 8 and it just tells us to focus on things that are pure and truth and write and i think that just goes to show like our thought what we think on and what we dwell on is really important so that is something i'm going to try to do and like yesterday i guess when we were driving we kind of like went through things we were grateful for so i think that will help as well yeah it's the attitude of gratitude it's so powerful i mean god talks about guarding our hearts right protecting our hearts and our thoughts end up you know directing our hearts yeah um so we gotta be careful with our thoughts too which is why he's big on that and just be grateful one of my favorite verses first thessalonians 5 16 through 19. i like all the way to 22. i like it all but what is it that one is i i know the part you're referring to is give things right rejoice always pray without ceasing give thanks and all things for this is the will of your father lovely chatty yep good morning today is day four yesterday church was really awesome that definitely helped being in community definitely helped and just spending time listening to a message when we go to church in person that is really amazing as well for your spirit but depending on your options right now you might not be able to do that today kyle has to go to court he's a bad boy i did a bad thing he got a ticket like months ago for parking and they kept pushing it back so it finally is here they also kept changing the charge okay that this video is not about kyle's ticket you defend yourself in court listen i need no you defend yourself i need some practice to prepare i would have ideally like to start my day with a devotional but we had to get up early and i slept into the very last i was about to say i don't know about getting up early i just brought everything in the car so we could do it together while we drive let's go to make sure i'm staying focused on god i also bought our book brought our book the meaning of marriage because we haven't look how much we've gone through not very much yes we need to start it off strong yeah and then we stopped reading so we'd really like to get through this book and maybe one other before we're married so yeah i'm just gonna do that we have a nice 30 minute drive so plenty of time to talk about jesus right that's right all right good morning guys it is now wednesday i'm pretty sure this is day six or day seven of this video and i just wanna give you a rundown me and kyle have been good about starting our days with a devotional um on the bible app right now we're doing this one it's called reset your mind i'll have it linked in the description it's really great especially with what i've been struggling with which is a lot of negative thoughts so highly recommend that and then i went to a bible study so me and kyle both go to a bible study on tuesday nights he goes with the guys i go with the girls i actually got the chance to lead it last night and we went through first john two the second half of first john two because last week we only got like halfway through first john 2 and it was a really awesome bible study and it was just really nice to be around women and we were all laughing and really getting deep into like theology and just it was really great to spend time in the word with other women and it be like a mixture between light-hearted but also like deep theology so that was really helpful so i definitely would recommend if you are able to start a small bible study and um this morning we started our day with the devotional again they'll reset your mind and i just wanted to talk about kind of what we learned and kind of what the devotional is about so this devotional is all about your thoughts and taking your thoughts captive making sure you're focusing on um things of above and not things of this world which i believe is in colossians 3 2 and that this has just really been helping me today was focusing on things up above and it kind of asks you is there anything you are watching listening to like podcasts books um tv shows social media is any of that triggering negative thoughts in your head or worldly thoughts if so it asks you to fast for them for 21 days and see the difference it makes i think that's huge for me i don't think mine are stemming from anything possibly i think social media could influence if i'm watching um a lot of content of people maybe living a certain lifestyle or living a married life that can trigger a lot of discontentment in my thoughts because i want to be married um because it feels like it's taking forever but i i just that could be triggering for sure um we kind of went through different shows we watch and just asked ourselves are any of these triggering negative thoughts truly believe that over these past few weeks i've just been focusing on negative thoughts instead of focusing on god and it really impacted me mentally i honestly got to a point where i felt i didn't feel like myself at all i wasn't laughing i wasn't goofing around i was really just focusing on how discontent i was and how badly i wanted to move how badly i wanted to be married and i wasn't focusing on really the blessings that god had given me or just got at all so that was a huge realization and you guys can probably tell in my voice from the beginning of this video till now i feel so much better and i really wanted to keep filming this video until i was actually out of my spiritual rut um i didn't want to just like sit down and give you some tips i wanted to actually document the process of the highs and lows and as you guys saw three days in i was still a hot mess um but i pushed through and it's not like i'm doing anything super crazy it's not like i'm reading the word five hours a day or something it's starting my day with a devotional going to bible study um putting on worship music it's um really focusing on good things good positive things that's making a huge difference and lifting my spirits so much more i think praying has been really helpful and just constantly just whenever my mind is idle just start praying because my friend justine was talking last night and she said you know an idol mind is the devil's playground and i think with everyone's circumstances right now a lot of us have idle minds because we're not distracting ourselves with a lot of the activities because we're you know quarantined in quarantine and a lot of places are open so our minds are very idle and i think the devil is using that to attack us because um we're just leaving our minds open for thoughts to pop in and we're not putting all of that focus onto god and i think that's exactly what has been happening my mind has been very idle and that allowed the devil to really attack me in my thought life and it really influenced me and just my overall like spiritual health so yeah if you have an idle mind right now i just encourage you to press into something join a bible study pray read the word watch sermons and over time give it time but you will see a difference it's not going to happen overnight but i did this for one week and i literally feel like a different person i feel back to myself again which is just the best feeling ever so let me pull up some of your suggestions and then i will let you guys know what they are and then we'll wrap up the video by the way these glasses are from diff i get a lot of questions on these but i'll have them linked in the description if they're still available okay let's get into your suggestions um you guys sent in hundreds so thank you so much i'm gonna try to read it as many as i can as fast as possible community it helped me a lot just hearing other people's stories sit in silence for 10 minutes every day just wait and listen pick a sermon at random on youtube or spotify learning from outside my own church and pastor helps talk with friends about faith topics continue listening to sermons and reading scripture until breakthrough happens tell a friend who can be accountable with you also serve others and less focus on yourself i love that i take a different posture when i pray to help refocus my heart that's a great idea like get on your knees and pray or literally just change the way you're sitting i also like to pray out loud i can't even go back to praying in my head i mean sometimes i pray in my head but i love praying out loud if you guys don't pray out loud try it it's literally like you're just having a conversation with god and i'm just like god i pray for everyone who's watching this video that they would just feel your presence and that they would know who you are and experience your peace and yeah i pray for you see praying can be very simple spend way more time in prayer and having gratitude so true when you feel you need more god in your life you actually need to put god at the center amen that's good find devotionals that ask intentional questions actively engage in combos and keep worshiping someone says watch a sermon lots and lots of worship music spend time in god's nature praying the holy spirit provides you peace oh wait she's just praying for me thank you uh fruits of prayer do not depend on your feelings so pray even in faith droughts wow y'all are y'all are good god is good through you read good spiritual books listen to sermons or podcasts pray pray pray until you feel jesus this person says she usually does a social media fast i love that idea keep reading the bible because the word makes me alive get lost in worship new songs seem to be released right when god knows i'm what i'm needing uh listen to podcasts mix it up ask holy spirit how to spend time with him example painting worship reading hiking read a bit of the bible that excites you like your favorite character it's intentionally spending time with just myself to figure out what's keeping that one got cut off read a smaller section of scripture and look up the meaning behind it watch christian content oh this one is continued read a small section of scripture and look up the meaning behind it and then journal about the verse and pray just sit and listen to worship music and see what god speak speaks to me it usually helps check out the bible binge podcast to hype me up i love the bible binge i'm using fun fun pens it looks pretty and it's fun repent going back to jesus saved me like peter in the water my friend maddy said her husband is great at waking me up and reminding me how much i need jesus in these moments yeah have someone who can text you in the morning and remind you how much we need jesus be intentional in your time with the lord make it a habit and just do it watch testimony videos on youtube so i can marvel at the power and beauty of jesus amen i just let god know i don't want to get in the word but i have but i want to have that desire then i read part of the bible i love even if it's a little or listen to a worship song this person said visiting a new church that i'm interested in and taking the drive awesome there are so many more but i hope just this quick run through helped in some way i hope you guys enjoyed this video i hope god uses this some way in your life to help you during a hard time and honestly if anything selfishly this video really helped me get out of my spiritual rut but i just want to thank you for all your prayers that probably had a big part of it your prayers really did help me so thank you for anyone who's praying for me i appreciate it i love you guys so much i hope you enjoyed this video let me know if you guys want to see um any other spiritual related content just leave me suggestions in the comments i love you guys so much bye hello you really were you planning that that then it worked it did not work welcome to our empty apartment tour we got the keys um so if you guys saw our apartment hunting video this was actually the one that we love the most however we were looking for like the right unit the right one bedroom we ended up coming back i just had this place on my heart like i really wanted to live here and i couldn't stop thinking about it and i couldn't stop calling them so i was like we should go back and see if they have any other things we can tour we ended up touring this unit but the thing is it was available right away and it was not gonna last long yeah so basically we were here looking around and we were like blown away i'll insert some of the footage of when we first came and toured you'll see how ecstatic we both work yeah it's beautiful oh my gosh yeah look at how many windows look at these oh my gosh i'm gonna pass out then we got on the phone with them and they said if you're interested definitely apply because someone else said that they're gonna apply today and whoever applies first gets it which could have totally just been a really smart business tactic but possibly but i don't care i know i knew like if we didn't get this place i would have been really sad yeah and that's how i knew it was the one right and then it did end up going that would have been a bummer it would have been such a bummer so i got on my phone right away i was asked how i was calling frantically i was stressed out for let's say like a solid two days because i didn't hear from them yeah maybe two and a half days so anyway we got the news that we got it and we got the keys we got it we got the keys i'm sorry did you ever do that for you your drum roll never sits well with come on it's just so aggressive look at look at this camera angle i literally need to be like i know in order to be okay anyway let's get into the empty apartment tour we are gonna start unpacking um some of my stuff but for now it's empty so we figured we would give you a walk-through of everything let's walk through it okay okay so this is the view when you walk in the front door if you can talk if you'd like if you want to be in this this is our view so i mean it's a huge room and let me show you the ceilings so much room look at those ceilings also look at this light fixture over here so look at that guy okay yeah so this is like what you see when you walk in if you're looking straight this way from the door and then over here is our kitchen and then we have a little office nook over here so so much room for activities okay so our front door is right here and then immediately to the left is this huge island is this huge island you're going to do this yeah i don't know we'll find out and it has these really cool waterfall um countertops i love that they also have outlets on here but yeah everywhere yeah they have this huge island come follow me into my crib welcome this is where all the magic happens what the cooking the cleaning the eating the eating   oh that's cool i didn't realize they have the waterfall on both sides yeah baby anyway they have this really nice faucet and a massive love these things i never want to live anywhere without this yeah and yeah this huge farmhouse sink it's like two of my arms and then we have just the kitchen it's kind of like a little bit of a nook over here but i don't mind it but at least we have this big island   tons of cabinet space microwave and then you know this is what the other side of the island looks like so as you can see there's a ton more storage these big cabinets here and the dishwasher over here you could wash like a a puppy in here are you trying to say we should get a puppy maybe i was gonna say baby but that's too soon too soon okay okay so this is kind of like their built-in office space the front door is right here so as soon as you walk in this is on your right i love that there's a nice window right here brings light and yeah it's basically just a built-in desk with some storage so we're kind of going to figure out what we want to do with this um we are thinking that kyle can work from over here this is my little nook and then my workspace i'll set up my own workspace somewhere else in the living room in other words she throws me in the corner and then she gets the whole living room no because nobody kyle nobody puts baby in the corner the thing is if you know what movie that's from drop in the comments i want to know do you know what maybe that's from kyle nobody puts baby in the corner it's a fighting lady right what do you guys think anyway um you're just wild i'm lit   okay success the reason why because i want to use the desk that you built me remember that was the reason why otherwise i could set up my office here and be fine but kyle built me this beautiful desk so if you want me to use it i should is the living room this is what the windows look like it's so cute they have this bench and the windows are just huge and there's so many of them and i love it as you can see in this corner there's kind of like this nook in the floor plan they have this wall with the tv on it and like the couch here facing that wall i don't really know how we're gonna set it up one of you guys actually reached out to me to help with interior designing shout out to ava so hopefully i'll be meeting with her and she can give me some tips on how to arrange this space we use it for dancing but for now we have a lot of space for dancing um i was thinking about putting my office in this little nook or maybe making a filming space over here so yeah it's really fun oh my gosh wow let me go let me know what you guys think in the comments of what i should do with this space because i think it would be a cool filming backdrop or to put my office in that corner or should we keep it as a dancing and karate studio   i am taken aback oh yeah okay i already did my hips right up like football   that's so nice we could like leave this open in the winter yeah because in the winter here it's really nice all right so this is the view from the balcony we got a nice big mountain to look at and then there's some nice like desert space oh yeah um in between us and that building next to us so and what's amazing about this is that is east in other words we get morning sunrises over this mountain range yes which is perfect inspiration and motivation to wake up early grab a cup of coffee grab your bible come outside and spend time with god as the sun rises amen i'm excited i'm hyped about this okay once you walk past the living room this is kind of the area bathrooms over here we have a storage closet on this side and then the bedroom is this way so let's show you the bathroom all right this is what the bathroom looks like a lot of storage under the sink i really love this light fixture that they have you can kind of see it better there it's a really cool light fixture and then they have the shower you can't really tell but it's a really nice plain subway tile which i like then we move in to the bedroom and i don't know if you can tell can you put it up a little bit the ceilings follow in this room love the pitch ceilings they're so beautiful this room has one big window over here and then two small windows up top so this is the closet it is pretty spacious it's honestly smaller than the other ones in other units but we don't mind it should be perfect for us oh sorry all right so that is the overview of our place i am so excited probably won't be doing too much like i don't know i probably won't dive into apartment shopping or anything like that for a little bit because we do have to pay for the wedding so it's not the best time for us to buy furniture or anything so well i mean i say that now we'll see yeah we'll see what happens pray for us um but yeah i don't need any furniture right now we're gonna move my bed over here um and then i'll have that to sleep on so that'll be great anyway this is the i hate it so much i hate it so much that was perfect that was so perfect it's too loud this is the you even paused perfect let's do it come on i don't think we're good let's do it you gotta commit what the heck you weren't even touching me you didn't commit you jumped like and then jumped backwards yes where am i going you're jumping over me over you over come on okay that was random all right i love you to break in the new place we are going to watch a movie drink a glass of wine and have an ice cream sandwich um we actually use a projector to watch our movies and benq was kind of enough to send us one a few months ago or not a few months ago i think a month ago and we've been using it literally every night i don't even think we're gonna ever buy a tv because it's so great um you don't need to mount anything on the wall and look how small this thing is about the size of my head but it is super portable so we could bring it with us anywhere it's like so easy to pack another thing is is bluetooth so and it's also like ios capable so i can like airplay a youtube video and it'll literally just project on the screen it's so funny when i was younger i used to we used to have a projector uh it didn't work very well but me and my sisters would always like to set up a projector in our room and watch it so this is very nostalgic for me i love it um it's actually actually at a pretty good price point i would definitely recommend to get this for someone as a gift we have a 10 discount code that will be in the description and i'll have a link to it uh one of my favorite things is that it has built-in apps so i can navigate to like youtube netflix hulu it's all built in i can literally just airplay from my phone you can also like plug in your computer because it has a usbc outlet so all of those features are amazing i would highly recommend it we love it so much and like i said we use it every night it's my favorite is it awesome it's the best my whole wall just turns into a movie theater yeah it literally feels like at the drive-in um do you want to hit the lights so i can show them what it looks like so good in here and it's super crisp so right now i just have it set up to my computer as you can see just plugs in here look how cool this is i don't even think you can even like see how big this is this is awesome it's the whole wall yes stand by it reference this is kyle it's so fun it's   they wild pretty real you hello everyone welcome back to my channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne and i am so excited to be showing you this video i have literally been working on this probably for two months and i spent hours looking for the clothes and let me just tell you this has been a process however i am so proud of this video and all the photos today i'm going to do a video recreating kristin john's photos um instagram photos if you don't know who she is she is absolutely beautiful and has just an amazing heart for people it's actually so funny because when i first um i don't even know if this was when i first became a christian or a little bit before i was a christian i just remember watching kristen's videos and praying to god that he would give me a heart like hers because you can just see jesus's heart shining through her so it's so funny because those were the prayers i used to pray was that i would have a heart like hers because it is the sweetest thing ever so i am super excited to be filming this if you haven't seen these videos before basically you just choose somebody and look through their instagram photos and you do your best to recreate them so that is what i'm doing and if you guys didn't know kristen and her husband marcus recently got in a really bad accident so i believe in the healing powers of jesus so i would just invite you all to pray with me right now over them and then after that we'll get into the video father god i just pray over my brother and sister christian and marcus god i just pray for healing over their bodies in the name of jesus that you would just restore their bodies that they would be able to return to all the activities that they used to do with no pain god i just pray that any pain in their body just be gone in the name of jesus that they would experience miraculous healing and that this would be a greater testimony to your glory god i just pray over their thoughts and their mental health god just any um schemes or lies of the enemy god i just cast that out in the name of jesus just any way he's trying to attack their thoughts god i just pray for healing in that and protection in that that you would just help them focus on heavenly things during this time that they would focus on your love and your joy and that you would just fill them with your spirit and that they would just constantly be receiving your love and your joy and your peace throughout this time god and just one more time i just pray for healing in the name of jesus that all pain be gone i just pray this all in your son's name amen okay let's get in to the video so in this video i recreated some of kristen's photos that i loved also ones that i could kind of find similar outfits or had similar clothing to hers and i documented the entire process of each photo so you could kind of see the behind the scenes of everyone okay i'm in the first outfit i just have this clip i have the exact shirt she does i couldn't find a skirt that was ruffled like hers that i liked so i'm gonna do this one instead so it's obviously gonna be different but hopefully we can achieve the look i just put my hair in this ponytail or a braid and i found a wall that is very similar these are the walls i found so i have my photographer here let's go we're gonna pull over and get the picture all right ready kid so the lighting is a little bit different in her picture the sun is like half on her so we're checking around the corner to see if the sun's better positioned because where i am it's not not so good um this might work a little bit better it's not going to be the same line in the wall but okay it is significantly later more towards golden hour i need to put on my other shirt but i found this wall so we're gonna try here then we might just walk around this area trying to find a wall because the last one did not have a good lighting so let's try this again okay we found this wall last minute because the other spot wasn't working almost got drenched literally the sun is just gone so i'm gonna have to definitely do some editing to make it brighter like hers but i'm hoping one of them we took about 500. i'm hoping one of them maybe 50. hoping one of them will be spot on yes okay one of the most important parts of these photos is the editing style so i don't know exactly which presets that kristen uses however i'm going to be using the dg presets i thought i would just walk you through me editing one specific photo just so you can get an idea of the presets in order to recreate the styling of these photos the color is so important it makes such a difference all of these can be used on lightroom mobile and that is completely free the only thing you have to do is pay for the presets themselves and it's pretty easy to download them and install them so i have them on my phone here if you've never used presets before these ones are super easy to download they have an entire video dedicated to teach you how so i've already installed them on my phone now i'm just going through each of the different presets and trying to pick the one that looks the most similar to kristin's editing style most of these presets are all one click wonders so they make amazing adjustments however because i needed to mimic hers i did have to go in and make a few changes to the coloring and just adjust some of the tones this is the before and after and here's a comparison between the two okay this is the next photo that i'm trying to recreate um i feel like the makeup is pretty close she had a little bit of eye shadow so i did that now i just need to do my hair like hers i have the same scrunchie and then i'm pretty sure i bought the same mirror too and then kyle's is in his outfit this is as close as we could get for him so i'm gonna finish doing my hair that i'm gonna change i have like a gray thermal sweatshirt and like this white jacket to put over so i think it'll be pretty similar so let's do the hair this is what i found for the outfit i got this thermal from american eagle the airy brand and then i found this jacket i literally could not find any jackets that had this pattern all the way down but i know she shops a lot of asos so i found this one i literally spent hours looking for the different outfits from this video this is what the hair looks like it's kind of like funny being so much on the side but that's kind of what it looks like in the picture so i think it'll look better in the photo i also don't know how she gets that like side part to stay but hopefully this looks close enough trying to figure out a place to put this that has better lighting yeah let's try it there we have to hang the mirror up kyle's not happy about it but we can't have it on the desk because then you'll see the desk in it and it's just not going to be at the right placement so we're committed yeah we are definitely committed   okay   so today i'm recreating this photo we are going to go find a similar color wall but i thought i would show you kind of what i'm going to wear for this one this is how i do my makeup really the only thing that matters is my lip color because that's kind of all you can see from her side profile so this is what i'm going to wear i have these pacsun jeans they're high-waisted and a similar denim color to hers then i just have this top that's really similar to hers i pinned all of this together because it usually is a part and i think that will be a better representation of the shirt she has i also have the exact bag i ordered her picking berries bag so i think this one will be pretty spot on okay we found this wall it's a little bit more yellow but i think in the editing i can make it look similar to hers but the texture is really similar so i have the outfit on basically just need to practice my posing and then i think we'll get the shot   okay here's an update ignore my eyebrows i just got them microbladed today but they will look a little bit more natural in a couple days when they start to scab and whatever anyway update on the video kristen actually just posted this photo and i was really excited because i already have that dress i actually bought that dress from lulu's because it was the closest thing i could find to this photo so i bought that dress intending to remake the photo i just showed you but then literally yesterday she posted a photo in the exact dress that i bought and i was like wow this is perfect i'll just recreate this photo instead and now i need to find a crutch so i came to the handy dandy oh you guys can't even see it i came to goodwill because last time i was at goodwill they had crutches so i'm gonna try to find a crutch to take with the photo and then i'll probably take this photo in a few days successfully found some crutches these might be really tall but whatever they were 550 and then i had a 20 off coupon also got some other goodies but these are for another video so we are trying to do the last photo this is what it looks like i showed you guys earlier when i went and got the crutch no in this parking lot and right now we are literally driving around everywhere trying to find a similar background with the vines and the white wall which is pretty difficult so that's definitely not going to be spot on but we're trying to find something as close as possible that might be a good spot this one's a doozy he's got a window we found this one also the back of this building might work do you think the back of it's better yeah because this has a built a window yeah okay we came back to the first spot that we found i'm just gonna put my hair up i got this huge scrunchie i'm pretty sure the one she's wearing is gonna be released on kristen may but it's not out yet so i got this one on etsy i'll have it linked in the description and then i need to get the crutch out of the car       alright guys that is it for this video i hope you guys enjoyed it let me know in the comments which photo was your favorite or which photo you thought i did the best job on i really had so much fun making this video so if you want to see something similar to this let me know in the comments i would love to continue to do fun videos like this and just a reminder if you want to try out the presets that i mentioned in this video and that i used to edit all the photos in this video i will have a link in the description along with a coupon code i love you guys jesus love you guys and i will see you guys soon hello everyone welcome to today's video this is part of my get healthy with me series if you've been following along you know i've been doing these videos for quite a while and this month i decided to change things up i decided to try orange theory and basically the concept of this video was to do orange theory for a month and then document my before and after and basically the impact it had on my body and my experience with it however two weeks in i think to this video orange theory completely shut down so i was only able to do it for a little bit over two weeks but i wanted to still share all the footage and just my thoughts overall holy smokes that was hard that was a 60 minute workout so i signed up today unlimited membership is 159 a month and then on top of that i didn't realize that this doesn't come with it and they don't do rentals right now so i had to buy my own and you don't need to buy one of these however your stats show up on the board and there's different colors for what level your heart rate's in the blue zone green zone orange zone and red zone uh you kind of want to be in a combination of the green the orange and the red the orange and the red zone get you splat points and basically every workout you have a goal to at least hit 12 splat points and that will keep your body in fat burning mode for 36 hours after your workout so i don't know i just love the numbers and the colors because it motivates me throughout my workout to get my heart rate at a certain level it work motivates me to work harder and to get the points and it's all saved in a really amazing app so i just look through the app and it tells you how long you worked out it tells you how many calories you burned it tells you how long you were in each zone and how many splat points you got per workout and i really love that because it's just i don't know it's just very satisfying to look at they also have at home workouts in the app that pair with this so i can actually have this system going while i do one of their at-home workouts which i also really love because it just keeps you more accountable so this thing you can do three payments or forty dollars or you can just pay all up front which is a hundred and something dollars oh my gosh my math 80 90 100 120 dollars for this thing uh you could probably find it used somewhere i don't know but obviously during these times probably wouldn't recommend it anyway first day was a great success i almost pooped my pants i'm not gonna lie i had to leave the treadmill portion in the middle to go to the bathroom because i don't know if i either had to throw up or poop i ended up pooping but i don't know why i'm telling you guys this you know okay well see you next time i work out         check this i'm so sweaty it's monday it's the second week of orange theory i think this is my fifth or sixth class it was an endurance day so we were basically running for 16 minutes straight and then we just did some weights i can definitely feel myself getting better at running i was able to run the full 16 minutes rotating between face pace and push pace for the entire time i didn't have to walk so that's awesome really enjoyed it um something that i've been doing at the beginning of my workouts that really changes everything is the first thing i do is pray for everybody in the room that they would just receive god's love and joy and then i just say some bible verses as i'm running i try to smile while i work out and i tell myself i can do anything through christ who strengthens me so just giving myself those positive affirmations bible verses and just asking god to strengthen me and give give me his joy throughout the workout literally changes everything and i can have so much more fun and i also just thank god for my temple as i'm working out um and just tell myself that like i'm worth this and like you're worthless and you're amazing and really you just gotta be your own hype hype woman so that's what that's how a workout went today but it was awesome i'm really enjoying the workouts i haven't worked out this hard in so long and consistently and the workouts are only 45 minutes right now so it's great so i am gonna keep going what's up as you can see i don't have a ton of footage from the workouts unfortunately i can't really film in there i was able to get one workout on video so that kind of stinks so i thought i would include this try on fitness activewear haul within this video because otherwise you would just see me before and after my workouts and that's not that interesting so i'm excited because purple she is sponsoring this portion of the video and i was really excited to try their workout clothes because i needed new ones i am the most sweaty person ever and there's no way i could wear um the same workout outfit twice without washing it because i get so sweaty so i was really excited to receive some of their stuff i'm going to do a quick try and haul this is actually one of the tops that they sent me what i really love about their stuff is the material is really nice they have removable pads and everything and i love that a lot of their tops have this additional portion so it's kind of like a sports ball but you can wear it longer i was really looking for some high-waisted shorts to wear to work out in arizona it's literally 110 degrees it's really too hot to work out in leggings so the fact that they have these high-waisted shorts uh running shorts it has the built-in spandex and then the shorts kind of over the spandex i love these shorts i would definitely recommend them they are my favorite things i got a close favorite i also love the sweatpants so i'll show you some of the other stuff um and then we'll get back into the video all right the first thing i got is this matching set these are the running shorts i was talking about they have the built-in spandex and they are pretty high-waisted this sports bra has a really cool design on the back and everything is super soft and comfortable i got everything in a size medium this is the same shorts but in black and also this sports bra is really cool in the back i love that these sports bras go really long the next thing were these sweatpants i got these in black and this green color they are so soft and thin these are definitely one of my favorite things that i got i would highly recommend them they're so comfy and then this is the last top it has this mesh design and a cute crisscross back       yesterday the governor of arizona announced that jim's had to close for an additional 30 days so i was really sad um because i thought orange there would have to close however apparently since they are a boutique fitness studio and their max capacity right now is 15 people they are staying open for now so that was really exciting i mean i don't know if you can tell but i just finished my workout today i honestly woke up this morning and did not want to go i was just so tired and sore but i went anyway and i just did what felt right for my body i didn't do any running i just did power walking on incline and sometimes when you're just not mentally and physically there it's okay to just have a a rest day so   orange theory decided to close for five days and that really put in a debt in my plan so i haven't gone the last two days and i was feeling honestly my periods coming and i was eating unhealthy and i was just feeling really just gross and like really craving a workout to help me get on track because honestly when you work out you it just encourages you to take care of your body more i decided to try one of their at-home workouts i like it because you can wear your band while you're doing it so you can still feel like that motivation to get your points and your calories burn and what zones you're in and it's longer that was a 40 minute workout so it kept me going and i literally just put on some youtube videos while i was doing it so it was good i actually got a really good workout i was sweating a ton something big that has been impacting my fitness journey is definitely seeing my therapist if you guys have been following me for a while you know i use faithful counseling which is a christian based therapy service and i really have been loving it i actually just got a new therapist because i moved and you have to get one in your state and my experience with them so far has been amazing and i just love how they send me a lot of scriptures and we focus a lot on what the word has to say about what i'm going through so um in one of my sessions i brought up my health and if you've seen my other get healthy with me get healthy with me videos you know that i struggle with a couple different things one of them is binge eating and another is just like mentally putting a lot of pressure on myself and then crumbling under the pressure and that's something i was really experiencing so in my session we talked about how with the wedding coming up i have been putting more pressure on myself to work out and when i do that i really crack under pressure and it's really not a fun experience for me and it really just puts a lot of heaviness on me and i was just so tired of feeling that way so i talked to my therapist and something they really focused on was the scripture seek first the kingdom of god and these things will be given to you and they sent me a message after our session just to recap kind of what we went over and after that they said god wants you to be a beautiful bride just do his work daily do it as well as you can allowing for mistakes and he will take care of you and this was just such a great reminder that i needed is if any if we want to do anything in life we just need to seek god first and everything else will follow so if i want to be healthier really instead of focusing so much on being healthy i need to focus on seeking god and he will give me all the fruits of the spirit that i need to get healthy like self-control and discipline that's going to come from god and my therapist just reminded me of that is i need to seek god first and everything else will be added they also showed me just the importance of being content at the end of my day and just not having any regret just acknowledging what i did get done that day and not thinking about my day and being unsatisfied because that is not what god wants they also sent me four scriptures for me to focus on after our session and this is why i love faithful counseling so much it's just so amazing to be able to talk to someone and then they follow up with more scriptures to read so these are the four they sent hebrews 6 10 romans 8 38 to 39 philippians 4 13 and 2nd corinthians 12 9 through 10. on top of this they also sent me some other worksheets that are more like cognitive behavior models and those actually really helped with me and kyle which is unrelated to this video but we needed a little bit of help in our communication and we ended up meeting with my therapist both at the same time and they were able to give me and kyle some more insight on how to just communicate with each other better and that was really helpful as well so they do do couples counseling i do think they offer premarital counseling too if that's something you're looking for but i will have my link in the description if you guys are interested i'm pretty sure my link is still active to get you 10 off i'm pretty sure so i would highly recommend faithful counseling that will be in the description and i just wanted to share some more mental aspects of my fitness journey because you guys always seem to enjoy just me talking about mentally just my fitness journey and not just physically so okay i hope you enjoyed this video i just wanted to give a general overview of my experience there overall i really loved the workouts when i was there they were only 45 minutes to leave time for sanitizing and for me that was the perfect amount of time the workouts were challenging over the course of the two weeks i definitely saw an improvement in my cardio i could run longer and in my strength i could lift heavier weights i also saw some changes in my body as my waist i think i lost maybe a half an inch or maybe an inch in my waist overall just more definition in my body the only con i would say is the music the music they play there um they do beep out the swear words but it is very aggressive and derogatory music so the only thing i would say that was the only downfall that i see i wish you the music was more clean i'm tempted to bring in my own air pods and listen to like worship music or something just better than what they have going on because i do believe what we listen to really can have an impact on our overall mindset so that would be the only con i have overall i really do love the workouts and i plan to continue going to orange theory the next couple months before my wedding when it opens back up anyway i hope you guys enjoyed this video i'm sorry that it wasn't more in depth with like before and afters but like i said i only got to do it for two weeks so there wasn't gonna be a huge transition for me personally it was just really nice to get out of the house and have a scheduled time now that i've been probably two weeks off i have not been working out at all and i think that's a huge part it's just hard for me to motivate myself at home right now and obviously we go through different phases in life but right now i'm just in a stage where i really just want a gym to go to anyway i hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you again to purple she for sponsoring i will leave all the links in the description to their activewear i absolutely love everything they sent me and i highly recommend them so thank you again i love you guys thank you for watching bye what's up it's cayenne with her new eyebrows um if you guys don't follow me on instagram you're probably like you look crazy i got my eyebrows microbladed and um they get pretty dark after they get microbladed but then they scab off and peel so they'll look a lot lighter by next week sometime but for now i kind of just look a little evil i'm not used to having my eyebrows like this prominent and dark but anyway welcome to today's video we are starting a moving series um oh no a creep a creep in the background oh oh i was going to tackle you but i don't want to knock this over what's up y'all i'm doing some moving vlogs you thought i left already i thought you were trying to wait to start this video and so i left the house no it just so happened that you were on your way out i got some people to school kyle's gonna go play football with some guys gotta wreck him put him in the dirt carl hasn't exercised in months or played sports in months maybe longer yeah years but the only like ex-asu football players yeah it's no big deal put them in the dirt baby i love your confidence you have fun you guys all have fun together have a great day i know they're my friends yeah they are this is who i get to hang out with we found our apartment which i also announced on instagram so if you're not following on instagram you probably should i honestly wasn't planning to move until september like early september however this place offered a one month free and in order to get the specific unit we wanted we literally had to apply that day because someone else was gonna get it so we ended up applying that day and we set up the move-in date for this weekend so basically i get to move in really early so i'm starting to pack all of my stuff and just get ready to move and i thought i would do a little moving vlog all my hanging clothes what i do is i put them in like a trash bag i made kyle go through his clothes with me because that boy still has stuff from eighth grade and i've been trying to get him to get rid of it because it's literally from eighth grade and he promised me when we start moving we can get rid of some of his stuff and let me tell you he put me through the ringer yesterday and was giving me such a hard time but we got rid of he allowed me to get rid of ten um clothing items and ten knick knacks we haven't gone through the knickknacks yet but anyway that bag will be going to goodwill then i store started doing a pile of things i'm gonna sell so i have all this stuff it's all gonna be on depop so i'll leave it my link in the description let's do it   okay made my quesadilla i will tell you guys the ingredients to this special sauce i love to put on my quesadillas because it tastes like the taco bell quesadilla sauce it's a mayonnaise i'm using a vegan mayo so it doesn't taste as good but mayonnaise paprika i put chalua hot sauce but you can do a different hot sauce if you want and then today i added a little bit of garlic powder um but yeah literally just dip this quesadilla in it adds a lot of flavor just scarf down that quesadilla now let's get in to the haul i'll start with some of the house stuff so i found these coffee well i don't even know if they're coffee mugs i found these glass mugs and i thought these would be really nice for iced coffee i don't have much dishware i think i have like four i have four of these like plate bowls and a few mugs so i've been trying to go to the thrift store and find like dish sets and stuff just so i'll have it in the home so i can cook and stuff like that when we move in instead of like buying brand new stuff so anyway with that being said i found these cute little um mugs i got two of them they're a little bit different this one was 99 cents and this one was a dollar fifty this cool cup here this one was 150 as well i have been dying to get like a huge wine glass i love red wine so i saw this and had to get it it was a dollar fifty the next thing i got was this little like ceramic pourer i feel like this would be used for like creamer or gravy or something i don't know this one was 99 cents then i found these bowls and i just thought they were really unique i love how big they are they're like really big and deep and these were only 350 for the set and these are like really heavy duty then i found these little ramekins these are i mean i love sauce so i really bought these to put like dipping sauce in when i eat like i love hot sauce so i would just throw my hot sauce in here or whatever sauce i'm using um these were a dollar fifty each i feel like they should have been 99 cents but anyway got two of these figured these would come in handy then i found this mug and if you saw my thrift haul on my instagram you will know i actually got a very similar mug but i think it's new mexico and i found this one and it's hawaii and i love hawaii the last like kitchen related item were these spoons and there are these like i think they're real brass um the front two are really good condition but the back two you can see they're like super faded but this set was 250 and i definitely talked myself into getting these because i definitely don't need these but i thought these spoons would be really nice for just like stirring coffee every time i do a thrift haul i think about kyle and that he's gonna watch this and be like what the heck am i marrying and every time he does he's like that's exactly what i'm thinking is like what is she buying um so i found this cool like amber vase it's pretty tiny but i thought like maybe putting like the pompous grass in here or um just using it for decoration i found two there's three of these but i bought two of them they're 99 cents so super cheap i also found this little pretty vase very tiny again and this was a dollar fifty but it was half off yellow tags were half off if you work at goodwill can you please tell me i have been dying to know do you guys go and take off all of the tags of the color that's going to be on sale the next day because i swear whenever it's a yellow day i can never find any yellow tags but there's a million pink tags and then when it's a pink tag day i can never find any pink tags so can you tell me if you've worked at goodwill please i need the truth i'm not gonna report you but i need to know do you guys i don't know is that scamming us not really but do you guys play us like that because that's so rude and i will not hold it against you personally i know it would just be your you know protocol so i'm not going to come at you personally but for my like piece of soul thing i would love to know i think many people need to know and i think we need to expose goodwill anyway some wedding stuff i got were these candle holders um i found out i can have exposed candles so i i really love these brass ones i think these would be pretty in our house as well apartment but this one was 150 and this one was 350. and on the topic of candles i found a jackpot i found all these little white candles i really like the height of these because when you have a candlestick this tall if you put like a really big candle then it becomes like super tall but i just think this is a really lovely height for candles so that's perfect i even was like that no that does not look good okay take it back anyway this whole set i don't know how many are in here i'm assuming about 10 was 3.50 and the last thing i bought that was just miscellaneous was this visor they had three of them so i'm assuming i don't know they just like didn't sell somewhere and they donated them but this was only 250 and this is like a very trendy thing i think it's cute really cute this is basically what they sell like this is trendy right now and they sell these suckers for like at least twelve dollars yeah so got this cute visor and that concludes my goodwill haul i have been packing up the bathroom and also just gave the plants a little bath um i really have nothing else to say just that i wanted to show you guys some proof that i'm doing something it is a couple days later we have got the keys this is the situation right now today we rented a truck so i could get all my furniture from the other house and we have a big truck downstairs so we're gonna unload that and then i'll probably start organizing everything yesterday i didn't get a lot done but i did here's the bath or the bedroom right now just kind of a mess we had to go to a wedding yesterday so but the closet um is unpacked a little bit so i started doing the closet i just color coordinated everything i'm still gonna like work on these shelves gotta figure that out um we have some kyle's winter clothes that he doesn't wear right now oh here's the update here is the update just got stuff everywhere oh okay we're going to home goods i'm very excited we're gonna pick up some essentials we need like cooking tools and like trash can organizational stuff are you excited for it let me put on my excited face i love home goods so i really need you to not kill my mojo okay hey i love you so we're gonna have fun i love home goods perfect i think this is upside down i love home depot so i'm glad to go there next okay sounds good bye i'd say we had a successful shopping did you enjoy your home goods experience i actually did it was quite fun oh now we're gonna walk over to marshalls just did some damage so i'm gonna show you guys what we got okay i have a huge haul i'm not gonna read off the prices because this would take forever so i'm just gonna go through everything really fast got a can opener super exciting we got some just like washcloths for the kitchen i found these which were pretty cool they're just like hot plates i think that's what they're called they're called trivets an oven mitt just you know the basics then um i wanted to try these reusable storage bags so we got a big size and a sandwich size and i just thought these would be nice instead of having to buy a ton of like ziploc bag we really love this it's a little avocado holder then i got a big pot this one has like a built-in steamer so i really like this this was 30. one of the most expensive things we bought today i really like the fridge to look very organized so i literally buy an egg holder so i don't have to use the cartons i got this this is really cheap it's only six dollars but basically you can just put it in your pantry and it expands and i like to put either like spices on here um or like canned goods so you can see them all and it just looks nice and organized and we got this knife set we're hoping these work uh we're hoping someone buys us like a nice knife set from our registry um for our wedding so hopefully these will hold us over until then and i got this little lid organizer but you can also use it for like baking sheets and i hate the sound of like going through pans it's just so loud so i thought this would be really nice i could just put our lids and baking sheets in one of our cabinets then i got a bunch of other fridge organization stuff just got these got a nice baking sheet i got this like bamboo wood silverware organizer i made sure to measure the drawers before we went um just so i can make sure this fit and this will fit perfectly we got this spoon holder and it says home as for me and my house we will serve the lord joshua 24-15 we couldn't unfortunately find any silverware sets that we liked at home goods so we ended up going to target as well and we just bought this like basic silverware 20-piece set and this was and then we also couldn't find any plates they just didn't have any good place at home goods that we liked so we just got these basic ones from target to hold us over as well bathroom stuff i just got this hand towel we got this little scrubber for the dishes a loofah on a stick i really like this it's a bath mat it's actually from the brand ugg but it's like super thick it's double-sided so this will be perfect to get out of the shower also got a shower caddy we got a broom and it has like this attached dustpan and kyle was a really big fan of that he was very stoked about this room we're not doing any drum rolls in this um i found this candle give me the pot yeah go cook for us isn't that a sick broom and then we got this candle then i just got a set of these hangers kyle really wanted a laundry basket yeah i did um so we got this one and i've never seen this before but it literally is collapsible like look how thin it is so then you can just easily store it i mean that's such a good idea i've never seen this but this is just shout out to these are awesome so we got one of these we got this is like the only really like decorative thing so this is just like a lot of basic stuff i'll probably get decorations like way down the line but we got this wine holder it's so cute um this was 20 so honestly not that bad i feel like they probably would have priced this at like 30 or 25 last but not least we ended up spending a lot of time on this we got this trash can and i don't know if you guys can tell from the video but it's like a really like muted pink color and i really love it i was looking on amazon for trash cans and all they really have are like silver ones for like seventy dollars this one was forty dollars but it has a small dent in it so they marked it down to thirty six well first off the dent was a lot bigger before i got oh you blocked it yeah i popped it out oh nice i mean in all humbleness i say and then the pedal was also broken yeah so the pedal this part was broken and it still kind of is broken um so we just have to be like really gentle yeah i don't know it's not an open brain right now yeah just gonna be gentle yet firm yeah so we got a trash can we also got this trash can for the bathroom again all they have is silver but i found this like a matte gray one so this will be great for the bathroom hide the goodies as in like how many houses girl things uh anyways anyway kyle's going to cook us dinner and i think i'll just end the vlog here because it's probably so long already so thank you guys so much for watching definitely subscribe if you want to see more apartment things if you guys have any ideas or cute things send them my way i would love to check them out any like decoration inspo and stuff all right love you so much   bye hello everyone welcome back to my channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne and i make lifestyle faith related and i don't know i'm trying to sell myself but it's not going so well so i'm just gonna stop hello hi today i'm going to do a reacting to assumptions video and probably a little life update as well i needed a video to break up all of my moving content because just moved into this apartment and it has been taking up all my time i swear it feels like a full-time job and that is such a blessing that i can dedicate so much time to getting this place all decorated and ready it's been so much fun but with that being said that's all i've been filming so i wanted to kind of do a sit-down kind of just light-hearted video to break up all the moving content or else you guys would be seeing straight moving vlogs for like two weeks so let's just get right into the assumptions i asked you guys on instagram to make some assumptions about me i've kind of peeked through a little but a lot of these will kind of just be straight off me reading them if you guys aren't following me on instagram i'll have it linked below okay the first assumption is that you want to be married so badly because you want to finally have sex with your boyfriend if you guys didn't know me and kyle are waiting till marriage and it's actually so funny because i honestly forget about sex like i just don't think about it very much and i full-heartedly believe that is a blessing from god because it does not consume my thoughts the only time it does is if like we're like making out or something which like i said in our boundaries video we hardly ever do that anymore but that's the only time i personally really think about sex is if we were having like we were just like kissing a lot but yeah we don't really make out so i honestly don't think about sex much at all the next assumption is you have strong discernment about situations yeah i think so i think i have been blessed with discernment and really being able to see situations for what they are and a lot of that's because of the holy spirit giving me that discernment so i would say yes yes that assumption is correct you're a very caring person and you make sure everyone else is taken care of first that is a very nice assumption but i will say that is wrong listen i can be especially uh i think i would lean more towards a selfish person like i want to make sure i'm taken care of first i'm naturally more of a selfish person but through jesus he's helped me be more caring towards others i think that's the best way i can explain it but my natural i like to be selfish like my flesh definitely likes to be selfish and when i'm not spending time with jesus i get way more selfish being in this relationship also acts as a mirror and shows me how selfish i can be too because kyle is very caring and i think kyle likes to put me first he definitely does so i've just realized how selfish i can be someone assumed that you don't like answering instagram instagram messages this is true um that sounds bad but it is true i like i probably have 300 at least unread messages and i'm someone who like i'm definitely like i avoid things and because i know i can't respond to those 300 messages right now i just keep putting it off and putting it off and then it just becomes so heavy and heavy and heavy that i never end up doing it so there will be times where i'll go through a couple messages but yeah i'm really bad at it i really just need to get better at just dedicating like 30 minutes every day to going through my inbox but it's very overwhelming but when i do it i do love to respond so it's not like i don't want to respond to you i think it's it's really just like a personal problem that i need to work through because this is a pattern in my life that i just avoid things and then it gets so heavy that i never do it so it's not you it's me because i would hate to think you guys think i don't like you or like talking to you i love responding to you i just have an issue someone assumes you don't want to have kids right away i think that assumption is pretty true um i've gotten to this point where i'm like pretty pretty set on just letting god send me a child whenever he wants to um so i just don't think i'm gonna try to control it obviously i would love to enjoy my marriage with kyle alone for a few years before children but if god wants me and kyle to have a child right after we're married then i'm at peace about it but if i could selfishly choose yeah i would definitely want probably a solid two years of marriage before a baby someone assumes you wish you'd become a christian sooner yeah definitely i mean life is just so much better with jesus so obviously i would have loved to become a christian sooner but god brought me through all of my non-jesus days for a reason and i think a big reason is that i got to share a lot of my experiences with you guys someone assumes you will have a fall wedding yes our wedding is in october someone assumed you wish you would have been single for longer um yes i mean i love kyle and god's timing is perfect but i actually i don't think i've announced this on youtube yet but i told you guys on instagram so if you guys have been here for a while you know i was planning to move somewhere and i was keeping it a secret well i'm just going to tell you guys i was planning to move to australia i was planning to move there of in may of 2020 so i would have been there already um but it's funny because the pandemic shut down the borders so if i were to have moved to australia i wouldn't have been able to go but anyway i had that's the whole reason why i moved to illinois i moved back to my i moved back in with my parents so i could move to australia i wanted to take my single diaries journey to a whole nother level i wanted to live in another country i wanted to know nobody and i just wanted to take on this adventure with myself and god and honestly it like being single was some of the best times of my life i me and kyle both reflect on our singleness and we're like dang just loving jesus it it's easier when you're single so um it makes sense that when i was single i had so much joy because i just dedicated so much more time to my relationship with god and now being in a relationship it's definitely a just an adjustment and just a new type of relationship with god that i'm like navigating through i guess if that makes sense i thought that would have been pretty cool if i could have gotten to move to australia and done single diaries moving to another country with jesus but no god presented me my husband before that and obviously i wouldn't change a thing and i'm so grateful for kyle and now being married but let me tell you ladies enjoy your singleness it is so much fun someone assumed i had braces when i was younger i got braces when i was a senior in high school i'll insert some photos now i had actually very straight teeth i just had one front tooth that was slightly crooked and actually when i was in cheer a guy made a comment about it and then since that moment i wanted braces to get it fixed so man people's comments can make you insecure i had braces my senior year of high school and the first semester when i was a freshman in college and i kicked myself so bad for getting braces i don't know what i was thinking i thought they were going to come off before college but i was really insecure my first semester of college because i had braces even now i look back i was like you can't even tell it's really not that big of a deal someone assumes you're not organized this is i have become an organized person however i am a messy person i think there's a difference there are organized people and then there's messy people i am messy but i am organized like i like you know i like my spices all looking the same in a certain position i like my drawers to be organized i like everything to have a spot but then i'm like messy and just like throw things around and i don't really mind being messy you know but let me tell you if you asked my parents they would say i was so messy and unorganized this has been a growing process in high school and middle school my whole entire bedroom floor was covered in stuff it would probably take me like five hours to clean like i would only clean like once a month maybe someone assumed kyle gets on your nerves sometimes when he's in a goofy mood um okay i have realized that this is true but only when i'm trying to get something done like when we're trying to get something done and he's just being like really goofy i get annoyed because i'm trying to get something done but he knows that it annoys me and he thinks it's hilarious so he does it on purpose someone assumed you want to have three plus kids yeah i would say two to three two to four really just depends on the genders i guess someone assumed that you're the friend everyone has deep combos with that's true i love a good deep combo i'm really good at asking people questions to deepen a conversation so that's one thing kyle really liked about on the cruise ship he said i asked very good questions and if you've seen my other videos i literally used to google questions to ask people and that's probably why i'm good at asking questions because i practiced and researched someone as soon as you've had nightmares about your wedding day yes i've had a handful at least five nightmares but i'm blessed because i am just thankful that they're not like every night i maybe have one every week or one every other week so it's not so super intense right now so praise praise god for that someone assumed you like playing with kids yes i like playing with kids i actually have fond memories like look i think like two years ago or last year i literally will get in the jungle gym and go play with a child or sometimes i'll just go in the jungle gym alone and go down the slide i think it's really important to practice being a child as you're an adult and with that being said i think i'm in a really serious mindset right now because i have not been very childlike lately which is not very like me i've been really serious lately but you know we all go through phases i think this is my reminder to make an effort to be more childlike because yeah i used to literally just be a kid i just loved to play life would be better if people were running around playing tag as adults you know like we would play ghosts in the graveyard you know like we could have like a fun laser tag night together you know what i'm saying life would be more fun someone assumed that i was a prostitute and i would say no if you saw my testimony i was on like a sugar daddy site and um at the time i had like i mean i think it sounds a lot worse than it is i mean it is kind of bad it's really yeah should we get into it i don't really know maybe i'll do a whole like video where you guys can ask me questions about my testimony and then we can talk about it more because i honestly haven't i feel like my testimony like my whole past doesn't exist anymore i think that's just the power of jesus like i forget about all those things and no one honestly asked me about it so maybe i'll just do a whole q a about my testimony that would be fun let me know if you guys want that i mean i don't know if it'd be fun but it'd be interesting someone assumed that you make a lot of money i guess it depends what you consider a lot i don't think i make a lot of money last month actually was my best income month ever but i think prior to like last month was pretty high but prior to last month i would say my income was about average um to someone who has a salary job so i'm obviously praying that it increases because i would love for social media to be like in youtube to be my full-time income and i would also love that to be my family's full-time income so kyle doesn't have to um work doing like the instacart and doordash i would love for him to be a part of youtube and make this our full-time income but yeah i'm not there yet so someone assumes you are not a very rigid or uptight kind of person no i'm pretty laid back unless i'm unless i'm in a bad mood i would say i'm like pretty chill so your fiance is going on your nerves so funny i kind of answered that someone assumed you struggle with depression p.s i love you thank you i love you too i do not struggle with depression i think the only time i would have considered myself depressed was in high school because i was on birth control and it really messed up with my emotions i was honestly crazy like crazy and i was depressed um but that was solely because my hormones were so out of whack from birth control but that was really the only time i would have considered myself depressed someone assumed you have so much self-control thinking about how you and kyle live together i could not yes it's so interesting because it's yes and no so when it comes to boundaries and like not having sex and all that stuff me and kyle are very both like we are both very self-controlled in that i do not know why we are so good at that but yeah it's such a blessing we do not get tempted and i i don't i literally don't i think it's really because you guys pray for us but i don't know we're just we don't get tempted and we do not struggle with temptation and we are both really good at self-control when it comes to that but then on the other hand i am not self-controlled when it comes to other things like when it comes to um eating sometimes i can act really impulsively and i feel completely out of control like i've talked about in videos with like binge eating i used to um binge spend money um so that i was not in control of and thank god that he rescued me from that habit because i literally used to binge spend money like i would emotionally spend money um or i would like go shopping and then from the high of shopping i would like keep shopping and buying things that i couldn't afford and things i didn't need it was a whole it was a whole thing but that is another thing god actually set me free from someone assumed i'm the youngest sibling i am actually the middle child someone assumed you aren't a gossiper and you hate gossip that is true i try to think of it this way if this person was in the room would i still be saying this stuff like would they be hurt by what i'm saying and if the answer is yes i do not talk about them or say those things i think you should go straight to that person obviously i'm not perfect so i'm sure there are times where i do say things that i shouldn't have said um about someone when they're not around but i definitely do not like gossip oh people are assuming i'm five seven and five six i am five three i'm short someone assume that i'm that i'm very clingy in a sweet way you guys are even so nice in your assumptions i am not very clingy but that's because his love language is quality time so he just loves spending time together and obviously i love to do things with him but yeah i would say i'm not very clingy i'm very much independent i like my alone time you don't drink at all anymore the only thing i really drink is wine i can't even finish one glass of red wine these days like um i can't even finish one but yeah usually i'll have one glass of wine or like a half a glass of wine just because i love the taste of red wine so someone assumed you prefer secular music over christian music no it's really hard for me to listen to music that's not christian aside from country music i can get down with country music but if i turn anything else on i'm like nope see ya someone assumed in high school you never partied and you just stayed at home studying no in high school and in college i don't i don't study i never studied i'm not a studier i took a lot of online classes for a reason if you know what i'm saying because i was age i never studied i hate studying studying i was a good test taker so i didn't really have to study to get like a b uh b's and a's i would literally just take the test but yeah i never studied really for anything and i definitely partied in high school uh i probably parted the most in college let's be serious like at asu there's parties like five times a week so i probably partied the most in college but i definitely partied when i was in high school as well but high school it's more spread out because it's like your pa you know you have to wait for your friends parents to go out of town before you could do anything so maybe we would have like a party once a month or something like that nothing crazy someone assumed i never swear yes i love you i love you too um yeah i don't swear i try my best not to i'm trying to think i've been really good i haven't let anything slip in a long time assume you have never doubted your relationship with kyle i would say that's true the closest thing i got to doubting it was actually when we first started dating and it's not like i doubted kyle but it kind of goes back to like i wish i was single for longer when me and kyle first started dating like right when i got home from the cruise i was like whoa whoa uh i'm single like i make videos about being single like i think i had somewhat of an identity in being single and i loved being single so then going into a relationship i don't think i was quite ready to let that go that was something i kind of was struggling with and it's so funny because i went back through a journal entry and i was like writing this was like years ago i wrote down something like i was like talking about a guy i had met and i was like this sounds so messed up but all i can think about is if i were to make a youtube video with this guy like it would not be good or something like that like i really wanted whoever i was gonna date i wanted them to be good for youtube which sounds so horrible he said i don't know why this is i don't know if this is because i just think i won't be able to be successful on youtube unless i have a boyfriend and couples sell better and all this stuff and honestly like god has god has brought me through that that was a long time ago but it was so funny because i went back and looked at that journal entry and then just reflecting on how now i don't want to be in a relationship and god just freaking mocked me and he said well remember couples sell and i was like dang god you got me you got me so yeah god was teasing me in that way and then from that moment i was like fine you win okay the last assumption is that i am controlling and i would say this assumption is correct but not in the way like most people think controlling like kyle i'm not controlling over what kyle does like he can do whatever the flippity flop he wants to do but i am controlling with like how i want things to look i think i would more say i'm very particular like i i know what i want i know what i like and it's very hard for me to compromise when it's things like it's silly stuff like how the apartment looks and just stuff like that you know like i wouldn't say i control kyle at all i just think i'm very particular and selective um so sometimes i feel like that can be a little controlling because i i want to have control of i kind of like just want to be the decision maker um when it comes to a lot of things which is something i'm working on because as a wife i'm just i need to work on being more submissive and letting kyle lead but i am blessed because kyle is very easy going so he is very okay with me making a lot of decisions when it comes to like the decorations we buy or what furniture uh i want obviously he has an opinion in it but he he kind of is like yeah i know you're particular you like things to work look a certain way like you can decide on that but yeah i don't think i like control what kyle does at all you know what i'm saying all right guys i hope you enjoyed this video i hope it helped you get to know me a little bit more i had so much fun doing it let me know in the comments what you guys want me to be filming obviously there's going to be a ton of moving stuff my bachelorette party is coming up at the end of august so that's going to be really exciting and then i am assuming september is the month before my wedding so i'm assuming it's going to be a little hectic so i'll do my best to upload what i can but appreciate all your grace over the next couple months oh and one last thing i did want to say is i know i would love to be making more faith related videos and i know a lot of you guys would like me to be making those videos but here's the thing my relationship with god comes first and during this season of life uh my life is shifting so much that i am trying to navigate my relationship with god and build it up on this new foundation instead of like i really built a great foundation with god and my relationship with god when i was single so now i'm really going through a transition phase of building my relationship with god now that i am engaged soon to be married and that is just a growing season and i think that's an important thing to remember especially for anyone who is a christian youtuber there are just going to be times in our lives where our relationships with people and with god need to be in private instead of in public and i'm sure that'll happen with me and kyle there might be times in the future where our relationship needs to grow privately and be kept private instead of public you know and i think that's just where i am at with god like i need to grow my relationship with god privately before i try to come on here and pour out into you guys because honestly i'm just trying to receive right now because your girl is going through transitions and i just hope that makes sense i think i think that's a good way of explaining it my relationship with god we are growing it together he said like we don't need anybody's eyes on us we're gonna sit in this box together and chat so that's what i'm doing i'm sitting in a box with god and we're chatting and i can't wait to share in the future when he says all right this was a great conversation now you may leave the box and tell everybody what i told you in the box but for now we are just in the box that just took a turn anyway i love you guys if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up be sure to subscribe to the channel and in the comments let me know which of my answers surprised you the most alright love you guys bye good morning welcome to another moving vlog uh we just got the internet set up so that is a major win it's been like three days of us trying to get it set up it's finally set up so that's amazing we just got some amazon packages so i'll show you what we got here we have a beautiful toaster let me see the front yeah i ordered this really cute retro looking toaster i love the neutral color it's it's similar to the look of the smeg ones but the smeg ones are 200 but this one was 40 i think so not bad i'll have it linked in the description this is the brand it came like overnight shipping and then oh yay what is this my spice jars oh geez i ordered these for all the spices and i think i'm gonna get some etsy labels oh it actually comes with yeah i don't like those i like the ones that are already uh it's already got the labels on it i know i just don't like the look of it men don't understand here is the update we just still have a little bit of stuff here i'd have to go through these boxes today um but everything else is pretty cleared up i put all my decor stuff on this because they don't have a home yet i want to hang up this mirror i'm thinking about putting my desk here for now until we get like the living room furniture and can like better format but look how cute the wine rack is it looks so cute and then the trash can looks absolutely perfect if you guys follow me on instagram you know i found this at goodwill and i wasn't sure if it would work without the top but it does so that's gonna be on display there also found this paper towel holder i actually ordered one on amazon it was 16 and then i went to home goods and found this one for six dollars i set up some candles over there this morning we tried this coffee well it's more like milk and it will hold the blue so we wanted to try this one we've tried some of the other stuff and like it but this one literally just tastes like too much like oatmeal coffee in it yeah it's not it's not very good the regular black coffee i wanted to take you through all of the stuff i got from home goods last night i set a lot of it up um so it's gonna be a little home goods haul no no drum roll it's a perfect opportunity i got a ton of organizational bins just like this they had a pack of four of these so i got that we got some of these white neutral sponges i got this tray to just put all this stuff in and then i want to get a little soap dispenser to fill with that so it's not so much branding got this cutting board oh i'll update you on the fridge i use some of those organization containers and look how nice the eggs look if you saw the last video we got this hamper found or actually kyle found this one it's a little teep thing but i think i'm just gonna take the cap off and use it to hold all of our like kitchen utensils it's a good size um i found this little waistband waistband it was only 13 which i honestly expected it to be more like 20 but i thought this would be cute to have by my desk we got this big wood cutting board we got this toilet cleaner i like it because looks nice keeps it hidden at target we found this plunger then i got some more organizational things so i got this big one and i measured the drawers and this one was like a perfect fit also got these two i found this one and i decided to just do like my makeup and stuff here um it's not like the best because it doesn't really fit but i don't really mind it being kind of like tilted up i'd like to hang up this mirror i asked you guys on instagram what i should put over this desk a lot of you said the mirror and then also to put this palm frond like around the mirror or above or below it so i'd like to get that all set up today now i'm making a to-do list because honestly my head is kind of all over the place my top priority things to get done today is i have to film an instagram story for blooms it's these flowers um they make faux flowers so i need to do some instagram stories for them which means i need to get ready and also try on one of my bridesmaids dresses i also need to take a picture for all in favor in their pants so i need to do that later today more towards sunset also need to make a landing page for a client and i need to pick up some mail ship a depop order set up water like delivery services and probably a lot of other stuff that i haven't written down yet so i'm gonna keep working on this list okay i'm gonna get ready however i think i'm gonna replace the light bulbs in the bathroom right now this is kind of what they look like so they are pretty yellow i mean it's not too bad but i do have some light bulbs here that are daylight which makes them really bright and white so i'm going to change them out and see if it's too intense so let's see so you can already tell the difference like this one definitely has more cool undertones but i'm not sure if it will be like too intense if i replace them all okay so i'm missing a light bulb the last one i have is like significantly bigger than these ones so i must have i mean this is a four pack so we must have used the other one and i have no idea where it is so i think i'm just gonna leave like this for now until i can get that but i definitely like it a lot better um i don't know if you can tell from now to the last clip but the lighting is just more cool and i prefer that especially because i'll be doing my makeup in here and i just want the colors to look as true as possible i just finished filming the instagram stories i gave them a sneak peek of my bridesmaid dress so if you're not following me on instagram you definitely should and i also had them vote on which flowers they like the best i'm doing something exciting i am ordering my wedding band and actually me and kyle decided to just do like something cheaper we didn't want to spend a ton of money on our wedding bands so i found one on etsy actually and i'm going to show it to you i personally love it we did go to the store to try on some with my ring to get a better idea of what i liked and i honestly did not like any of the stuff they had in the store so i looked at some of the review photos and some people had similar rings to mine so i got a feel for what it would look like and i think it is so beautiful so let me show you this is it i think it is so dainty and beautiful it's only 280 dollars which is not bad compared to some other um rings and it is made out of gold and real diamonds so it's 14 karat gold and what really sold me were these photos this is kind of what it would look like with my ring that's what it looks like so i absolutely love the way that looks this girl's setup is so beautiful i think that looks really really pretty as well i wasn't sure my exact ring size so i dug through kyle's papers and i'm pretty sure i'm a four and a half and i i found this little chart online to help me as well and i am pretty confident i'm in four and a half because this is a five and mine is smaller so i am good to order that i am so oh i sent it to the wrong address   i'm hoping because i literally just submitted it that they will change it otherwise i'm like oh my gosh i'm so screwed up oh wait okay okay it's getting shipped to my family's place so that makes me feel better so if anything it'll be shipped to them but i'm hoping they will change the shipping to this new apartment for a second i thought it was my old old address that like no one lives at anymore so i would have been so upset but i'm pretty sure they'll be able to change it because it just went through so my next package came in my utensil set i wanted a neutral color i was thinking white but then kyle said the white will probably stain and it's silicone tops wooden handles also comes with like measuring cups so many um but now we are going to fedex because i need to return those borrowed bloom flowers and then who knows where life is going to take us i need to go pick up my friend for bible study i think i have about like an hour and a half maybe two hours before i have to go get her so yeah i don't know what's gonna happen okay i just dropped off the fedex packages now i'm in line for chick-fil-a i don't know if you guys know this but i didn't eat meat for i think four years um and then recently i've been dabbling with some meat and just kind of seeing how it makes my body feel i had chick-fil-a for the first time since i don't know probably five or six years ago um earlier this week and this is my third time getting it i am obsessed with chick-fil-a now i am craving it so hard so i think i just need to get it out of my system and then there is an at-home store which is like a huge furniture store and like decor and just a huge home store i guess so i'm gonna walk around there i do still need a desk chair we still need bar stools   currently hanging some things and deciding what should go up here we tried many different options only one word the consensus was the mirror difficult this is not how you place cups that is how you spill cups this is how you place a cup put it on the table i don't realize i'm doing it this has been a reoccurring thing i've noticed like four times the last 24 hours cups literally hanging on the edge i'm gonna knock them over it's just gonna happen oh does anyone else do that i had no idea but then he started pointing it out and literally every single time he's like i just put it right on the edge i don't like the table you're like you know what i'm gonna see what happens by putting this halfway off i did anyway now kyle's gonna hang up the curtains okay so the other day i went to goodwill and found a lot of goodies so i thought i would do a little goodwill haul the first two things i got were these lamps i saw a tutorial on instagram and basically you can paint things to look like they're kind of ceramics so i saw these lamps and i wanted some matching ones for like the bedside tables and i thought these were a good size and i was like you know what i feel like i could paint these and make them look kind of like ceramics i still need to find some kind of um shade to put on these that looks well looks well with it but i'll put some pictures now for the inspiration behind these lamps i picked up some paint which i'll show you these lamps were three dollars each i got some vases i think i'm gonna keep this one this color or i don't know i might paint it we'll see but i also bought some glass ones to paint so all of these vases were like 50 cents to a dollar so i just went to lowe's and found some nice neutral colors this is the other one i'll show you the shades so this brand is valspar i got this one it's called sahara sands also by vospar is terracotta trail the last one i got is from sherman williams and this one is called peach mason so those are the three colors i got to paint this stuff the next thing i found was this other lamp i thought this would be good for like the living room space and it is this wooden lamp i don't love the silver but i'm just like want to paint everything now so i'm going to try to paint this base like one of those neutral colors and then i saw on pinterest these lamp shades so i thought i would try to find something like that just something really like funky and cool to really add to this lamp this one was 550 i also had a coupon code if you sign up for the email address you get 20 off coupons for the each month so basically everything i'm showing you right now was 20 off as well the next thing i got was this picture frame i thought it was pretty i could keep it this wood color but i might paint it as well um and then i think i can just find a print off of like etsy or something to put in here i found this pot it's super cute and speckled the next thing i got were these soup bowls and they had two of them they're 99 cents each they are this like emerald green color inside but i used it last night for my soup and it was really cute i just also thought they'd look really nice in my cabinets then i found just this wooden bowl i actually have some essential oils coming in so i thought this would be a nice place to store essential oils and just have them on display then i found a lot of cool glass cups this one is my favorite one it's a super like wide chunky glass mug so love this one i think that was 99 cents then i found this cool glass one it's like super heavy duty at the bottom then i found a cool tall glass cup as well and then the next thing i found was this bowl it's a really pretty neutral color and then it has these designs on it here's my setup put down some trader joe bags and i'm gonna throw on like a youtube video and just paint hello all of these are pretty much done i love the colors i'm like not sure if these are a little too pink they actually look more muted on the camera like on the camera they look really nice but in person they kind of look peachy now i'm working on this um right now i just really don't think the color looks good but i'm pretty sure this color will darken to that so i'm just gonna let it dry and see how it looks okay some other updates that i forgot to mention is i found a chair for my desk this is what she looks like she's really beautiful i found this one at home goods this one was a hundred thirty dollars which is a little steep for a chair not gonna lie but yeah the other one i was gonna get was 120 so i was like at this rate i might as well get this beautiful raton one i did end up getting some pillows to go on it so both of these are from home goods this one was super squishy so this one's perfect for the bottom because it flattens out like that and then this one's more supportive that's what she looks like with the pillows on it these are so good i ate this whole bag it's down to here i ate all of these in the last 24 hours this flavor is awesome i love buffalo i actually just made some mac and cheese and put buffalo sauce in it we got our water dispenser delivered today i am so excited for this and you might be asking cayenne why are you excited for a water dispenser well this has k-cup oops wait just kidding this oh no i don't need your day okay just anyway this has cake capabilities so i can just put in my k-cups here and i can also get my hot water and cold water i need to fill up my water bottle right now this one is from amazon it's super cute i love the silicone on it because then it doesn't sweat i'm an adult i'm excited about a water dispenser i am such an idol another idea i had was for kyle to build some floating shelves like the really like thick ones that you see i thought it would be really cool to have like two right there on that wall and then i could put some like decor and artwork and maybe like throw this hanging plant on there to kind of trail off i just think this corner would be really cute with some shelves i showed you on instagram i just got a bunch of new highlighters these are the ones i use for my bible they are the tombow art you can see those and they have really great like pastel colors just got some new ones of those i also got a new hard drive i've just had the most terrible time with hard drives but this one i got a warranty on so if it breaks or anything in the next year i think i can get it replaced and all of my hard drives don't last my last hard drive lasted two months and then i sent it in to get repaired and then it came back and it was still broken and it's like i paid 130 for this thing so i'm hoping this one works better i really like the cable that it comes with better but yeah now i'm going to just sit and   edit ello everyone welcome back to my channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne and i am so excited to be making today's video in my assumptions video i asked if you guys wanted me to do a q a kind of all about my testimony if you haven't seen my testimony i'll have it linked below basically i posted my testimony i think almost two years ago and that was honestly one of my first videos that took off that video actually has the most views out of any video on my channel and a lot of you guys found me from my testimony video so i just wanted to answer some questions and kind of open up more about my testimony since it has been so long since i kind of revisited it i don't think i've actually watched it in so long i i think i the last time i watched it was probably soon after i posted it so i got oh my goodness i am stumbling over my words today holy spirit fill me with self-control and clarity jesus say actually god i just ask that you use this video for your will just invite you in to take over and answer all these questions for me from your perspective for your children in jesus name amen i asked you guys over on instagram to send me some questions about my testimony if you're not following me it is at cayenne tilton and i'll have it linked in the description so let's just get into your questions protoblue asks i recently posted my own testimony how do you handle the backlash and negative so my testimony has mostly positive comments but i think that video also attracted a lot of random people and a lot of people who maybe don't know jesus and a lot of people left negative comments on that video um some people just calling me really bad names and just condemning me so and also what happened after i posted that video a lot of people went to my other videos and then just started judging all of my other videos and what else i was posting and judging me for posting certain clothing hauls and they just went to all my other videos and started commenting on things trying to condemn me and convict me of things so girl i feel you i have had my fair share of backlash and negative comments what i first tried to do was defend myself and i got very defensive hi i'm in the middle of filming a video can i call you after okay shout out katura so as far as comments there are three ways i approach it and this was a learning process over time the first way is if it is very hateful and just rude i tend to just delete them or ignore them and just don't put any energy into it the second way if the comment is you know rude but they're asserting their opinion or constructive criticism i will leave it and either one not respond to it if if it's going to emotionally take a lot out of me to respond to it then i just leave it alone because who says we're required to respond to everybody or not however if i really feel my spirit that they need an answer i will respond either and say hey thank you for your opinion i respect your opinion i love you jesus loves you like have a great day um that that comment can usually take people back or i will just briefly explain where i'm coming from and my perspective on something if i feel that it's important that i'm understood i guess and the third way i look at negative comments is i recently listened to a podcast with sadie robertson and um uh lauren day daigle and she said the best advice she had ever been given was somebody told her that give people permission to misunderstand you and i just love that you know we do not need to be understood by everybody we do not need to be so defensive like god is our defender and i think in my early youtube career i just was so defensive and wanted i just thought we all needed to agree you don't want to agree we really don't everything i say you are not going to agree with and that's okay because we are different people and i think that's just something we all need to realize is you are never going to find anyone in the world that you agree with everything on and just because you disagree on something it doesn't mean you can't be friends or friendly towards them or love them regardless so those are kind of how i deal with the negative amber nicole payne asked did you feel guilt shame guilt slash shame about sex after becoming a christian or did you instantly feel forgiven i instantly felt forgiven for sure i didn't not have any guilt or shame yeah i was just like god is giving me this gift of forgiveness like thank you jesus i accept full-heartedly and yeah who wouldn't want to accept that free gift so oh someone asked does anyone in your family go to church with your dad now i teared up when you said he goes alone oh that's so sweet i teared up too yeah so actually my mom got saved three years ago now so she and my dad go to church every week and she's on fire for the lord um also my older sister started going to church and you know i'm praying for the rest of my family as well but yeah he has some companions um i'm just glad that my mom goes with him every week taupe fwb asked how did you share your testimony with your family so i kind of you know really the first time i shared my testimony was in that video i think throughout time i didn't really realize that was my testimony until after i filmed that um but i will tell you how i shared you know the whole sugar daddy thing with my family that was actually during this like personal development course that i had taken it was like a three day or four day course or something like that and during that course they asked that we would call our families and you go through this process and like call a family or a loved one or somebody close to you that you need to you know share something with and through that uh i and through god obviously he gave me the courage to call my mom and dad and i called both of them i talked to them separately kind of shared what had happened and at that time um you know i wasn't recklessly pursuing god but that was the point where i shared everything and over time i like was able to kind of piece all those things together to share my testimony as a whole but yeah that's how i shared with my parents and god definitely gave me the strength obviously it is not the most comfortable thing to call up your parents and let them know uh about your sexual encounters and all that stuff but yeah god definitely gave me the strength and both my parents were very understanding and it and loving and forgiving and it opened up conversation especially with my mom to just get more deeper of a relationship formed with her fruity melly asked do people ever bring up your past to justify their sinning no honestly i think people are still like they acknowledge my testimony or they have watched it but they never talk to me about it i honestly i don't know if they're just uncomfortable to bring it up but i'm sure a lot of people have seen my testimony and know my testimony but don't ask me any questions about it don't even bring it up um and i think that's probably because people are uncomfortable so that's another reason why i wanted to make this video because i am really shocked that i don't get more questions about my testimony but i think also people are trying to be respected of my privacy and things like that which i appreciate sincerely stronger asked not quite a question for this topic but how did you deal with soul ties honestly that is very related to my testimony because obviously for my testimony you guys know i had sexual encounters with two men um i don't think i got into specifics but yeah it was two men uh and honestly those encounters were i mean my past encounters with men were mostly like boyfriends or flings i think there was a lot more evil and spiritual warfare and i think these men were very tormented by the devil which what is what caused them all these insecurities and these evil thoughts is what caused them to pursue women on that website so those specific experiences were definitely more traumatizing when it came to like sex in my past but anyways how i deal dealt with them i think i really was able to completely deal with them after i met kyle because i knew i needed to put more focus on those soul ties and one of my friends erica actually would meet with me we would do face times and we would just go through repentance um and asking god to remove me from them and them from me just break off these spiritual ties it would be repentance forgiveness and removal um and then just gratitude and thankfulness and receiving what god just did so that's kind of the process we went through on our facetime calls and we would just go through um each situation and i would go through and repent for anything that i did during those um situations that were sin and you know obviously it's not just sex um there was sin in like receiving money for that there was sin in um just my thoughts towards it there was sin and being like greedy there was just sin and not trusting god there was so much sin involved in those circumstances so i went back repented for everything that i could think of so we would spend like an hour probably at least doing this and i would just go through everything just repent repent repent and then also just forgiving them and asking god to heal them and ask like just praying over all the spiritual warfare and the demons that were tormenting them and causing them to have these these kinds of thoughts that were just messed up so yeah that's kind of the process and honestly ever since we did that and just prayed over it i feel just really completely healed from that kate tobin asked were you anxious uploading a video so personal yes i was definitely anxious about it i was putting off making that video for probably at least a month there was a solid month where i knew god was calling me to make that video but i just kept putting it off and i was really scared and anxious and i think i shared this in my testimony that i just would bawl my eyes out every time i heard the song reckless love and every time i heard it i just knew god was calling me to share my testimony video but yeah it was definitely scary and hard and i was very nervous to share it star flower dreams ask when and how did you realize the healing that came with being a born-again virgin honestly i realized this through my thoughts and through my behavior my last boyfriend who i dated two years ago if we did anything sexual which it wasn't frequent because i started having that desire to save myself but when we did i would feel so convicted i would bawl my eyes out afterwards i would repent i would pray so that's kind of when i started seeing a change in my heart after that relationship i fully committed to saving myself for marriage and not doing anything sexual with men until i was married after that happened i started to realize that my thoughts and my behaviors were healed and like i didn't think about sex anymore i didn't think about men in that way i didn't want to do those things my thoughts became more innocent and pure and that was the healing that i saw um from becoming a born-again virgin i think all of that definitely ex escalated all of that healing definitely escalated after i was baptized so highly recommend highly actually it's not a recommendation i strongly urge you to go get baptized especially if you are dealing with sexual sin and feeling shame and guilt and not feeling like you're truly a born again virgin i would highly encourage you to go get baptized again that was really something where i totally felt that all of that was washed away selena marie perez asked what do you think was the most damaging thing you were doing before you had christ uh definitely sexual sin in the bible it says sexual sin is the one sin where you're sinning against your own body so like i've said in many videos i believe all sin is equal and not to be compared one to the other but the one sin that you are harming yourself especially is sexual sin so i think that was the most damaging thing i was doing before christ sun soaked media asks are you ever afraid of being exposed for your past since you put yourself online no because i exposed myself and since i got to control my narrative of the story um and how i wanted to wanted it to be told and represented um yeah yeah and there's just no fear for those who live in christ because god is my ultimate defender and he is the only one i should fear fear the lord you know she also asked how do you stop from feeling shame about your past i think the most important thing is to forgive yourself and also repent for everything you did i think that is the first step in receiving that forgiveness is to genuinely repent and turn away from what you were doing and then receive and truly believe that jesus died on the cross for everything you did and he did not die for you to feel shame another thing i would do is go youtube jesus crucifixion and watch the crucifixion scene from what's the movie called i'm blanking on the movie but go watch that scene and i think after you watch that you will realize like god i am being so stupid right now for letting this shame overcome me you literally had your son go through that once you really see what jesus did for us i mean it's just so silly of us to indulge in that shame and own that shame jesus literally was murdered and beat and suffered so much for us to be set free from that so i just encourage you to really get to know who jesus is and what he did for you because if you do there's just the only way you would feel shame is if the enemy is attacking you so that's some spiritual warfare right there and cast that out in the name of jesus because we have power and authority over the devil because of jesus so yeah pray pray pray protect yourself in prayer cast the enemy out cast all of his lies out and tell him to get the heckity heck out of your mind and your life and all shame be gone in the name of jesus and i just pray over you right now that all shame would be gone in the name of jesus that it would leave right now that the enemy has no authority over your brain over your thoughts over your life enemy i just cast you out of anybody who's watching this god i just cast them out in the name of jesus that they would be set free all chains that the enemy has on them god i just pray you would break them in the name of jesus that they would be set free from all shame and all guilt amen kenzie garza asked how was it sharing with kyle you weren't a virgin p.s so thankful for your videos i think i knew he wasn't one so i guess that made me more comfortable with it but yeah we were actually chilling in the hot tub on the cruise ship um and sharing each other's testimonies i shared mine and honestly when you share your testimony online for hundreds of thousands of people to watch i guess telling someone isn't that scary but i think it's truly because i knew i was forgiven and that there is no shame or condemnation for those who are in christ jesus that you know i'm gonna share this with him and if he responds negatively or does not forgive me or see me for the new creation i am then he's not my husband and that is okay god bless him pray for him and yeah i mean there literally is nothing to fear if you truly believe god has someone out there for you then that person will accept you and see you through god's eyes and forgive you through god's eyes and give you that grace through god's eyes and if they don't then they're not meant to be your husband and you should not spend any time worrying about it all at all it's actually so funny on the cruise ship um i had this other guy message me about my testimony this guy had met him i met him on facebook um and he was a believer loves jesus but he was waiting till marriage and he was a virgin and he had seen my testimony and i hadn't gotten to share that with him yet but he saw it online and he was just very just rude about it he just texted me something very rude and judgmental about my testimony and you know honestly i just stood up for myself and i told him i don't know what i told him i'd have to go look back on the messages should we let's do it okay so this is what he texts me how how's all your video stuff been i saw some the testimony one broke my heart a little not sure if i fully understand and don't mean to be insensitive but was sleeping with a bunch of sugar daddies at one point question mark and i'm like dude you're assuming and i feel like that is a little insensitive anyway and i said i'd agree that you don't fully understand and the assumption is pretty insensitive i appreciate you opening up the conversation my testimony is something i prefer to talk about in person it wasn't a bunch of people there was just one i slept with he was a year older than me but regardless of the details i don't think it makes a difference god forgives us all our sins regardless of a number that's why he is so good he sent me this wednesday december 11th and that was i'm pretty sure while i was on the cruise and i was talking to kyle and it was so cool to see his response um to my testimony versus kyle's and yeah just such a blessing it did not hurt me at all i was just like i am forgiven regardless of the details so peace out you are clearly not meant to be my husband no sir haley asks did your friends judge you when you decide to become a devout christian maybe a few of my friends uh at the time but my two like closest and best friends did not they supported me and saw the positive change that i had in my life both of them actually would come to church with me we would go um they would come to the young adults stuff occasionally and yeah they were supportive and very loving liv turner asked before kyle did you find it difficult telling christian men that you had had sex already judgment etc no it wasn't i guess i kind of went into it not knowing a lot of virgins so i kind of assumed most christian men had already had sex but that's probably a wrong assumption because i do know there are a lot of men who are waiting for marriage now but i kind of figured that a lot of people were born again but anyway yeah they're just there is no shame economy condemnation for those who are in jesus so i just cannot say that enough get to know jesus until you literally believe that with every bone and fiber in your body if you do not believe it you need to dig in and get to know jesus more because that is why he died and it's so important that we do not miss that alexandra asked did you have sexual relations with your sugar daddies have you since talked to them ever since um so there was only two guys that i had actually physically did anything with one was just a year older than me so i think a lot of times you assume that they're a lot older have ever talked to them since actually one of them reached out and actually wanted to apologize for everything that happened i never ended up responding to him but i think that's really cool maybe god's doing something in his life or maybe he was just trying to open up the conversation to get involved again i'm not sure forever summer eden asked did you immediately start getting convicted by the holy spirit when you got saved that's a great question um it happened slowly i think some conviction started um faster than others i would say slowly after going to church and learning more about jesus those convictions started it was definitely not for me a overnight thing where i was saved and then all of a sudden i like wanted to live this holy life that's not how it happened i know that can happen for some people but yeah for me that wasn't the case um these questions have been so amazing thank you to everyone who asked me them maybe i will do another q a all about this but for now i'm going to wrap the video up here i love you guys so much i'm going to leave a few bible verses in the description because i just think there have been so many questions about shame and guilt so i just want to encourage you to go down and look those up in your bible and really meditate on those and pray over them so you can truly feel the freedom that christ is offering us and has promised us so i love you all very much i hope you have a blessed week and i will see you in my next video good morning i am really excited because last night we got a lot of good stuff for the apartment where you can actually see a difference so i'm going to show you we went to ikea and home goods so the first thing we actually put together last night we got these bedside tables from ikea also we got these little lamp shades for the lamps that i diy'd i think they look really really nice my young living order came in and i got the aria if you guys have ever seen these on instagram they are like the most beautiful diffusers ever so i'm really excited to have that if you want more information on it i will leave in the description i think it's sold out right now but if you're into oils or been wanting to buy oils highly suggest young living like i was saying i have multiple friends who do it and they always give me oils for gifts or let me trust them out or sometimes i'll like ask them to order something for me so i finally took the leap of faith and leap of faith i finally pulled the trigger and ordered my own oils for myself because i do really like to use them especially now that we have a place i want to be using more natural stuff so yeah we ordered the aria premium kit premium premium kit and then i also got the ningxia premium kit because i love the ningxia it's like these antioxidant drinks and i love mixing them with like bubbly probably make one later today but anyway that's not what this is about um okay the next thing we got is a headboard this was like a last minute decision um so we'll open this up so you guys can see it later but i ended up getting a headboard it's kind of like a raton one so hopefully we'll get that up today um i've got all my oil stuff got this one from home goods i thought it was just like really nice and minimal um to put maybe in the living room i'm thinking about actually hanging up my shelf right here i put this cutie over here i think i'm gonna like repot her and then we're just gonna leave her alone because we just need her to get comfy also got this little basket from ikea for one of my plants very exciting then i got this one for one of the plants as well because i had originally bought this guy but honestly this looks so much better and it's about the same price so i got that then we got these little canisters i've been thinking about putting like our milk and juice and stuff in these so the fridge looks really nice and minimal then you got this big basket all this stuff is from ikea this is really nice it's 30 oh i haven't even i haven't even told you guys that we ordered a couch as you can see we kind of laid it out to see i think we're gonna actually move it back to this edge but yeah we got a couch i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure kyle is pooping right now and sending a voice message praying for somebody he's in the bathroom but i literally hear him like sending a voice message praying so whoever is receiving that voice message just now he was pooping when he sent it anyway we ordered a couch um from living spaces i was like scouring the internet to try to find a couch and obviously i would have loved to do something similar to the cloud couch because it's it's just super cozy and white and minimal however obviously i'm not going to get the cloud couch it's over ten thousand dollars and then the closest dupes were still pretty expensive like this living spaces utopia couch was one that i was looking at but that was um gonna be over two thousand dollars so we didn't want to spend that much money so we kind of just kept looking around i even thought about like diying a cloud couch and just kind of doing a makeshift i was also considering the ikea i don't know what it's called but i'll have a picture of it here i was considering this one um and then swapping out the cushions for ones that are more fluffy because the ones it comes with are really hard so i was really trying to figure out a way to kind of mimic that look on a budget i really thought honestly doing that couch with different cushions would be a really good idea because it has the same shape and like the deep cushions it just they're not comfortable we went and sat on it and they're very not comfortable but if you were to like stuff those with like different filling or just i was thinking of honestly hiring like a local um seamstress and having her just sew us new cushions to put on there and then like making them super fluffy i thought that would be a really good idea however the couch isn't even stock so oh well we ended up going to living spaces we found this couch um what is the name of it i don't know i'll have it linked below so this is the couch we ended up getting it is a light gray color i would have preferred a white however they didn't have it in white it only comes in light gray and dark gray but i still think it is like a nice it's i don't know if it's a little warmer gray but i still think it's a nice color and will match with everything here so we don't know when it's going to come the delivery window is between two and five weeks so i'm hoping for the shorter end because honestly it just feels like we're in one big room without the couch to like divide up the space another thing i got from home goods are this just like stackable bowl plate set the bowl set so it just comes with six bowls and six lids i think that's really great because it's really easy to store them and i like that has lids on it so if we make something i can just easily put them away for leftovers but then i can also use these for mixing baking whatever so i got that goodwill the other day i got this new banana holder it is perfect it looks much better than the other one this was only 250 so yeah so i found these jugs at jugs that's a weird word for these i found these canisters for the pantry at goodwill and look how cute they have these bamboo tops and like a little leather strap these were a dollar fifty each so i found two of those i also got this planter from home goods this one was thirty dollars i bought it because i wanted to transfer this one however i think honestly this one might be bigger this one's definitely deeper so i was considering maybe moving it but i could also i know this one's gonna grow bigger so maybe in the future i could move this one into it so i need to find a place to put this guy but that looks cute i also found this basket at goodwill and i'm just using it as like the recycling bin and then i also found i didn't mention it this basket to put in our shoes which we're not very good at as you can see just so they have kind of like a home kyle is still going in on his prayer then we got a card some cards for things that are coming up got some chip clips last but not least i got this planter as well basically i was looking for options to put this thing in so i'm going to either put it in this one or i'm going to put in that wicker basket okay this is what the headboard looks like is really beautiful and honestly this is way more affordable than any other similar one this one is only a hundred dollars at ikea the other rattan kind of boho headboards that i've seen have been like at least 400 to 500 and up okay okay to make sure that white parts behind it so that would probably be like the highest we could go okay what's up i have no idea where this is gonna be in the video but i wanted to give you guys kind of like a wedding update i honestly have not been doing a ton of stuff for the wedding we are about two months out so it's gonna get closer my bachelorette party is at the end of this month um the plan is just to go to coronado most of coronado is still open you just have to wear a mask and sit outside at the restaurant so we got an airbnb right outside of coronado and that's where i'm having my bachelorette party right now i'm talking to mallory who is the calligrapher who is going to be doing all of our signs and our place cards i will have a link to her website in the description all of her um profits go to support her mission trips which i think is an amazing thing so if any of you brides are looking for somebody to do calligraphy i would highly recommend her so i was talking to her and i really want to do a place card similar to this that has kind of that terra cotta look to it however we just couldn't find anything that looks like that for a decent price especially with place cards if you're gonna have a hundred of them you don't want them to be like a few dollars each so i randomly just came up with the idea i don't know why i didn't think of it sooner if you guys follow me on instagram you would have seen my recent diy crafts i've been just like painting everything that i buy from goodwill and it kind of has like this textured look basically all you need to do to achieve it is add baking powder to the paint so i just picked up a terracotta color and i've been adding baking powder and just kind of giving it this chalky texture and i was like wait we could easily do this with tiles or coasters or just pieces of wood so now i'm on floor and decor their website and i'm seeing these tiles you can get a 4x4 tile that's just plain and white for eight cents or you can get like a like a subway tile if you want more of a rectangle look for 15 cents a piece so if we got 100 of these it's only 15 versus before we were looking at things that were like just ridiculous so this is what i'm considering however i thought it would be cool to use them as a coaster so i'm actually thinking instead square ones these are eight cents a piece and they're just like plain squares four by four so i'm thinking we'll paint it in a similar style to this and then she can um write their names on top of that and then i was thinking of just getting these little coaster sticker pads and then putting it on the bottom of the coasters um so they're more functional the next thing i kind of was looking into was napkins and table runners i really do want these kinds of table runners that are kind of like the cheese cloth gauze look so i was thinking about ordering those off of like etsy or something however it does start adding up those will probably be around 300 at least so i was considering trying to diy those and just buying some gauze and like dyeing it myself and just seeing if that would be more cost effective or if it would just be a better idea to order them however now i'm thinking about diying my napkins as well because all the napkins that the caterer the caterer has shown me so far are just like really cheap and just not the best colors so i was like you know what maybe i can diy the napkins if you guys saw on my instagram i thrifted this mirror yesterday and it is this beautiful wicker mirror however someone spray painted it like a light pink and i started putting um nail polish remover on it and i revealed that it is this beautiful natural wood so we went to the store yesterday and picked up some acetone so that's what i'm going to use and i'm just going to go in on this mirror and try to get it cleaned up i just got back from a bunch of errands i went and met with my wedding planner i am actually using one of my good friends brittany she owns a business called bridal stitch so i'll have her instagram linked below if you are an arizona bride she is amazing and i would highly recommend her i am so grateful um that we have the means to pay for a wedding coordinator i think honestly i don't i can't even imagine having a wedding without a coordinator and you would just have to stress about so many more things or have one of your family members stress about it so the fact that she's going to be there we're just doing day of coordination but we meet several times beforehand just to make sure everything's set and i feel so confident and she's just the sweetest person and she loves jesus so major bonus there so we had a meeting and then right next to the coffee shop was cb2 and pottery barn so i kind of went around and shopped i have never been into cb2 but honestly cb2 is goals that is literally what i want my place to look like however it is also gold like you need money to shop there i found a couple plates so i'll show you those i got these light pink ceramic plates these weren't too bad they were about ten dollars each they're pretty dirty right now so i need to wash them but i got two of those i thought they were super unique would be really beautiful for any kind of photos and we needed a couple more plates and then i went to pottery barn kind of went in at pottery barn so i got the thing about pillows is that they sell them the inserts separately than the covers and honestly these down inserts weren't very too pricey they range these ones i think were 18 each and then the other ones i got were 20 each it's really the covers that they charge an arm and a leg for but i wanted to get some really cozy soft pillows fluffy pillows for the couch i also ordered two more pillows that were not in stock but they were so soft um this is what they look like or maybe later in this vlog they will be in she said it takes about three to five days for them to arrive so we'll see if they end up making it but they'll be here right after the couch gets here so that's perfect then i also got this really chunky blanket i'll insert a photo now it's gonna look so cozy on the couch i just really want the couch to be somewhere that you just want to take a nap on and like lay on all day so i got that chunky blanket definitely more of like splurge home decor items however i do like to invest in some stuff a lot of my decor has been thrifted or from home goods so definitely more on the affordable side so i did want to splurge on a couple of items so really excited i also got news that our couch is going to be delivered friday which is in two days they said it was gonna be three to five weeks um and then it ended up coming literally i think we put in our order last week sometimes so less than about a week i would say it took so i'm really excited for the couch to get here it's going to make such a difference in making the the whole place seem more homey and the last little update right now is kyle i don't i think i mentioned that kyle went to get the bar stools so he went and got those so those will be here later today so i'm excited to see what they look like in person and also work on kind of revamping them a little bit here is the current status of the chairs that's pretty gross stain we're a little confused because there's like it looks like there's blood is splattered on it but it's kind of like all over the chairs why they sold them so cheap is because they killed somebody pulled the covers off put these dirty covers on to like make it seem like everything's fine but they didn't clean the chairs so now we have evidence of a murder so we're going to probably try to buy new cushion and let's see if we get rid of these well i'm going to take it with me so i know the size and then trying to get new fabric to reupholster thanks let's get it this thing's not even on oh   perfect   so i ended up getting some of the foam it ended up that stuff is like 35 a yard thankfully they were 40 off plus the girl told me to get the 20 off coupon that can be used on top of sales so i got um 80 inches of the foam and then i found that material that's 25 a yard but that was also 50 off so or with the coupon i used the 20 off coupon i ended up spending about 68 um it was originally gonna be about 120 so saved a lot of money by using that coupon and it helped that everything was on sale now i'm just walking to home goods because kyle is getting lunch for dinner with a friend he's asking him to be his groomsman so i am just entertaining myself by going to home goods which i cannot complain okay i wanted to give you an update on the chair situation we finished these two and i'm in the middle of reupholstering the other two cushions needed to take a break i personally i don't know how i feel about it i guess it doesn't look that bad i just think they're really tall and they kind of like block off the space right now they're not pushed against the table obviously i just think they are kind of an eyesore i'm trying to convince kyle to like cut off this because imagine if like the backs just came to here and then i put some cane webbing in it i feel like it would make it a lot more like modern and cool this is the fabric i picked i think it actually turned out really nicely unfortunately i had to cut all of the cushion foam myself so it's really hard so the edges are pretty jagged at some places i honestly wish i just ordered some like pre-cut cushion foam it would have been so much easier but you know here we are it is finished so anyway that's what i'm working on right now and then i'm going to go film a video for which you guys probably would have already seen let me show you the mirror so i bought a stain from for the mirror to kind of try to even everything out this is the one i got and it's in natural which i really think just means clear because it did not make any difference the only thing is is it's like super shiny now which probably helped a little bit but honestly the difference is not much but i might just leave it like this for now unless i want to go buy another stain which i don't so we're just going to leave her alone i thought i would give you a closer look on what i'm doing so i tried out this new method where i do the corners last so i just pull it as tightly as i can staple it around the sides and now i'm gonna go in and do the corners i found that this has worked pretty well to keep them nice and then i literally just play around with this it's hard with one hand but i just keep playing around and pulling it and trying to find like the way to fold it that doesn't have like creases showing so obviously i can't do this with one hand and then at the end i'll go around and trim off all the excess fabric so i'm gonna play around with this corner and yeah then we'll only have one left   wow hello everyone welcome back to my channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne i make lifestyle videos recently moved into a new apartment so tons of moving vlogs right now also i am getting married in a month so there will be wedding planning stuff and wedding videos and all that stuff coming up on my channel but today is going to be another moving vlog there has been a lot of exciting changes in the apartment that you will see it later in this vlog so i hope you guys enjoy love you i am so excited to be working with greensteal on this part of the video they actually offered to send me a couple things for the apartment so i browse through their products you can buy them on amazon and i found the most amazing chair to put on the patio so the first thing we got is this really big chair holder i'll show you a better view in a second but we wanted to get this because we didn't want to have to install any like bolts and stuff since we're just renting however you can hang the chair from like the ceiling if you would prefer that look for us we needed to make it more apartment friendly so it's this really nice matte black platform it is really tall let's see it's taller than me i think it's also taller than kyle but i'm gonna have kyle hang the chair let me show you what it looks like it's kind of hard to tell right now but this is it it's a macrame chair it has a really unique design that's kind of what it's going to look like hey kyle can you hang this for us please uh how big is your budget i'm willing to pay the big bucks kyle says he's gonna be able to curl me if i sit in this chair oh my god oh my god i don't know if this is a good idea yeah this is a really great stroke to my confidence all right let's get it to install it we actually aren't using any of the chains we're just connecting it directly to our stand because we need it hanging a bit higher gotta see the view yes those mountains for sunrise okay it is so cute it's definitely a really unique design and it's super spacious i like it because you don't feel enclosed because these um what are these called like these hoops i guess the support around it keeps it open whereas if you were in like a different hammock you know how they kind of close on you so i think i would style it with some pillows make it super cozy like that all right let's try it out oh yeah that's a move wow okay this is super nice i can't wait to use it like in the morning when it cools off in arizona be like drinking my coffee doing morning devotionals out here it's a hundred percent cotton and it's also anti-corrosion so it should work well in like the seasons even though arizona doesn't really have any seasons but yeah i'm super excited to use this if you guys are interested i will have the links in the description i think it's so cute you look good in it babe thank you   oh my gosh it's liquor already yeah it is what do you i think it looks really good yeah doesn't it yeah i think we could even when we install it a little higher too what a view what have you the most beautiful view i feel like there's a weird thing to be doing on camera probably i wonder if you actually use this in the video maybe maybe what did you tell them how much i love you you're such a little love ball when it comes when you turn this thing on so i'm not when it's not on you are sometimes you're just extra sweet yeah can you tell them that we've returned the other one no i didn't you want to tell the people what happened yeah so i showed you earlier the other um headboard that we got and honestly probably right now it looks very similar but it's it's different i showed you guys loading it's definitely different it's going to go a little higher but basically we found this other one on offer up and it was only 25 so we reached out to this lady but it was a full instead of queen and then she said she had this other one which was a queen and then she was gonna send us pictures and she ended up sending us a picture of this one and i just ended up liking it better than the ikea one so we decided to go get this one but then we had to take back and return the ikea headboard yeah but yeah right now they look very similar but i promise well this one is legs and it's also like you can see through it yeah next project adding some height to this headboard we're going to try this method of using these picture hanging systems these support 75 pounds and we got two of them one for each side   the headboard is officially installed look how beautiful it looks i love this little bottom part that sticks out i think it adds a lot but i mean the pillows will probably cover it all but at least this way the headboard will show a little bit even with the pillows there okay lots of progress decorating yes we have what have we done we set up this corner nice got some baskets home got this picture frame up though and god said let there be light got this bad boy home and then in here we got the shelf up grass thingy up palm tree branch thinking about putting a chair in that corner what corner this corner yes put chair comfy cozy chair in here buddy   i know that we'll be free   my pottery barn order came in i have been very excited for this oh look how beautiful so i got this huge chunky blanket and then also some pillows and pillow inserts for the couch so let's get these styled and see how they look okay i'm pretty sure the last time we talked was the pottery barn order came in and then i never showed you the couch so let me show you what it looks like i don't even think we have shared this couch yet so we ordered this couch from livingspaces i really wanted a white couch but all the white ones i found were just not in our price range or in stock so we found this one it's like a light gray so it still works with like warmer tones and it is very big we love how big the chase is um you can fit like two people over here these are the two pillows and then that chunky blanket really is a statement i really like it on here and yeah this is what our living room looks like so far next project is hanging this mirror i have decided to follow jesus exactly no turning back no turning back so we're gonna hang it right here i think that'll look good my other option was in this corner but with this mirror on this wall it's too much but a couple exciting things came in the mail i ordered this blender it's basically a dupe for the magic bullet it's only 27 so it has good reviews everyone says it's interchangeable with magic bullet stuff so also my aura order came in i got the vegan chocolate protein and then they also sent a free sample of their turmeric powder you can use it to make like two mark lattes and then i ordered some long iphone chargers just because you don't have a lot of cables we're running out and the ones we do have are super short so it's not ideal for being on your phone like if you're in bed or something so a pack of three of these is only ten dollars so i'll have these linked in the description as well and then the last thing that came was my wedding band which kyle put away already this is the packaging i ordered it off etsy i'll have it linked in the description it's actually a pretty good price as far as wedding bands go and it is super dainty super dainty tiny diamonds and it looks so good if you have like a plain gold band like this it looks so good i'll try it on really quick that is what it looks like so pretty i need to clean my ring but i love it so much he was so excited i wish i could wear it now but i will wait be patient kyle also hung the mirror it looks so beautiful when i was staining the mirror i got i think i got a lot of the stain it like splattered all over the mirror so there was probably like a thousand tiny dots and kyle was taking them off for at least an hour he did an amazing job because now you cannot even see him but yeah they were splattered everywhere i think it turned out really nice     i just got back from last chance and also the tile store so if you guys have never heard of last chance which you probably haven't because there's only two in the world one is in arizona it's in phoenix arizona and the other one is in lombard illinois and actually last chance is where all of the nordstrom returns go so think of a giant thrift store full of nordstrom returns and basically name brands like a luxury thrift store they also do tag days so today purple tags were 80 off which is insane i only found one purple tag i think you have to get there really early it was a saturday too i completely forgot not the best day to go it was super crowded as you guys can see from the clips but anyway i ended up finding a lot of good things the first thing i got was this jumpsuit really cute just has these tie straps this was 11.97 and the brand i like to check the brands just to see if i know them this one's called honeydew i've never heard of that before then i found this free people movement workout top and this was only 6.97 that's what it looks like has a nice slit the next thing i found was this body suit this is a reformation brand so it is super comfy and these cost a lot of money but i was able to score this for 9.97 then the last like clothing thing i got were these spanx i don't really know how much spanx go for these days but these were eight dollars then i saw a lot of home stuff there so i got these really soft towels these were on sale for 4.97 each they're the nordstrom brand i also found this washcloth for a dollar 97. all of these are really nice quality and things like this are not used then i found this sham this is a linen one and these things cost like i don't know a set of two linen shams cost fifty dollars so this was only six dollars so for linen that is a really good price and then there's a nice like beige color on the other side i also found this decorative pillow i really like this one i thought it was really cute but simple and this was 4.97 then i got another sham this is what it looks like really neutral has some stripes on it but i thought it would be nice to have some extra pillowcases because i only have these white ones and i honestly drool a lot so it'd be nice to have some to change out also got this little card case this was the only purple tag i found you basically just stick it to the back of your phone case and then these like pop open so you can stick your cards in you can also use it to hold up your phone i'm pretty sure and this was half off so it was originally 3.97 i got it for it was 80 off i got it for 79 cents then the last thing i got were these pillows these are the brand pillow guy i've never heard of them but i was going through all their pillows and just like feeling them this was the closest one i could find that had a similar feeling to a down pillow if you guys don't know down pillows cost like a hundred dollars i don't think this is a down pillow um all pillows were on sale so it says 1897 however i got them both for i think they were on sale for 12.97 anyway for a pillow like this that has like i mean if you know you know the texture i don't think these are down but they're very similar so the fact that i was able to get those so cheap i really have been wanting to replace mine because mine are really flat now so i'm excited for that all right guys i hope you enjoyed the video what's going on i don't know you can do it i have so much faith in you baby thanks alright guys i hope you enjoyed the video it was quite a time we just had together let me know in the comments your favorite thing that i showed you throughout these hauls and decorating scenes and i just hope you all have a great day and subscribe to the channel goodbye i don't even get a laugh come on just silence wow this just got awkward this is awkward i hope someone's laughing on the other side of this hi guys hello welcome to today's video i think i wear this shirt in like every vlog and every video but that's just i like it a lot okay if i look very tan it's because i just put some fake tanner on i'm trying out a new brand so maybe you'll see them in a future video but today is sunday and i decided to do a little vlog with kyle we're gonna do a date night i've been filming a lot of like moving stuff and sit down videos but i wanted to do more of like a lifestyle and i think it's also important for me and kyle to keep up our date nights we would like to do at least one a week but we haven't been very good about it getting the apartment ready and everything ready for the wedding i think you can get lost in that and forget to continue to like really date each other so we're going on a date night kyle planned a dinner i think i don't know where we're going so that'll be a surprise which is really fun i'm just getting ready right now i'm about to do my hair and makeup so i thought i would show you how i do my hair so i just start with my natural hair this is kind of like the texture of my hair after i shower and then throw it in like a braid i'll have some waves in it and then i just take this barrel curling iron nothing special this is from the brand duvol and i believe it's one and a half inch this is like a very quick so i kind of wrap it around and then i just move it up and down really depends on your hair and how fast it curls my hair is very thick and curls very well so yeah i just do wrap around and then i leave the end out and that makes it easier that way i don't have to curl all my pieces i can leave some of the ends straight okay i got to my top layer all the rest is curled however this top layer is pretty funky from my like ponytails so i'm going to give myself a little blowout just using what is this the revlon like air whatever um highly recommend this really cheap well like i think it's like 40 and i love to use this it's so much easier than trying to like blow dry my hair okay before i do my makeup i wanted to quickly show you the package sparkle sent me and like i said i'm going to try these on with some outfits and then kyle's going to decide my outfit tonight so that'll be really fun so what sparkle is is they definitely specialize in apple watch bands however they do have bands for the fitbit and the samsung watches as well they also have other accessories like sunglasses cases wallets keychains and some other fun stuff too so definitely check out their website even if you're not in the market for a apple watch band specifically what's really cool is they do upcycled designer bands they also have just genuine leather bands as well if you're not in to more of the designer look so they take old bags that would be heading towards landfills and they turn it in to little bands how beautiful is this one the reason why they started this company was actually their founder courtney was going on a date and she didn't like the look of her apple watch so she actually tried it on with i think a bracelet and that's kind of how the idea got started and i'm in complete support of that because honestly this on a date night i do not think looks good so i'm really excited to try these bands on with some of my date night outfits and just see how much better it looks than having like a sport band on this is great for working out but i definitely need something a little nicer for the date okay so this is the second one they sent me this is a louis vuitton one and i'll have all the ones mentioned linked in the descriptions this one is probably my favorite i just love these classic monogram so that one is really beautiful and the packaging of these is really cute as well they do drop new products every day so definitely keep up on their website if you're interested in any of these this one is a really beautiful classy snakeskin print and the last one they sent me which i think is my second favorite is honestly just like this very neutral leather band okay this is my first outfit it's kind of hard to see but it's this really pretty off the shoulder dress and has all these ruffles and these pretty flowers i paired it with the leather band so that's what it looks like i think it actually matches really nicely so let's see what kyle thinks of the first one kyle want to come in this is the first outfit is that new i've never worn it before i've never seen you wear that yeah i bought it for our honeymoon it's beautiful thank you all right okay friends and then this is the sparkle band it doesn't match nicely really dresses up matches with the outfit that's cool i like that what would you rate this scale one to ten or would i rate it yeah the shoes are nice too um i would say don't pick two more i'll give you this eight and eight okay an eight this is an eight all right yeah i'll give you the knee for sure that's nice i like that and here's an up close this is the next outfit it is this really pretty red dress and has this cool detail across the top and i paired it with this wristband i thought it matched very well something about red that looks good on you really like me and red i love you in red wow yeah you look so beautiful yeah i love this um nine a nine yeah okay yeah nine do you like this thank this you cool isn't it pretty dude i got to give you one of these things these are sick yeah all right look at that dress you like it okay so this is the front runner yeah this is the front runner for sure bang okay another one one more one more yep and then we'll head out for our date kind of run out of time yeah we are okay all right this is the last outfit it is this really cute ruffled romper and i paired it with this one there's a little brown spots in the romper so i thought this brown one looked amazing with it i really think this might be my favorite you know how you're always filming me yeah well now i'm filming you oh and i have a beautiful frozen baby all right wow girl baby i'm blessed all right watching you speak come up and review the last one this is the watch i paired it with because the brown oh i like that that looks

you want me to wear the red dress don't you i love the red dress now i love this too this is beautiful mm-hmm i mean you could wear this tonight for sure it's nice but we have to pick the winner do we have to pick the winner well you yeah you design the plan yeah is that the goal is that the objective at all yeah you're picking the outfit but everyone gets the most highest rating okay for sure all right well the red one wins all right you heard it here so we're gonna go leave her our date night yeah we got about like uh half a freckle to go so we'll take you with you thank you again to sparkle for sponsoring this video gold sparkle pokemon i will you don't interrupt my sponsorship i will leave links to everything in the description and my discount code will be in the description as well so definitely check it out i am absolutely obsessed with all of these and i'm so excited to wear it on our date all right we're going to be late let's go my lady kyle always opens the door for me oh look at my messy car but i came on here to say that men should open the door so if you're a man and you're watching this start opening girls doors it's the sweetest thing ever it is and here's the thing about it they deserve it they do deserve it but like it also makes you feel really good as a man yeah yeah it does it's like you know what yeah i am going to treat my girl right and i'm going to go the extra mile because she deserves it men so highly recommend it on both ends of the spectrum trying something new here we go got the patio to ourselves literally kyle reserved the whole patio   always good sunsets and that's not even the sunset the sunset's on the opposite side yeah that's just the uh what do you call it first course is here a lot of so good fried seafood this is my happy dance you want to put down the phone and pray with me yes this needs to be filmed this needs to be filmed me and kyle okay so this is what's going on we're discussing pranks we're discussing surprises so a pre-wedding prank and like breaking up with my fiance before the wedding and i think it would be a huge hit on youtube it definitely would but then i was like i there's no way i could execute that and that's accurate and not as executed and then i asked if he could execute it and he said yes for sure and here's what i'm saying is i could execute it up until the point of you crying or you really falling forward and believing in it and then it would just like break my heart and i would cave and feel so bad but i could definitely i don't even know what i would do to you well you know i don't know what you would do to me either i don't know if i would be i feel like i'd be mad what if i said but babe hashtag youtube views do it for the views for the views that's the reason why so many youtube couples break up that reason right there consensus is we will not be doing that right consensus is she will not be doing that well now i know if he tried to do it i'd be like i'd literally be in denial and be like you're joking we decided to do a split plate oh kyle that's his happy dance out already we're out we're moving okay guys i hope you enjoyed the video so far we wanted to sit down and actually talk a little bit about what happened after that last clip so it's been a couple days yeah we actually that night ended up having one of like our biggest fights ever and we just thought it was an important thing to kind of mention and talk about because i think that's what is so often left out of a lot of youtube videos is you don't get to see that part and obviously to each person their own whatever they feel comfortable with sharing we are very open about our relationships and ups and downs so we wanted to talk about that i think a big thing we struggle with is how to communicate during conflict great at communicating until conflict arises yeah and it's like what the other person needs that's what we're still figuring out i more get frustrated and just like a little annoyed with you like pretty frequently but i know i don't really get angry at you frequently i don't know i thought you would say kind of frequently no a couple times a week oh that you get with me yeah sure yeah yeah but you rarely get mad so it happens every once in a while so that's why we haven't had much practice figuring it out so basically long story short of what happened we were having our date everything was going smooth we started having a conversation that was a little more serious so i communicated where i was coming from and then i felt judged and unheard and at that point i started getting a little offense offensive defensive defensive defensive i get to a point eventually in conflict where i just tend to shut down and i'm like you know what it's not worth it forget it and i'm done which she hates so that's where she doesn't know what to do or should she say something should she just leave me alone and give me space or still show me love like she has no idea i went to the gym after the date i don't know what you were doing but worshipping you know like this isn't who kyle is yeah so just because he's acting like this and to just stay in god's presence and ask him for his patience and love and pray for me pray for kyle yeah that's what i was doing so that's what she was doing and um we we just realized it's like we needed help with this i was planning to come back and talk to her after the gym and you know throughout that time i'm praying and talking to god um and trying to surrender my emotions which she wasn't aware of she thought i was just disappearing and not spending any time with god there's like no communication she just shuts down so i'm like what the heck is right so she thinks she's fighting the battle alone but literally there's little does she know i'm out there you know also praying for us and just surrendering to god it was funny i came back and i was going to talk to her about going to see somebody and she basically already reached out to somebody for us to come see which bothered me again because i'm like why didn't you talk to me first about it like i was gonna talk to you um and it just kept building and then um yeah basically we went and we we saw um some spiritual uh mentors yeah we went to our premarital counselors yeah that you know we definitely value the relationship with the lord and with one another yeah afterwards we just had a lot more clarity what did you learn about me and what i need during these times so with you i learned that you need just communication um instead of me just shutting down and going to the gym i need to be like hey babe like i need space so i'm gonna go to the gym but i'm still praying i'm still fighting for us you know you're not in this alone i just need space i learned about kyle is that he does not like to pray in the middle of an argument he prefers to go and pray alone and not have me like force a prayer i guess yeah in the middle of it and then also that you do need that space and you need me to trust you while you're away to be praying in all that yeah and that's a big thing i was feeling is feeling like she doesn't trust me she doesn't believe in me she doesn't have faith in me so then all these insecurities started coming in and that built on top of it um so that's a big thing is like her trusting me in those moments too um and just realizing like this is just kind of how i'm wired you know like i i just i'm wired differently where i need space to unwind and just because i don't want to pray in the moment doesn't mean um you know that i'm not you know still aligned with god and one thing that they said during our session was whoever you were before the relationship like who you were your whole life that's what you're gonna bring into your marriage so because kyle his whole life learned the way to deal with conflict with shutting down and shutting people out that's what he brings into this relationship that he has to work through and me in my past i'm sure i have like unhealthy things or unhealthy relationship habits that i am bringing in to this marriage and that's why i think it's so important to try to work as many of us out before you meet them otherwise you get to work it out with your spouse which is an amazing thing too i know on our last conflict video there were comments like kyle shouldn't have gotten mad about that it's like you're right i'm perfect you're right yeah we're imperfect and a lot of that comes from insecurities of our past most anytime we're upset it's because it's hurting an old wound that someone else left us and like we get to help the other person heal from that but if i were to just be like that's ridiculous kyle you shouldn't have gotten mad at that that gives him no grace and no space to be honest and for us to bring whatever it is to the light to god to heal i've been doing a little bit of a bible study on a video that i'm doing on my channel but i just flex your post-it note reflects it um but no one verse just came to mind galatians 6 verse 2 it says share each other's burdens and in this way obey the law of christ and when it comes to us having these burdens to share these with each other and to help each other um you know grow in these and grow through these is super important not judge people right but actually like share each other's burdens carry each other's burdens and then also and in james 5 verse 16 it says confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed the earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results so as we confess this to one another and pray for one another um in this you know there will be healing you know god's word tells us that so it's just humbling yourselves and being open and honest and transparent and coming together um to overcome these things in christ and that's that's basically that's how you do it man it's not always easy it's not always fun it's not always glamorous no it doesn't always feel the best but the reward is great and after we had our talk with our counselors i felt like we were a lot closer yeah loving towards one another i think we got to release like a lot of things that we were holding on to yeah not good okay well i hope you guys enjoyed this video yeah and hopefully that helps you know somebody out there in a relationship dealing with something yep all right guys love you have an amazing day love you guys welcome to this video i'm so excited because it is my bachelorette

you don't know me so everyone thinks they know you yeah and what it is is and i literally get to this every time i say do i remind you of dory the fish and they always go oh my god that's what it is so anyway i look like dory the fish from finding nemo put on a plate courtney's got it oh my goodness wait put it on the paper plate i got him you got him with the balloon well he's not okay ready put him on the paper plate what's happening   do i go in order no you just you take it you have to get to it you have to guess who got it oh my gosh um         what is the naughtiest thing that brad has ever done to you     what is your favorite part of the bride's body     my infection     to sleep the next morning last night we opened gifts and played a couple games and now we're headed back to the hotel to get brunch anyone want to share a fun fact you guys have something to say remember that you want to share with the camera i farted last night yeah thank you that's a fun fact   my name   oh look at that smile oh my gosh get a close-up of it i'm just kidding just got our braces off i did that's my fun fact too oh okay oh there it is okay so in italy it's a tradition if you gift oysters to the bride and the groom then you're wishing good fertility on them so i bought them three yeah because we want some babies yeah apparently we want babies   so we went boating it but then the boat kind of broke so then we went back and did some paddle boarding and and now we had to go back to the house and change really fast and now there is a surprise and none of us know what it is at least in this group right right so we're walking to a surprise i know there's pizza because pizza my guess is like a picnic wow it's so cute       before everyone does someone just got proposed to on the beach right down from us it's now sunday morning our last full day here we're all leaving a lot of us are leaving tomorrow some of us are leaving today we came into san diego to get some coffee and then we're probably just gonna have a beach day     we've had a very eventful day kind of eventful but not really we went to the beach my little sister got stung by stingray really badly so we had to put her foot in like hot water it was bleeding really bad she's still recovering she's limping a little bit and then we headed over to   what is this the fairy stop and found some cute sweatshirts got some matching sweatshirts and now we're just gonna watch the sunset and then we're gonna head back to the airbnb for dinner here's the viewer   harry potter okay another wedding thing is perfume i have seen so many people say that on your wedding day you should pick out a new perfume so then anytime you wear it after your wedding it'll bring back like those nostalgia feelings and moments because of the scent because there's so much memory that's tied to sense i know for me like i can i remember people's colognes and anytime i smell it like years later it makes me think of them so i really wanted to do that however i am not a perfume person at all i never wear perfume i don't really want to spend a ton of money on perfumes that i'm only going to be wearing one day of my life and then for special occasions after that so i was really excited that dossier reached out to me and wanted to work together because they have luxury scents at a fair price all of their perfumes are only 29 i think there's one that's 39 but all the rest are 29 and they're all inspired by like luxury scents and what's really cool is they mail you them to your house and give you a sample and that way if you don't like it there's no risk so i'm gonna show you them we ended up getting three cents one of them is unisex one is for kyle and one is for females and then as you can see on here it says what they're inspired by but what i really love about these is that they give you this little tester so you can spray this first and then if you don't like it you just don't open this back and you can return it for free so these are the different ones i got oriental woody eight this one's inspired by victor and flower bomb which is a really popular one test this one out this one's oriental woody seven hmm wait i really like this one i think this is the female one that's nice okay fan of that this is the oriental woody eight this is the unisex one honestly i would say not the biggest fan of this one which is perfect because all i did was test the sample and i can send this one back oh wow this one is so good this is fresh 46 and it's definitely fresh i think this is the male one and it smells like you just got out of like a shower like your man is clean so i definitely want kyle to wear this one this is the one i think i will be wearing just a really beautiful packaging i'm going to wear this today because i also think it's important to try it on your skin too to make sure it like goes well with your body chemistry because i know scents can completely change based on like your stuff you know what i'm saying anyway so i'm really excited for that got that taken care of now we will have a scent that will always remind us remind us of our wedding day if you guys want to try out docier i highly recommend them so many people say they do smell almost exactly like the inspiration so if you do have a favorite perfume and you're looking for an alternative that's cheaper definitely check out their website i will have my discount code and links in the description some wedding updates my friend justine came over and helped me cut out these squares for the napkins then these are gonna be all of the table runners i cut out 14 of those and then those are a little bit shorter just to use for decoration i still have a ton more fabric because i didn't realize but this is kind of like two pieces so you can definitely keep it together and use this as one runner but since i wanted to make 100 napkins i decided to cut this down the center and yeah this is what we did we just put a big square and then started cutting the napkins out around it some other wedding stuff that i ordered from amazon i got a three pack of these ribbons they're all these neutrals and then i got a four pack of these and basically i'll probably use these to tie around our bouquets also in like other decor maybe to wrap around the napkins then i got this really beautiful champagne colored ring box to put our rings in all of this is from amazon and then i got these little stickers for the bottom of our place cards which i've been working on non-stop this is like the setup so i've been taking all these postage boxes and using them as my spray painting stations these are all the ones i've done these ones are all done so yeah this is the color i've been using on them it is the color cinnamon and yeah i'm going to put those little stickers on the bottom of here so people can use them as coasters right now i'm debating if i want to do them now before i ship them to the calligrapher or if i want to do them later part of me thinks i should just do literally everything i can right now when i am like a month and a half out from the wedding and that way i'm not super stressed because that would be something i needed to do probably like a week or two before the wedding so i might start putting all those stickers on that sounds so tedious and you like throw on like a movie or youtube video but anyway i'm still cutting napkins i still need to cut like a hundred more napkins so that's what i'm going to be doing for the next hour probably kyle went to go to the store to buy buckets so we can start dyeing i bought some like red dye i'm hoping to just dye the runner is like a little bit of an awful white color and then i want to dye the napkins more of a terracotta color but almost all rit dye is like sold out because everybody's tie-dying during quarantine so it was kind of a challenge to find a rit dye formula that i liked that had all the colors in stock so i just bought what i could and i'm going to try to combine them to make a terracotta color yeah i think we'll be fine we'll be fine i don't think i've given you guys like a bedroom update but y'all get a sneak peek i absolutely love the light in here at this time of day so beautiful and then i'm gonna put like a chair i think in there eventually something else that's exciting is kyle's ring came in the mail so we ordered his ring off of etsy trying to get some better lighting and that is what it looks like it's silver and then the edges are gold he wasn't exactly sure what he wanted he did like this one but he never wears rings so he doesn't really know what kind of jewelry guy he is so i don't know i don't know if he like loves it but if you never wear jewelry before you're kind of indifferent so i'm hoping he falls in love with it as he wears it more but it's super timeless um some other ones he looked at were like black he also looked at some that were like black and gold and black and rose gold so a little bit more statement pieces but we ended up coming to this one because it's simple it's timeless matches well and yeah so hopefully he grows to love it once he starts like wearing it more i don't know if i've given you guys a honeymoon update but we have officially booked our honeymoon praise the lord that has been the one thing that has been really up in the air when it comes to the wedding was the honeymoon obviously all the places that we were trying to book to were closing down or we weren't even allowed to fly there so i ended up just going on thumbtack and finding a travel agent and my friend maddie used a travel agent for hers and she said she highly recommends it it's actually i didn't know a lot of travel agents are free because they just work off commission from all the resorts so we found heather travel bliss i think it's called i'll have her linked in the description yeah she just asked us what we wanted asked us our budget and then she sent us some options gave us the whole itinerary and she speci specializes in mexico so she had just gone to mexico like a week or two ago so she has a really good idea and sense of what it's like to travel there and she's visited i think over 150 resorts in cancun so anyway that's where we're going for a honeymoon we're going to cancun i never thought i would go to mexico for my honeymoon because i've been there before but i've actually never been to cancun and it's going to be a much different experience because the only time i've been to mexico was like spring break mostly so this is going to be like a nice romantic all-inclusive resort we're gonna stay at two resorts so four nights at the first one and then we're gonna hop over to this other resort which is actually on its own island there's some other resorts there too it's not like a private island for the resort but yeah it's on it's on an island so the water is really clear and that one we're staying at for five nights so nine nights in total honeymoon in cancun we're leaving the thursday after our wedding so about four days after our wedding we got some more exciting projects happening kyle just got back from home depot and the difference oh yeah shiny so this one's still dirty but he is making the sign holder for our acrylic welcome sign thank you mr handyman i'll link the tutorial he's following in the description if you're interested and i'll insert a photo here of what he's making i am starting the dye baths i have a few in there i'm starting with these two i did one teaspoon of golden yellow and one teaspoon of tan and i'm gonna do a sample strip to see if i like it so they turned out definitely too yellow not a good look and i was like well now i have to dump this whole bin out and then refill it i think next time i'm literally just going to put a little bit of the tan in and that's it it's hard because these are black bins so i can't really tell what color it is kyle has made a lot of progress with this sign we're getting there the sign holder these 90s are being painted this is the final product thank you kyle it looks great all that's left to do is we have to bond it together yeah because right now oops because right now it would fall over really easily but it looks so good and it was really simple to make yeah super simple i am currently trying to dye all of the napkins we cut them out of this gauze into i think about like 15 square 15 inch squares so now i just have my big tub i put three gallons of water one cup of salt and now i'm going to play with all my colors and just test it out to try to get the color i want i want them to be a like rust orange color so i think what i'm going to do is use tangerine cocoa brown i hope these work out nicely because my table runners did not work out so we have to dye all of those again as well okay the color is looking pretty good it's actually a little bit darker than it even is showing on camera so yeah i think i'm gonna let it sit for like 20 minutes and then i will rinse it and make sure it's like the perfect color okay i wanted to show you some other wedding updates first one is this huge copper stand and we are going to be using this for the seating chart so here is the inspiration i want to hang acrylic pieces from it and then probably put some florals around it as well this is what it looks like right now i believe it is six foot tall and five feet wide i'm gonna have him change up the bottom we're gonna actually move it more to the center of this and we're gonna trim this piece so it's not as big but yeah this is what it looks like so just imagine some like clear like hanging string clear string with acrylic pieces and like a nice floral arrangement on it but yeah that is one wedding update we also got some things in the mail while i was on my bachelorette party so i got our guest book i'll have all of this stuff linked below i just wanted like a linen plain guest book and then we will most likely have um a two like instant cameras and then we'll have people tape their pictures in and write us notes in here so these are the boutonnieres that i got from the guys i ordered them on etsy again i will have them linked i asked her to customize it a little bit by putting in these pink flowers because that'll match the bridesmaids better i might switch out this ribbon for something not so purpley because i have a bunch of extra ribbon from etsy so that is the only change i might make another thing that came in was our cake sign okay i got it out this is what it looks like it is just this really pretty script font it says mr and mrs wolfgang and i will insert a photo here of our cake inspiration so just imagine this on top of that cake right before my bachelorette party i got my nails done i was testing out a color that i think i want to use for the wedding i don't know if every salon is different but i believe this is opi 134 and it's just this like really light pink it's almost nude colored but i think it's really beautiful and classic so i think this is the color i'm going to go for on my wedding day nails while the napkins are dying i'm going to work on some other things i'm working with something borrowed blooms for my wedding day decor i'm just gonna insert some pictures of what i'm ordering the first thing i'm getting is the taylor bridal bouquet which looks like this i'm going to be using this bouquet for my adventure photo shoot up in sedona two days after the wedding me my photographer and kyle are gonna go up to like sedona or horseshoe bend and take some really beautiful photos in my wedding dress so i wanted a faux bouquet for those photos just to make it really easy i am also ordering these candle sets and my venue doesn't really want exposed cam candles especially because they're outside but i really do love the look of the candlesticks i feel like it adds some height to the decorations and the candles so i found these also i'm ordering the spiral seated eucalyptus garlands i'm ordering probably at least one for each table and then i think i'm also going to have them lining the aisle so i might order some extra for that and what we're gonna do is pop in some real roses into the garlands because they are just like the eucalyptus look and those will be going across all of the tables like so this is like the big picture of inspiration for my wedding tables we are doing a buffet so i'm not gonna have any plastic plates on the tables i just don't think that would look good so instead we'll just have like the napkin the silverware their name card and which is like the tile me and my wedding planner brittany are going to do a mock-up of everything i'm going to take pictures with her she's going to come and organize all of my decorations into boxes and label everything so i would highly recommend her or if you are not in the arizona area i'm sure she would travel but i would definitely recommend having at least the day of coordinator because it makes such a difference i cannot imagine doing this without her so anyway that's what i'm working on right now i'm gonna place this order and then i'll update you on the napkins a little later the color turned out so pretty it's not as orange in person i'm trying to get like a more realistic lighting there we go it's definitely like that rusty orange color it's super vibrant so i'll probably maybe start off by putting it in for less time but i absolutely love this color so i'm gonna start putting in all of the napkins i decided to replace these really pink ribbons with these like peachy color ones or like tan ones i think they look a lot better and they match the flowers a lot better than this color so i just bought all of these on amazon wow i absolutely love these i think they look a lot better with these new ribbons on them so i'm gonna throw them all in a plastic bag i'm gonna start organizing our wedding stuff we got all these big bins so i can start kind of organizing things for the tables and just things we need to pack so i'm designing the sign that the ring bearer is going to walk down the aisle with this is what i have so what i did was i just went on canva found a font that i liked and then printed these out and then i i tried to do it all in one piece but those were too small so i just printed them bigger and now i'm placing the words and then i'll probably just go over them with a white chalk marker i went to go pick up my wedding dress today i had some alterations and editions added to it so it was so excited to see the finished product it is so beautiful i love it so much i'm so excited to show you guys i wish i could show you early and now me and kyle are going to our venue walk through this is our 30-day walk through which is crazy we're literally a month out from our wedding it's crazy to think in three weeks it will literally be my wedding week that's wild but at the same time i'm so excited and i just pray time goes by fast because i am so done with my season of engagement i'm done with it until you know hidden lake is outfitting this yeah this is cool for sure yeah yeah so so welcome and brittany i'm assuming this is your first time here too right second oh you've been here before okay there's gonna be a generator here she'll be set up here and then you'll have the table here okay wedding update as you guys saw we went and toured our venue and that was lovely a little stressful because it was 114 degrees out so it was so hot all of us were super sweaty so it was pretty overwhelming and exhausting to be out there but thankfully the weather is supposed to get better in arizona starting next week so we are 30 now 29 days out from the wedding and it's still 114 degrees in arizona but next week it's supposed to drop down to low 100s it's actually going to be 95 which is like so great for here because it's been like a solid month of 110 degrees plus if you guys could pray for the wedding weather that we would be blessed with a beautiful night and a beautiful sunset and it wouldn't be too hot that would be lovely um i want to give you guys an update on the napkins me and the napkins we have some beef i don't know we have some bad bad blood i'm actually getting like there's sensation running through my body right now as i'm about to talk to you about these napkins because let me tell you i feel like i want to cry because i'm so done with these napkins anyway i ended up dying the napkins like two or three times two times and there was a hundred and twenty of them so it took a long time it took me two days but they are done they do not look perfect they are all different colors let me just show you here is my box of napkins some of them are like this pink mauve color some of them are a little darker and more orange it's just it's fall okay so the other day i went to trader joe's this is how i expect them to like look on the tables and we just put some flowers in here i still have a bunch more to do i'm just seeing how these ones turn out as they dry and i think it'll be fine it's just it would be nice to have these all done before the wedding that way i don't have to worry about it but all the flowers are over here so i've just been cutting a little bit of these off and plopping them in so that is the napkin situation i started organizing all of our wedding stuff we got like the welcome table box cake stuff i tried to do this sign i think it looks pretty bad but i don't know does it look bad i guess it's not horrible from far away it really doesn't look bad but when you get up close it's rough anyway got the rings the marriage license faces started plopping some candles our wedding sparklers came in i'll probably take like one of these vases with me or even that one's kind of cool maybe i'll put that and just put all of them in here maybe i should do that beforehand but yeah just started organizing all of all of our stuff early i got these suspenders from amazon for kyle and the groomsman i wanted to order them first to see how i liked them and honestly these are like the most real and high quality leather look looking ones that i found okay that is the wedding update there probably will be many more wedding updates probably a few other wedding videos but i'm gonna cut it off here because i feel like there was a lot jam packed into this video so i hope you guys enjoyed and if you guys didn't know me and kyle started a couple's channel and that is going to be the channel that our wedding video is going to be on so definitely subscribe to that i'll have it linked in the description we should have a couple videos on there already and i don't know when you guys are watching this but we may have already announced that we are going to have our wedding live streamed and you guys are all invited to it uh and the entire announcement video will be linked as well if it's up already alright i love you guys   bye hello welcome to today's video i'm so excited to be partnering with 50 flowers for this video and if you can't tell it's going to be all about flowers as you guys know i've been planning my wedding it is in a few weeks and i really wanted to partner with a flower company i wanted to do the flowers myself which meant i needed to find a wholesaler online to order all my flowers from so i actually decided to get a diy kit before the wedding just so i could film this video and also practice putting together a bouquet so the first step in the process is meeting with one of their consultants i met with a lady named emily and she was so amazing and helpful so basically i just started by sending her some inspiration photos for what i wanted my bouquet to look like and then we went back and forth she started sending me links for all the different flowers that she thinks would really fit those bouquets kind of got to choose what i liked and disliked and from there we put together my entire flower order after our little consultation she sent me some flower care tips she sent me a recipe list that breaks down how many flowers are supposed to be in each bouquet or centerpiece literally anything you could think of she will send you a recipe so you can put those together and it can just be so much easier the day leading up to your weddings all of my flowers will be delivered three days before my wedding and that way they can all get hydrated and then they'll be set to go for the wedding day these aren't the exact flowers i'll be using for my wedding i'll insert some photos now of the inspiration we went with along with the order i actually made and which flowers we're going to get but for now i have one of their rustic diy kits and i'm gonna just have fun putting an arrangement together with you guys so i have only done this a few times so let's see how this goes i wanted to get some like really pretty fall colors so i'm going to start by just picking some of my favorites so the way they do it is they have some focal flowers greenery and also some flowers just to accent the focals so my focals i think for this bouquet are going to be these two this yellow one and this like rustic reddish orange one and then i'm gonna have some spray roses um as well as these carnations to the accent so right now i'm just kind of picking what i think will look nice together we also have these really fun drooping flowers i'm not sure the name of these but i think those will add some cool like waterfall shapes we have this really tall like greenery back here   i'm gonna grab a couple pieces of these they also sent me some of this which is i think a canary grass but i thought it was super cute definitely goes along with the boho inspiration that i have then they also have this really pretty like trailing grass and the color is kind of like a mix between like a red and purple so i pulled all the flowers that i am thinking about using and i'm just going to start playing with it i'm going to start with a few focal flowers and start putting them together i've been really enjoying watching like youtube tutorials on how to put together bouquets uh i know another option is to go to like a local flower workshop he's on this side this one i'm gonna pull off   this is really pretty but i need to trim it down to fit the bouquet a little bit better this will be a good one to give it some height   i'm just taking some regular kitchen scissors to trim everything honestly making these arrangements is very therapeutic so if you're looking for a little hobby definitely recommend okay i feel like we're getting somewhere i'm going to try to place this one oh that is really pretty and i'm just going to worry about cutting this later so for my wedding i'm actually having one of my friends do the arranging for me i might help a little bit but i'm just thinking it could be a little hectic so i recruited some friends another idea is to ask your bridesmaids and to help put their own bouquet together have like a big sleepover the night of the wedding or like the night before and just do a bouquet party put that back here   i think these white ones are a great pop okay what other wedding updates can i give you guys i actually worked on my vows for the first time last night i don't know why i just started getting some inspiration i think this would be a fun piece to kind of have in the front like that so i started to get a wave of inspiration i just went in my notes on my phone and just started writing down just some like random thoughts or like anything that kind of came to mind a few of my vows and then i just tried to form them together   and then i just try to form them together to flow um writing has always been something i've enjoyed so i didn't find the process too difficult i'm actually gonna start clearing out this vase so i can put these flowers in here yeah so far i haven't found the process like too difficult it was actually really fun i don't really know how long vows are supposed to be but i need to time myself doing them out loud just to make sure you know you try to make it a mix of like light-hearted funny but also like serious and romantic kyle's gonna do his vows first which i feel like will be really nice because then he can kind of just set the tone for us both i think these need to be a little bit down south more so the reason why i wanted to do the florals on my own is because it's gonna save me so much money and i really do love like the creativity of it um the flowers themselves that is a big price that's built into a florist's price so taking out that price really helped us on our budget this is kind of what i have going so far look at that view from the top so pretty okay so i think i need another yellow flower over here and you guys i am a total beginner i have only done this like one time but it's honestly pretty easy it might be because i have a very creative mind but if you guys want to do the flowers for your wedding alone i would highly recommend it here is super k right now i personally want a smaller bouquet i don't love like the really big ones so i'll probably build it out just a little bit more sorry it's really hard to focus on like chatting with you guys while i am doing this but hopefully this is entertaining oh those look really nice there i'm just gonna have to take off these bottom ones they say it really helps to do it in front of a mirror this is great because i'm doing it in front of a camera so i get to kind of like check my progress as i'm going i think this is honestly like really pretty all right anything else i feel like maybe more greenery would look nice right now i'm not feeling any nerves about the wedding i don't know if that's gonna grow as we get closer i'm hoping it's not i hope it's just filled with excitement i actually decided to get my hair and makeup done off-site so i'm gonna get it done at a studio and i'm gonna spend that morning completely alone and it's so cool because you can just really customize your wedding day to fit you know your personality and me i personally thrive on alone time and definitely need a lot of alone time so considering the fact that i'm gonna be surrounded by friends and family for like three days straight it actually worked out perfectly to have my makeup done at a studio instead of the house that way i have the whole morning of my wedding a solid three hours just to myself to spend time with jesus and i can bring my bible or read my devotional while i'm getting my hair and makeup done throw on some worship music and i can just really use that time to recharge so that is my tip to you if you guys need to customize some alone time into your you know schedule i would definitely recommend that another thing i'm doing is me and kyle are going to get to the venue alone first and we're going to do a prayer together and that way we'll just and he's not going to see me we're not doing a first look or anything so i'm just going to come behind his back he's going to pray for us but that way we also get a little bit of alone time and like a little alone time um right before the ceremony as well which i think i am really gonna appreciate as the day gets closer okay update on the bouquet this is what it looks like i think it is so so pretty like i said my bouquet is going to be a little bit different but i did want to pick one of their diy kits just to get some inspiration of and each diy kit you can order it to um fit your like wedding size needs i'm trying to decide if i like this guy this high or if i want it a little lower let me try to pull him out without ruining anything okay i think we're gonna just leave him here and here to be trailing okay i'm gonna add a few more of this canary grass right here on the side this is honestly so therapeutic if you're just looking for a summer activity with your friends feel free to order like a diy kit and just have like a little flower party with your friends that would be such a cute like birthday idea or just like summer activity i think i'm gonna add some more white spray roses i guess i'll share some other details if you guys don't know me and kyle decided we started a youtube channel first off so if you're not subscribed definitely go subscribe and some exciting news we decided to live stream our wedding so you guys can all watch the

october 4th 2020. okay guys i think i have reached the shape and look that i want i will give you a full preview all right so from here i will just trim these to my desired length uh oh this guy's going a little rogue and then i will wrap it with some floral tape and then i think it would be really pretty to add on a ribbon ouch oops wow that really hurt adding ribbon is such an easy way to elevate your bouquet and just add a really pretty detail i actually found my ribbon in two places um i found some on etsy and then i actually decided to check amazon and they had some really good deals on ribbon i think this bouquet specifically would look really pretty with just like a tan neutral ribbon or even like i don't know like a rust orange color they say to cut the flowers at a diagonal supposed to help with water absorption if any of you guys have any tips for me or have done your flowers yourself for your wedding please let me know all the help i can get the better here is the finished bouquet i added some of this ribbon i got these ribbons off of amazon alright guys i hope you enjoyed this video and it was helpful for you in case you are wedding planning or just

to share my journey i also had you guys send in questions on instagram so if you're not following me there definitely do and they did a wonderful job of answering all of your wedding day makeup questions and hair questions so i hope you guys enjoy this video   so       how do you make wedding makeup last without it sweating off okay well you don't sweat no uh it's honestly the products the products that we use are for longevity purposes um you know cater to that because if you're using a product that's not gonna like dry dry down on the skin it won't stick so okay a lot of just uh products that last long dry down to the skin also um setting the makeup what do you mean by dry down to the skin just like a dryer a drying a little no i'm not drying but you know like when you put like something on your hand like how nice it's doing here if we were to let it sit on her hand it'll remain on her hand and then if you like do this then it won't move so that that dries down that's okay okay um estee lauder um i know uh we use a lot of like estee lauder we use a lot of tarte shape tape um the nars one is nice but it does move if you don't set it so that's another trick they want to oh that's cool so you can like test them on your hands mm-hmm yep that's what i do when i'm at the stores like if i'm at old store sephora i'll like try a foundation and then i'll walk around with it on my hand and then when i'm done when i'm shopping around i'll like swipe it and see if it moves and if it moves then it then i don't want it because it's not going to stick later on all right best way to cover a breakout that pops up the morning up pop it pop it okay i always ask my bites to pop it oh wow okay um just because if it's only if it's a white head okay um that just kind of helps reduce like if she happened to like do this and then there's blood later on so i normally just and you'll want to put like a warm hot towel on it before popping it that way you just like do a little pressure on the breakout and then it'll just light right out okay and then you just cover it with like and then we cover yep and then we cover it once it like dries that's the first thing i'll probably have them do is i'll have them you know pop their pimples and get ready and you'll want to use you'll want to color correct it if it's red you want to go straight in there with your concealer okay and you use green on red right um we so you can use like tart shape tape we'll probably use like if it's red we'll probably use like tan sand or medium those have like yellow orange undertones and that just cancels it right out and then we'll go back in there once it dries down we'll go back in there with like a brighter color my hair is long and heavy so my curls always fall out any tips so she'll need waves in the hair versus actual curl okay um usually when it's a wave in the hair they're able to keep the wave because the hair is heavy so it just it sits on the way versus curls where they just fall does that make sense yeah well you can do it what do you have a curling iron um i have a wand okay wands are nice but they i feel like they those are good for like maybe these kind of curls because you're just wrapping it and then letting it go with the curling iron you have actual tension in the hair yeah so you can choose that route or you can use a flat iron any prep you would recommend on face or hair before styling that the bride can do yeah another person asks if they should have their hair freshly washed yes yes and yes okay so for the skin always exfoliate before okay before like a good nice exfoliating like double cleanse exfoliate moisturize and then you can put your prepping products such as like your primer your mattifying stuff anything that you would use you know okay so definitely yes to that and definitely yes to clean hair clean hair um disclaimer though some people know their hair more than others so if they say like oh my hair works it curls better like on second day yeah and that's fine okay do you like when they have it the natural texture you put like i blew mine out natural texture okay because it kind of it helps us um one for example like if you came in here and you straightened your hair the night before right yeah and you're like i want i want these really like nice beachy waves well what will happen is it'll stay and then once you leave because you straightened your hair it's gonna fall okay so it's always best to come in with like your own natural texture so that way we kind of know what we need to do to get you to that desired look okay so next time i should come in air dry yeah just like air dry okay yeah i guess i'm blessed that my hair will still curl after i blow it out yeah and you have some you have some um dimension and texture in your hair because of like the coloring that's also something brides can take into consideration um if they want some dimension in the hair if their hair doesn't hold your curl they'll want to maybe either look into extensions okay or they can add some like balayage to their hair okay what foundation lasts all day for weddings okay depends on the skin type i would say oily um some double wear estee lauder for dryer skin you can always do like a face neck and body there's a dior face and body   how do i make my foundation not look cakey i need to let the foundation dry down dry down do you know how i keep saying dry out yeah it's like so important so before you would put like anything else on you let your foundation dry down so i always give this like analogy when you start putting water in pancake mix you know how it's like super thick super like you gotta keep any water yeah it's like that okay so if you add powder to your wet makeup it's gonna get cakey yeah don't want that but we could add some chocolate chips yes we can how do you guys determine what style of hair and makeup will fit the bride or do you usually let the bride you know like pick um we ask for like inspiration just because we want to see what attracts the bright um a lot of times we are just catering to like the eye shape the face shape the lips um the hair type yeah you know everything is taken into consideration we're not just the dress yep the dress absolutely so if you have like a higher neck up those are always nice to kind of bring up like everything but yeah you're having like a strapless dress you can always choose to do like a down do you can always just do a lower like uh romantic side updo do you think my hairstyle could give us my dress i would definitely say so it's more on the buttholier side products are good that stay if you're crying   so the same as long as you're setting your makeup and you want to you want to dab and not swipe if you're going to cry what about mascara or do your guys's eyelashes stay pretty well yeah so those stay really well the mascara that you want to use is waterproof of course um we like using the mac one we like using uh what's the one by two face better than better than sex right that one's really good does the type of lash glue you use matter um yes it does it definitely does is the other ones no but they're the lashes they have individuals is it hard for people to learn how to use your lashes the individual ones like do you have tips for putting those on because i can definitely link those yeah so those are you'll have to practice definitely breakfast yeah just because once you get the hang of it it's like so easy do you guys have any educational videos on lash application we do perfect we do yeah and i know if you use those uh anissa uses a mirror to kind of help her put them on and then why do you recommend that um your guys's lashes over first people yeah so because we're so customized here um everything that we do is catered to like again to bring out your features um so individual lashes give us that ability to give you the customized eyelash versus if we just popped on like a strip lash it won't give you the same effect it'll just end up being like yeah i feel like i've tried lashes and it makes my eyes look tired or like them down right yeah awesome so we'll have their lashes linked in the description if anyone's interested any tips for making makeup look good in person and in photos she feels like this is tough blend blend blend that's it do you think for i i know for like dancing they say to like dress up your makeup more and make it more intense for because like cameras and stuff will wash it out do you guys stick to that or you yes or no will you take into consideration the photographer videographer that you're using because their style yes will also help translate like if you had someone who was more on the airier side yeah then we would have probably added probably a little more just because the plug ended blow blowing out you know yeah but like because you're a videographer and photographer she's more in the warmer she's more true to color then you're okay to stay within your what would you say sets the bridal look apart from a traditional glamour everyday makeup good question i i'd like to say what sets apart bridal i think every day you're you're not really focusing on like the thing that's going to bring out your features you're kind of just like applying right because you get through the day so i think bridal makeup is is apart from everyday makeup because we're now we're now taking that makeup and placing it in the right places and actually like with intensity yeah like intentionally right bringing out their features exactly what would look good so interesting just over time do you get good at like looking at someone's face shape and eye shape and just knowing yeah i was just talking about this with uh one of my clients yesterday how how some artists just kind of only do like one look on that person and then move it on to the next person like everyone is different so everyone like needs something different right and so i think uh we've kind of we take that into consideration a lot yeah not everyone deserves like the same look yeah needs to be customized yeah what's one thing like you always customize to each person like the eye look or contour definitely every like everything yeah we're pretty skin focused we're eyelash focus we're lip focus and eyebrow focus yeah um i would say those are the things that we're really like passionate about when we're trying to bring out the best in someone okay so you guys invented your own light for makeup why do you guys use it okay so one because we are in different settings all the time so we're in hotel rooms we're in airbnbs uh we don't have access to sometimes we don't have access to natural lighting yeah and so with our light you're able to get that either the golden hour look or just like daytime look at any time right yeah we also work pretty early in the morning sometimes and so that just kind of helps us get the nice perfect photo with the right light in in any setting yeah you know because you can change the temperature on it uh-huh that's awesome so it goes from cool tones to warm tones and um it can go really really bright or really really low would you just recommend that for like having for photos or is it helpful when people are getting ready it's both yeah it's like super versatile for putting in the veil any tips to help it like stay in or placement of it yep so it just depends on your veil right so most times the veil is made for it to sit right at the round of the head okay so that's why it sits normally like right in the middle because that's where the head you know basically runs off i feel like most people think it goes lower but it's not higher yeah because if you did put it lower right for example if you had a cathedral which is nice and long kind of like you're right it's kind of heavy at the end so guess what if you put it down here it falls you can't see it so when you have it on the crown it naturally opens up and then now exactly yes gotcha okay and then do you guys use like bobby pins in it to help it um not most times because it has a little comb but if we see that it it is going to maybe fall out then we normally put in somebody i feel like every time i have tried on a veil it doesn't feel like secure really maybe there's just a technique to put it in i saw one lady like kind of made a little s motion as she put it in mm-hmm yeah you have to like wiggle it in the hair okay and most times there's like back combing in the hair which will help it'll help it you know trials are are for both obviously right gives you a chance to give you a chance to obviously meet your artists get to vibe with them um it also helps us determine the best look for you like as a bride right yeah gives us a chance to get to know who you are and give you like that that like look that you're that you deserve that and it just helps us with like knowing how the um how stuff is staying on your skin how everything is kind of like working yeah and that way we can give you recommendations if we have to do you ever like do a hairstyle and then they're like oh wait this wasn't what i thought it was gonna look like and then you have to oh yeah trials we do multiple hairstyles especially if they're a look that maybe they're wanting but we feel it it won't work because of like maybe they have like not a lot of hair or they just you know a lot of circumstances where we have to maybe you can't um go a different exactly and you know we don't want to be like yeah let's do it and then yeah we can't   oh all right guys that is it for today's video let me know what you guys think of my wedding day makeup and hair look i am so excited the wedding is literally right around the corner it is 11 days when i'm filming this clip right here so make sure you are subscribed to mine and kyle's couple's channel i'll have it linked in the description that is where we will be live streaming the wedding ceremony live for you guys on october 4th so be sure to join in it'll be at 4pm mountain standard time and all the details will be on that channel if you haven't seen the video of us inviting you to our wedding definitely watch that so you guys can understand um the purpose of it and just more details on the exact timing i love you guys so much and i'll see you in my next video bye i need to figure out something else to say besides welcome back to the channel hello everyone it's good to see you um i just wanted to like say hello because i didn't welcome you guys in this video let there be light anyway i just wanted to say hello and welcome to this video i believe this is the last video my last wedding planning video and it's a long one and it's jam-packed but this will probably be my last wedding planning video because i'm getting married in five days and there's just no more planning i can do you feel me but if you guys do have any questions on like i know a few of you asked for like budgeting wedding budgeting tips and stuff like that so i could possibly make like a sit-down video of that after i get married if you are interested but yeah i think this is it for us and the wedding series i think this is it aside from like you know our actual wedding video but that's going to be on the cayenne and kyle channel which is really weird to say the first part of this video it's like the first four minutes or so i'm teaching you guys how i have been planning and the tool i use for organizing and planning everything for the wedding so if you're not interested that skip to this time to get into the rest of the vlog and that's all i have to say to you besides i love you and jesus loves you and i hope you're having a good day   all right so more wedding planning stuff i wanted to show you guys how i have organized all my wedding planning and the tool i use okay so i use this program called millino and i love it because it's like a really creative way to organize everything and it's very visual for someone like me who definitely needs more visuals so they have a free membership but if you're going to store a lot of things i would recommend upgrading i think it's like you can find a discount code somewhere maybe i have one if i do i'll put it in the description but i found a discount code that gives this gives this program to me for like eight dollars a month and it's definitely worth it so this is what my wedding board looks like so i have all of these different tabs this is kind of how you do it you pull over like a column and then you would name it like decor or whatever and then in that you can add notes you can add to do's add images comments or you can add another board so basically that's what i did throughout all of this so this is kind of like my main home screen and then i added just boards to everything so i have we have our budget over here which honestly i'm just gonna drag to the finances i have our master to-do list so i kind of just wanted somewhere where all of my to-do's are in one spot and we organized it by month so may june july august september is a nice long one final week um i also have like a wedding weekend packing list wedding decor packing list this stuff i'm still working on um and then i also have this list of like all of these items that i needed to buy so these are all the ones like i've ordered i still need to buy like wedding bells lighters zip ties floral foam candles more bases so and you can also go in here and put due dates and assign them to people so up here you can invite people to edit the board so i have my parents my wedding coordinator brittany i have kyle on here kyle's mom so everyone can look at what needs to be done and i can assign them the tasks as well okay so to go back to the main wedding board um i went i did i use this for like my mood board so if you go to the mood this is literally just like a collection of pictures that inspired me um and then i have like a diy board of like things we want to diy i have a florals board of kind of like what this is going to look like and also what is in like the recipes for each bouquet i have my bridesmaids bouquet my bride's bouquet inspiration photos this is like my order from 50 flowers and then i also did a finances tab where i have like kind of everything in one place and then i also have a payment schedule of like when things are due with due dates and i can check them all off which has been very helpful to have that all in one place i have like the honeymoon details the lodging like everybody's airbnb's and i even put on these maps like how far it's gonna be from each place how far it is from the venue i mean you can do so much with with this program in additional to this i've been using zola to do like the guest list and track rsvp's and also been using their table program to put together our seating chart and that has worked great but yeah i just wanted to show you guys kind of how i've been doing it it has been so helpful again this is called mill a note i will leave a link in the description doing a mock-up the best we can of our tables this is actually going to be garland this is kind of a good idea of like the place settings i can even maybe move that here i guess we'll just see how it looks but table runners will be a different color just getting a feel for everything we are now 12 days away from the wedding and i'm just gonna do some wedding updates so i ordered all of these white bells from amazon and now i'm just putting some ribbon on them we don't have glass cups so no one can click the glasses for the like kissing and i love that at weddings so i wanted to have something that people could ring so we're just gonna put two two of these at each table good morning i actually got a little bit ready today this dress i just got in the mail it's from all in favor they sent me a couple of things and they're all really cute so i'm excited to wear this definitely very spring easter um this morning i did a bible study i read through romans 6 and if you are dealing with just overcoming any kind of sin i highly recommend romans 6. it was such a good read this morning if you're not following me on instagram i posted some screenshots of my reading this morning so be sure to follow me there i wanted to show you guys a few things i'm actually going to head out to go to a coffee shop i have to do some work stuff but i wanted to show you my bridesmaids robes that came in look at how beautiful the packaging is i hate it because i have to take it out and i can't leave them like this because i need to steam them all but this is what they look like outside of the packages they're really high quality you can get these customized but i decided not to i really wanted to pick some like high quality robes these ones i think were about 35 or 40 dollars the store they're from is le rose it's an australian company i also got my bridal robe from there but i'm going to leave that a surprise but if you look on your website you can maybe take a guess which one i picked it is really beautiful it's actually a maxi robe anyway so i got those robes in like i said i didn't customize them because i wanted my bridesmaids to be able to wear them again without having like tacky bridesmaid written all over it so i'm really excited for those my wedding coordinator brittany who has been amazing if you need a wedding coordinator in arizona i will have her linked below she's amazing and she recommended to steam as much as you can in advance and also have some extra steamers at the house because that is something that kind of can take a long time that you don't realize so i'm just going to take them all out of the packaging and steam them for all my bridesmaids in advance that way once they get to the venue or the airbnb they're already steamed what else oh my goodness all of our signs from our calligrapher mallory came in let me get some more light in here so mallory was super kind to do all of our signs for us and she has been so amazing to work with she also just started to do sign rentals which is such an amazing idea i believe she's located in arkansas so if you are an arkansas bride definitely reach out to her she can also ship you everything if you're okay to pay shipping she did an amazing job of packing everything and it all arrived safely so let me show you everything she made so like i showed you guys in my previous wedding planning video um we are hanging all of these from one of those copper signs so she did all of our table numbers with people's names that's what's in here there's a ton of them the next thing she made were these table numbers i really like these because they have a slot so we're actually going to put in some pressed flowers around this and she also had all of these made so these just plop in but i thought the pressed flowers would be a really nice touch to kind of spice those up a little bit all right the next thing is our wedding sign and i think this is my favorite thing i love the flowers that are on here and it's a little bit like foggy right now but that's because there's still like a plastic backing on here which will be taken off so once it's taken off it'll be super clear and yeah this is what the copper sign looks like and then i'm hoping to just put like a floral arrangement right here i still need to spray paint these just to match a little better she also did this mr and mrs wolfgang sign which is super cute we're probably gonna have this on a sweetheart table i did have to put a little stickies in here because it was a little bit loose but yeah we're gonna have this on our sweetheart table but it might be a little too big um so we also can put it like on our welcome table i don't know if i mentioned this but i needed some aisle decor at first i was thinking to like lay down garland at the edge of all the benches i know a lot of people like do lanterns that's not really my style so i kind of wanted some other decor for the aisle caps so we're gonna put these like vases of dried flowers at um the ends of the aisle so like this will be on one side with probably this thing and then these will be on the other side so i do need to buy one more vase but i did want to show you where i got some of these dried flowers those ones i got it at home and i spray painted these ones that were actually from my balloon arrangement of my bachelorette party so i'm not sure where they got those but i actually ordered these on a website called a floral and i have some more of them here and a floral has actually pretty good prices for this kind of stuff i also got some pompous grass they had a sale um but basically i paid like 20 dollars for just that little bunch and these were so much cheaper on their website so i would definitely recommend them oh i also ordered these from a floral right here they're like fake dried palms but they look honestly really real so i got two of these so i do need to buy another vase to put them in and then my order from 50 flowers came in they sent the dried stuff early so if you are looking for a bunch of dried decor and you want it in bulk like if you have a boutique maybe i would highly recommend them these are white bunny tails i believe and there's a bunch of those so i can put a bunch in like one of those as well that is my wedding update for now i'm gonna head to a coffee shop um i'm actually trying out a video editor so i thought that would be really nice since we started a channel with kyle so i'm actually gonna go sit down and review the video they edited just to see if i like their work and make corrections and stuff i also need to plan out some social media posts for my one client which exciting news for me is i am officially going completely full time on youtube and this is my last month working for them and working for anyone else so that is really exciting for me because that does take up some of my like mental and creative space so i'm excited to just completely be working for myself that is such a blessing and i am so grateful for it so i just really need to finish up some stuff for them because in october i'm going to train whoever they hire next but i do need to schedule out a bunch of stuff because i will be pretty mia in october for the wedding and the honeymoon     good morning oh i'm a little tired i don't know if you can tell but i didn't sleep that great last night but there is so much wedding stuff so many wedding updates i hope you guys aren't annoyed with all of this wedding content because i just feel like that is my life right now but um we are now 10 days away from the wedding which is crazy that sounds like a lot but then i'm like okay this sunday it will be my wedding week and that makes it kind of crazy but i wanted to show you guys some things that came in so let me give you some updates so i ordered these press flowers from amazon and i already used this pack of them i or actually ordered some more that are probably in the mail right now that are being delivered today and basically i've just been putting them in the table numbers this one i kind of messed up and got some super glue i shouldn't probably be using super glue but i'm hoping i can get that off this is what they're gonna look like i'll probably go back in and add more flowers since i have a ton more um this one's cute but yeah i thought it was like a nice way to dress these up oh man that's pretty bad dang hopefully that comes off another update is our wedding favor so kyle's parents just got into town and for wedding favors we decided to use honey and kyle's mom works for this amazing honey company and he makes it like organic and fresh and it's so so good i will leave the website in the description if you are interested in some really good flavored honey but i really wanted to do that as a wedding favor so there's like these little mini sample boxes i'll just show you she's been working on them and she just brought all of these over for us this is what they look like and we just bought these little k's they're just like stickers and some ribbon off of etsy and then the flavor sticker is on the bottom this one is blueberry so these will be everyone's take home gifts and i'm kind of hoping that some people don't take them because i would love some of these and then also the owner was really kind and made us literally these huge jars for our wedding this one um has our like wedding date on it this one's chocolate it's so good but then look this one is huge this one is pumpkin spice honey i kind of stopped filming i've been so tired all day but some updates i went to the mailbox and picked up a bunch of packages that came in the first one is this diamond dazzler stick so i haven't been able to get my ring professionally cleaned and it was just looking pretty grimy and definitely not as sparkly as i remember it and i just used this stick i got it from amazon i'll have it linked in the description and basically you just like twist it up and then rub it all over the diamond and then you brush the diamond and then rinse it off and it really works well honestly like before you probably can't tell it is very sparkly like completely clear so i definitely would recommend that if you're looking for a ring cleaner some other things that came in the mail were more preserved flowers so i'm gonna put those in the signs um i also got the table runners this is the color they looked a little like pinky but i think i think they'll be good the color i got was called latte and i'll have it linked below but man these look a lot better than the ones i attempted to make and i think they'll look really nice on the table so those all came in also kyle's parents brought his nintendo 64 and we really want to play it so we had to order some things to convert it so we actually found this thing and you can plug in the nintendo 64 cables and then i got it hdmi to a usbc so i can plug this into the projector that we have hey just letting them know about our new nintendo setup um so hopefully now we'll be able to use the nintendo 64 on our projector or on like any kind of um tv you excited and 64. our lives are officially over yeah seriously   so hello it is a new day i have no idea what's happening in this vlog i'm literally eight days out from the wedding and life is a little hectic this apartment is a disaster i'll show you in a second but i quickly wanted to do a little target at home goods haul i went to look for some faces because i need at least one more for wedding decor and it's great because i can just use it as apartment decorations afterwards so i wanted to show you what i found but of course when you go to target you don't leave with just one thing so i'm gonna do a quick little haul and then something really exciting kyle went to go pick up a coffee table from offer up he got it for fifty dollars really good deal um and then i found a chair at target for the bedroom and i love it it's so cozy and we need to go pick it up because it didn't fit in my car so we'll show you that later but for now let me show you what i got found this wooden vase i thought it was a little strange that the hole went all the way through but i think that will look really nice in the house somewhere this one was from target and then i've been seeing these on instagram also milena has these and i've always wondered what they are and i couldn't find any similar online i'm sure honestly etsy probably has some but anyway they have these at target so i bought those and then at home goods i found this vase they had a bunch of different colors this was only five dollars which i thought was a really good price for something like that and then i also found this vase i feel like these geometric shapes have been very in right now um and they're just really classic and a little bit more unique so i decided to pick this up i'm not sure if this will actually hold anything or i'll just use it as decoration but this one was 15 which i didn't think was actually a bad price either um and then some other random things um i got some of this elf wow brow i got it in two different colors see which one i like better but i go through that stuff pretty quick and then a brow pencil highly recommend those and then i got some secular water because i ran out i got a couple more things i know these are really big in canada the dressing flavored and they are they're really good so i got a bag of those from home goods and then i also got a few picture frames i thought it would be nice to frame me and kyle's engagement photos and give them to our parents as a wedding like wedding day gift present so i got some frames for those they're just plain wooden frames but let me show you a sneak peek of what the chair will also can we just it looks like we just moved in oh it's horrible we're here i can give you an update basically i was doing these table numbers the seating chart and i decided of course to give myself more work to do and i added some pressed flowers to them obviously the plastic backing needs to come off but these are all going to be hanging right here so i'll show you that when it's done but anyway that's why this place is a mess and i really just need to like recycle stuff and go through and just reorganize all these boxes again but been steaming the bridesmaid robes now here is a sneak peek nice dirty sock so this is the material that the couch is made of it's like a sherpa material i'm really hoping that it doesn't become annoying and like shed a lot but i don't know it seems fine um and then this ottoman was sold separately but really what i want this corner to be is like a cozy corner to do like my morning devotional in so i thought having the ottoman would be nice um but i can always return it if it doesn't work out but this is what it's made of now that i'm looking at this corner i don't think this is going to be a big enough corner maybe if i angle it i might have to shift like the bed and stuff over a little bit but yeah this corner was pretty empty so it definitely needed something and i think the chair will be nice and then i can hide all the cords and stuff so i'm really excited for that to get here and the coffee table it's been a little bit since i just filmed but a lot has happened brittany my wedding coordinator came over she is seriously such a blessing i don't know how i would do this all without her she came and helped me organize everything in the living room i'm going to show you it also the couch or the little chair is here so i wanted to show you that too this is the cozy corner let me know what you guys think i was thinking maybe i needed to move the bed over a little bit however the headboards attached to the wall so that would take a little bit of work i i don't know let me know if you think it's a little too crowded over here and if we should shift everything a little bit this is how much room is on the other side but i think it looks really cozy and this chair is really comfortable and an update on the living room still have to do a little bit more cleaning up but everything is organized again i put together a bunch of new arrangements with the new vases that i got lots of bunny tails and palms that one has those little dragon flowers i don't know if those that's i don't think that's what they're called at all but that's what they remind me of so what's with the sass what you can do whatever you want i'm not being sad it's fine you can sit on the couch while i'm filming i'm just vlogging this is a lot of sense i'm sorry if there was something remember okay you want me to move you can sit there did not sound like that that was sassy man sassy makes sass cakes out here i love you i love you are you sure yeah okay all right well anyway i forgot what what did i need to show you guys it's a new day we are now five days out from the wedding and i'll probably edit this after this clip so anyway i just wanted to fill you guys in on some new exciting things around the house but i can't remember what i've shown you so i'm just gonna show it to you all and then i'll just cut out whatever i've already shown you so i don't know did we tell them about the coffee table i don't believe i have so me and kyle just filmed a video juicy's all set up but we found this coffee table well kyle found this coffee table on offer up for he got it for fifty dollars and it is really beautiful it reminds me a lot of the ones that they charge like four hundred dollars for everywhere else i think what i do want to do is stain this um a little bit more like of a rich color it just looks a little dull and i feel like that would really bring it to life a little bit more but other than that i think it's really nice with our couch but you see how that's just like super rich and it kind of like brings it to life i probably won't go that dark but just i feel like it needs a little life in it um and then the reason why it was probably so cheap is because there's this big crack in the glass so we need to figure out or buy another piece of glass to put on top of it well it's officially super glued so yeah one piece it just doesn't look the best and i'm gonna get car windshield fillers and i'm going to try to fill it to see if it would like bring it together and like be less visible yeah eventually we would get new glass yeah i would like to get new glass because this one is like has this green color which i don't like a piece of glass this big is like 150 bucks hence why the table is only 50 bucks otherwise it's a 200 table if you have any ideas on where to get glass for cheap or any other solutions let us know but anyway okay is what we need um yeah so that's a nice update um we got our nespresso machine so i'm so excited we got our nespresso machine in it is very beautiful it was on our registry um if you let me know you guys favorite nespresso because we've been trying some and i'm so obsessed with it already i made a latte this morning so nice 50 flowers sent me this bouquet just as like a congratulations for the wedding week it's so pretty if you guys lost or if you guys saw my last video you know i am partnering with them for the wedding flowers so this was just a really sweet surprise that they sent me all right everybody i hope you enjoyed this vlog i tried to vlog as much as i could i had like a solid week or two where i didn't really vlog at all but i tried to vlog the last few days just so you can kind of see what my life has been like in the middle of wedding stuff and we're so excited we are officially five days away um it is the tuesday before our wedding and yeah we're really really excited and probably the next thing you'll see on this channel is i have no idea i don't know a video a video yeah because we're probably gonna

think this is my last day that my period should be affecting me and then tomorrow i should be a happy camper go lucky could you imagine at the peak of your period getting married that's why i'm pretty sure when we selected a date for our wedding i i chose a date that we wouldn't i wouldn't have my period but we really we got close to the line it was risky i made sure to check my calendar to make sure that i would not be on my period on mostly the wedding day and then obviously i didn't really want to be on it on the honeymoon which i'm not going to be but it worked out that i'm on my period a week before the wedding which might just be as bad because i'm so cranky and stressed but but kyle loves me and jesus loves me so we're fine and you guys you guys love her too right drop it in the

wow wow oh my goodness kyle just called me and i said you called me and then he facetimed me and i said it's bad luck to see the bride on your wedding day and he said i don't believe in luck so then we just had a facetime but i'm pretty sure the reason he called was he was trying to surprise me with a coffee because he ordered coffee to the apartment to be delivered and he just wanted to make sure i would be here so he was trying to talk me into not getting coffee and i was like no i need coffee i need to go get coffee like i want coffee i feel bad i ruin all his surprises all right but i should get ready i need to shower and i'm gonna put some essential oils in my shower like peppermint to help wake me up oh look at the beautiful light the sun is rising they say if you just like look

this is probably the greatest day of my life until we have kids ah it is a great day in my life i'm so excited yay only one more hour one more hour we're almost there you feeling behind the scenes i feel bad because it's so hot outside so hot you look great just chilling i love this underpiece you've added yeah i feel like this might work very modest   so   bye     in west philadelphia born and raised on the playground most of my days chilling out nights and relaxing all cool   squad   it is now two days after our wedding yesterday we were both so exhausted today we're still exhausted i feel good because i had a nice long nap yesterday yeah you got some extra resting why didn't why didn't i get dressed because we came back from the resort and we were gonna take a nap we were both exhausted and then i left my wedding dress in the hotel room closet and i mean the hotel was pretty close it was like an hour away so so kyle drove an hour back to get it because he is the best guy in the world oh man and he you can tell he's not bitter about it at all no not at all i'd do anything for you baby god's like hey you're married let's see how committed you are it's like test after test so yeah it's two days after our wedding and now we are headed as you see we have our wedding attire we are headed up to um horseshoe band flagstaff um we're meeting our photographers up there because we're taking some epic epic epic photos epic photos in our wedding stuff i'm excited because on my wedding day on our wedding day it was so hot it was 105 degrees and i was so sweaty like all my hair kind of like fell out i did not feel or look my best i felt like by the time we were taking pictures i was so sweaty so i feel like i should have brought at least three or four different white button ups now we're gonna go up and take photos in like 85 degree weather i feel like my hair is going to look a lot better so i'm excited that we are going because i don't i feel prettier today than i did on the wedding day because i was so sweaty first off i've never ever ever seen as much beauty as i did on a wedding day baby you are just so gorgeous i mean you're beautiful all the time but like you in that dress and that moment in that place with with god just all around good girl i was just it was amazing thank you however yeah today is going to be nice because we're not going to be sweating like pigs yeah and we're not on a time crunch no rush we're gonna stay one night up in page arizona which is right near horseshoe bend because we get to spend the night together now which hasn't been like uh i'm sure we'll do a whole video on other stuff but i will just say it's it's a struggle trying to adjust sleeping with somebody else do you think it's gonna be like this glorious thing where you're both just in heaven and like so comfy but i mean it's pretty gorgeous we've been tossing and turning we haven't gotten yeah you have to just sleeping with somebody yeah i wake up i see you i want to cuddle you oh we cuddle in the beginning and then yeah you get hot and my shoulder starts to cramp up and hurt so we fall asleep we both wake up more comfortable we shift we move typically one shifts moves that wakes up the other one then the other one realizes how uncomfortable they are and then we fall asleep and then i typically wake back up and realize i'm not cuddling you so i roll over i grab you back on and then it's a rinse and repeat yeah at least that's how it's been so hopefully that changes yeah i'm sure we'll adjust yeah does that look like that here is the look check it check it and there's currently a hurricane heading for our honeymoon spot hurricane delta is apparently heading straight towards cancun it they say it's supposed to hit tonight or maybe tomorrow and we're supposed to leave thursday which is not tomorrow but the next day so we're praying for that yes we are praying this hurricane away in jesus name yeah so basically like our flights couldn't get cancelled or like the resorts could shut down or i mean just the weather could be absolutely horrible so i don't even know if we really have a backup plan i um luckily we have a travel agent so our travel agent said she is modern monitoring everything for us she has someone on the ground in cancun who's giving her updates and she's monitoring our flights for us which is such a blessing so if you guys need i mean travel agents are free they just work on commission from what you book so i would highly recommend her i'll leave her link in the description but that has been really nice that we you know obviously we're just trying not to worry or stress about it but it makes it a lot easier when we have someone else who's taking care of it all and watching it for us and if we do need to make changes she will be in charge it's kind of like a wedding planner but a honeymoon honeymoon yeah it's great it is great okay well we're just gonna keep driving we'll check in with you when we get up north we made it to our first shooting location we found these like red rock um on the side of the highway we parked right over here got into our wedding gear you're not supposed to show them because

gotta go hello everybody my name is cayenne if you haven't been here before i am so excited to be back filming videos this is the first official video i've sat down and filmed since the honeymoon so i'm really excited it's sad to say that i miss work because i did but that's just a testament to how much i love doing videos and content creation and all that stuff i am so excited for today's video i just decided to sit down and do a wedding q a kyle and i filmed a more in-depth wedding q a more so about the experience of the wedding um from both sides and that is on our couple's channel so if you guys want to watch that i'll have it linked here but i wanted to do another wedding q a more geared towards brides and wedding planning since i documented a lot of my wedding planning experience on this channel so yeah that is what today's video is about i wanted to say a big thank you to today's sponsor which is chemistry and i am so excited because they are a christian brand and any opportunity that i get to incorporate christian brands or companies or small businesses into my channel i definitely want to do so it's so exciting that i get to partner with a christian company and they are a christian apparel company they were kind enough to send me some of their shirts so i'll have those all inserted now   if you guys are interested in any of their shirts i love that they have a big cross on them they just display the gospel of jesus i love wearing shirts like this out in public or when kyle ever wears a shirt like this out in public it just provokes conversation between strangers and i see it all the time so if you're looking for some christian apparel highly recommend them all of the shirts are very comfortable and soft and you can use the code cayenne tea for a 10 discount on your order so thank you again to chemistry for sponsoring this video and let's get into the questions i asked you guys on instagram to send in your questions if you're not following me there i will have it right here and who knows i don't know i am in the process of hardcore debating if i should change my instagram handle i believe i'm going to it's just it's kind of hard to part with your last name i don't know okay first question how does it feel to know you get to have a lifelong sleepover with your best friend and it is so amazing being able to sleep in the same bed as kyle he never has to leave at night and it's it's amazing to wake up with him and just having like no boundaries and anything and we just get to completely be ourselves and free and it's great i will say that adjusting to sleeping with someone has been hard so there's been a lot of tossing and turning and we're definitely adjusting um i'm not used to sleeping with somebody so we both are like waking up a lot while we're sleeping so please pray for our rest i know i'll get used to it we'll both get used to it eventually but amanda asked what was the most stressful thing about wedding planning uh i tried not to be stressed throughout the planning i think the most stressful part was probably the last month because that's when i realized i had so many little things that i hadn't done yet or forgot to order so there was a few days where i just realized like oh my goodness i have so much to do and i started getting a little stressed i think another thing that's stressful about wedding planning is your fiance doesn't understand what you're going through and that can be a stressor on the relationship is you know obviously most brides take control of planning the entire entire wedding and they care more about what the wedding looks like kyle didn't really care what it looked like he just wanted to get married and he didn't really have the creative eye that i did for like the vision of the wedding so he handed that over to me and he was trying his best to support me throughout the process but at the end of the day they just do not get it and they don't understand so some really good advice that my wedding planner gave me was don't expect your fiance to understand what it's like on your side if you want to vent or rant about wedding stuff ask somebody or talk to somebody a former bride who was who has been married because she will understand you way more than your fiance ever will so i would say that was probably the most stressful part someone asked did your bridesmaid do their own hair and makeup or did someone else do it i gave my bridesmaid an option if they wanted me to hire somebody and bring someone in for makeup and hair but everyone ended up opting to do their own and then one of my friends justine helped a lot of the bridesmaids and like my mom and help them with their makeup as well someone asked how to handle bridesmaid wars when one thinks they deserve to be a bridesmaid or a man of honor i was very blessed that i didn't really have a much bridesmaid drama i actually decided not to have a maid of honor and probably for this exact thing i didn't want anyone to feel like entitled or feel like one person deserved it more than the other so i just decided not to have a maid of honor and all i did was send out a text asking what people's strengths were what they were interested in planning and then delegated everything to everyone instead of having one main person in charge and that worked really well for me morgan asked were you nervous for the wedding or did you feel peace all day it was crazy i was not nervous at all i was in complete peace i was so relaxed and chill i was just chilling i didn't even feel nervous walking down the aisle i didn't feel nervous saying our vows or talking in front of people so that was really cool this person asked to stay anonymous and she asked which one is better a small or a big wedding we ended up having about like 85 people we ended we invited 170 and i'm glad that it dwindled down um to 85 i think that was a really good number i would it really just depends what you want um and how much money you want to spend smaller weddings are obviously great if you want something more intimate and you want to save money however i know i wanted enough people there for it to feel like a party and we wanted the big experience and the dance floor and the big dinner and all that stuff so we ended up wanting to stay at about 100 people and ended up with about 80 or so somebody asked what would you do differently if you could do it all again um i answered this a little bit in our other q a but i'm going to talk more about the planning side of it as a bride i would definitely not diy as much as i did because some of the diys didn't even save me that much money one in particular i would probably not try to diy the napkins and table runners i ended up ordering table runners because after trying to diy the napkins i was like this sucks and i think i could have it could have been a lot easier if i tried to wash dye but i tried to like hand dye all of our napkins and it was so miserable so i would definitely do that differently because i didn't end up saving any money and i definitely wasted a bunch of time so i would say that just not diy some things i probably would have delegated more to my bridesmaids it was just it was hard i probably would have invited people over more to help help me with things and doing decor stuff um i did a decent amount but i probably could have delegated even more i would have had more people help my coordinator set up the setup ended up taking way longer than expected and so when we arrived at the venue to start doing a couple pictures um it still wasn't done yet which i was fine i wasn't stressed about it i knew she would execute it however it was so hot outside that they were getting heat exhaustion so i would have just sent more people over the venue to help them set up and probably had the rentals get there a lot earlier they got there at 11 and apparently it took them four hours to unload the rentals and it was just the tables and the benches so i would have them there a lot earlier even in the morning so they could you know it could be a little bit cooler but yeah i would do all of those things differently if i can think of anything else i'll let you guys know someone asked where my bridesmaid dresses were and they are from a company called baltic born and i'll have them linked in the description how could others have been more helpful to you in the wedding planning season that is a great question i will brag on my bridesmaids right now and one thing i will say is have bridesmaids who are selfless and caring and helpful because i had a few bridesmaids on my wedding day who were constantly asking if i need anything and they were just so helpful it was amazing to have people on my wedding day who just were so serving and had servants hearts they were constantly asking if i needed anything i was like hey i need this place cleaned out and like 30 seconds later all of them would go clean things out and i don't everything everyone was so amazing and supportive so if you are a bridesmaids i would just constantly be asking the bride what they need help with if they need water and all those things and love the bride like jesus because she needs it people just reaching out to the bride is a huge thing just texting her throughout the planning process asking her for any if she needs anything is so helpful because a lot of times the bride doesn't really feel um like the bride doesn't feel like she needs to text people for help she would rather people ask an offer um i guess it all depends a bride too somebody asked did you feel lost once the wedding is over going from so much to plan to do it over and then be done with oh my goodness yes i i think this was the one thing i did not expect at all leading up to the wedding i was so excited for planning to be over and that's what i kept saying i was like i'm so excited for this to be over it's gonna be so nice i'm gonna have so much mental space and then the wedding happened and then i would say the first two days of our honeymoon i was like in shock i was just like feeling so blessed and it was just so crazy going from super busy planning 24 7 having this huge thing to look forward to to then being on a honeymoon where we're just supposed to relax and do nothing and stay off our phones and all this stuff i felt like so not myself and especially just going to like a very relaxing thing for nine days i was going crazy so that's why i say it's so good to be back working because it just feels more energizing i don't know it's so hard to explain if you guys have experienced this let me know but that's definitely not something i was expecting so yeah and especially because i could completely like check out of work while i was away i don't know it's just so weird um someone asked if it was awkward when kyle was dancing on you in front of everyone you know so if you guys don't know what she's referring to uh kyle did a very um expressive garter dance and i wasn't expecting it at all uh i'll insert a couple of clips when he was like joking about it oh no no okay so he's like yeah we're gonna call it all the guys out for the carter calls and then you sit down or you're already sitting down i think you're already sitting down and then when he says we're gonna call the guys out all the guys are kind of like uh i don't know and then you just see me like and then who let the dogs out and then all the other guys were like oh okay and then they're going to come up and it's like ooh let the dogs down just like oh and then and then once the guys go out and it does like who let the dogs out like three times stop it then then it's just like it stops and goes when i get that feeling i'm like sexually healing yeah and then we just go into it i'm just saying you're enjoying this what do you think it's a great idea at first he didn't even want to do a garter dance because he didn't want to like do that in front of everybody but i showed him a few videos of other christian couples who had done it in like a tasteful and like very cute and flirty way and so he decided to do it and then all of a sudden at the wedding he was just like outrageous and going in like giving me a lap dance and all this stuff but i thought it was really funny and cute i wasn't embarrassed at all i don't know how everyone else felt but i thought it was so funny and i thought i mean of our whole wedding that was like the sexiest part and because we waited till marriage i thought that was just like a fun thing to do but obviously everyone teach their own i know a lot of people who aren't comfortable with that but you guys know me and if you know me you know i don't get embarrassed easily and i just thought it was really awesome somebody asked things you would need that you wouldn't think about so this is like the weirdest advice i will give you and it's the weirdest advice that i've heard but my wedding coordinator told me to wear a tampon on the wedding day because down there sweats a lot and i was like uh okay but i actually did it and i will say i would recommend it because it definitely helped with the sweating somebody asked what was your budget how did you know how much you were comfortable spending so i actually asked my dad for help with this that was something in the beginning that was very stressful that i forgot about was the budgeting thing back in the day kyle was not comfortable talking about finances and it was a stronghold in his life so that made it especially hard but we worked through that and i my dad is very good with numbers so i asked him for his help first you need to figure out how much time you need to spend and how much you want to spend we looked at our income which if you've heard of dave ramsey i would highly recommend doing that and starting budgeting and starting using the every dollar app that was very helpful for us so we decided about twenty thousand dollars so once you decide on a number you have to look at your income and all of your expenses and decide um how long do you need to save that much money do you have anything saved okay great you have this much saved now we need to save x amount over the next whatever until our wedding so then from there you start doing math dividing it up and and really see like okay we make enough money to be saving a thousand dollars a month for the wedding or 2 000 a month for the wedding and then you just calculate it out and decide okay this is what we want to spend and this is how much we can save each month so doing the math how many months do we need to save up so for us we needed i think six to eight months to save that money so that's what we did and we just budgeted in to our every dollar app wedding savings every month do take into account that some vendors can be paid after the wedding um usually it's only your videographer and photographer because they get paid some get paid the day of the wedding but some don't get paid till the photos and video are completed so that was something that helped us is we didn't owe the videographer until after the wedding um but those are all things to take into account and yeah once you figure out your number yeah you just start saving what is one thing you felt like you was a waste of money that's a good question i feel like i didn't really go all out on things like we didn't have like a photo booth or any of those things we got almost all of our vendors for a really good price so i honestly don't think anything was a waste of money i would save anything it was the napkins that i diy myself i should have just gone with the caterers napkins that were free i think that was probably the biggest waste of money but other than that i think everything was worth it my wedding planner's name was brittany she works for a company called bridal stitch she started it herself so i will have her linked below someone asked the name of the wedding planner um highly recommend her funny story is i think i mentioned it she got heat exhaustion or heat stroke i'm not sure the correct term honestly this actually isn't funny but just to go like to show you how amazing she is she literally had heat stroke from setting up was throwing up and came right back and finished and executed the whole entire wedding so she's committed and she's a soldier and she's amazing so someone said i just got engaged what do i do now lol oh my goodness yes i've been there so i think the first thing you should do is do i want to start wedding planning now or do i want a couple of months so i started to wedding plan even before i was engaged because our timeline was shorter and it was just so stressful and it was just too much for me so basically i decided to take like a month or two months after we're engaged and just not do any wedding planning um besides dress shopping um so if you're engaged i would first decide if you need some time before you even think about planning if you just need a couple months to adjust to this new idea of being engaged and getting married or if you want to dive in i would say get your dress your venue because that way you can set your date and your budget i would say those are the three big things and then next would be your videographer and photographer those are the five things that you should get done after you get engaged i would say i mean it really just depends how soon you're getting married but those are the things that go the fastest and are the most important and that take the longest so someone going along with that said what vendors do you think you need to prioritize the most um i would say the venue videographer photographer um and yeah i don't know when it comes to catering we actually found somebody on the app thumbtack because catering was a big cost none of the big caterers could do it in our budget so we actually found someone on thumbtack which i was definitely iffy about but he ended up being amazing and he went above and beyond and it was a flat rate which was awesome because a lot of the other catering companies charge you per plate like per utensil per napkin like it's all extras per person but he just agreed on a flat rate for how many guests we had and yeah that was really awesome i would also say to prioritize a day of wedding coordinator i could not have done it without it you just there's so many things you don't think about on your wedding day and you don't want to think about or worry about like who's setting up who's cleaning up who's packing everything up who's getting this where all of these things who is um being in communication with all the vendors all of that stuff there's so much to think about that you don't even realize so i would definitely prioritize hiring a day of coordinator at least at the minimum somebody asked if we were exhausted the night of the wedding um we actually kept our energy up until after all the fun stuff if you know what i'm talking about and then we were so exhausted and then we were exhausted the next day and the day after that we were exhausted for a solid two days after the wedding all right everybody that is all the questions i'm answering in today's video i hope you guys enjoyed um i can continue to do some wedding stuff but i obviously don't want to flood you guys with too much wedding stuff because that that's really all i've been posting lately but a few of you guys did ask for more of an in-depth in to budgeting and budgeting tips so if you guys are interested in that let me know i also do have footage from when i first found my wedding dress when it came in the mail um alterations and stuff like that so if you guys are interested in seeing all of that footage i might insert that in like a future vlog or another wedding related video so anyway i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you liked it please give it a thumbs up and let me know in the comments thank you so much for all your prayers well wishes and congratulations i appreciate you guys so much and i am so excited to be back spending time with you and just dedicating more time to this channel and you guys and talking to you guys so thank you so much for all your support i love you and jesus loves you and i hope you guys have an amazing week hello everybody welcome to today's vlog say hello to the friends what's up it's 12. kyle and i woke up this morning and had our bible time we read through hebrews 11. which is so good yeah it's really good all about faith um and then we had some breakfast and now we're kind of transitioning into the work day it's a little bit of a later start we're trying to get up earlier and get through things so i'm gonna clean up the house a little bit just i'm gonna make the bed and maybe like clean up the table and stuff   okay i cleaned up the house now i am going to sit down and do some work i was looking at essential oils that helped me focus and apparently rosemary which is very surprising to me is supposed to really help with focus so i think i'm going to apply it with some coconut oil like maybe on my temples or i might just diffuse it this diffuser is from target i don't think they sell it anymore unfortunately but i like it basically the biggest part of our apartment that we haven't finished is this area here where like the tv would go and a media console right now it's just a bunch of wedding things that i'm trying to sell but i have been looking for a media console and all the ones that i like are like a thousand dollars but we don't want to spend that much um so i've been looking at like ikea hacks for them so i was gonna attempt to do this one and i was pretty set on it it's made of the ivar ikea cabinets and then they just cut out half circles and put cane behind it i was watching abigail's instagram stories and she kind of posted a hack without even knowing it um using the eye of our cabinets and these other like doors so they're not a perfect fit you do have to trim some off but anyway once i saw her post that i literally was i was like you know what that looks great i would be happy with that and everything total was about 250 to 280 with tax which is pretty affordable for a media console that looks like that so we went to ikea last night got all the supplies and brought them home and now kyle is going to build them right more work for me we're gonna build them together yeah um but like i said the doors are just a little bit too big um for the eye bar cabinets they weren't like created for this part of them so we do need to get part of the door trimmed off so kyle's going to take them to home depot to see if they will allow us to use the cutting tools or cut them for us otherwise we need to buy circular saw yeah otherwise we need to get our own saw which i mean kyle does enough projects where i need to get one anyway yeah these are the doors so it comes in packs of two so we got two packs of two and then two of the ivar cabinets um but basically these weren't exactly designed for our cabinets they're a little bit too big so what abigail did was she had this part cut off um so that they would fit you know more flush against each other because right now they both have these lips on them and it's made for a different set yeah so we're thinking as long as we can get this cut off then it should be a good fit   so kyle put it together so those are the doors which we won't be using and we're just trying to figure out for these what we need to kind of like trim off so basically this is what we were talking about the dilemma is when you buy these doors it's not a perfect fit can you put it up honey so it looks like that so what we're thinking is if we trim off shave the lips shave these off then it'll be a better fit yep i think i need to like put it together to see exactly where it sits okay and then maybe you can make a marking with like a pencil or something to see how much exactly we need to take off chose the 20 inch depth i believe there is a 12 inch depth so you can get the cabinet a little bit less wide we decided to go with this length just because we do have quite a bit of space here and just the more storage the better yes i'm currently at home default kyle's trying to get those things cut and i'm looking for hardware potentially i just thought getting some hardware would kind of elevate the look of it so let's see what they have i really like these ones kind of like this as well i think maybe like this or even just like a small pole this one's kind of cute too and then they have some like more a little bit more bright of a gold down here i think i like these i think that looks really nice or just these we ended up going to the thrift store because we had to return some things i found this vase i saw a similar one to this at ikea and it was 15 and i was like i don't want to pay 15 for a vase but i'm just gonna paint it and then i found this face and i also really love like the shape of this one it's a little bit more unique i think it actually would look really nice on the media stand i don't love the color so i'll probably paint this as well so home depot cuts like bigger wood they cut like two by fours four by fours you know all that they cut plywood and um panels and stuff like that they have a panel color cutter but they don't have something that's like made to cut something as fragile as this and the guy was like dude like i'll cut it for you but you know i'm not liable it's your decision it's your choice it could it's literally called the rip is the cutter and he's like it could just completely rip it apart so um you know being that i don't have a table saw which is what i would recommend for a job like this so we took a shot and it worked but now it's all like a little jagged and also i gotta do a little bit of sanding so what i would probably recommend to anyone who wants to try this ikea hack is to just hire like a task rabbit or if you have a friend or family member who is good with construction to just have them solve the pieces for you or yeah if you don't know anybody you can hire a taskrabbit i have a 10 referral code in the description so you'll get 10 off your first task but basically people just go on there who are good with their hands and you can just hire someone to assemble the furniture and have them fix the door and i don't know it would probably cost like i don't i want to say like 40 dollars depending where you live and with the coupon or with the link you can get 10 off so i don't know like 30 bucks 40 bucks to have someone put everything together fix the door for you probably will be worth it so that is what i would recommend obviously i have an amazing husband kyle and he's figuring it out for us but if you don't have that try that way good morning it is the next day look what we got set up i'm going to show you in a little bit but just woke up and the only way to get kyle out of bed is to leave the bed so i've been on alarm duty so i put the alarm in the living room so that it forces me to get out of bed and then i just don't go back in bed sometimes i'll like get in the shower and it forces kyle to get up so we'll see how long it we'll see how long it takes us that's so cozy we're trying this new oat milk by planet oh it is the extra creamy i should probably try it on its own that's pretty good that's really good i don't think they'll be able to see hi guys look at my hair you always wake up with the funniest hairstyle yeah and that work of art oh yeah it's abstract i've been doing these abstract pieces lately yeah it's so talented all right just finished up bible time and before that we actually had a meeting with a potential accountant all the fun adulting stuff but they actually specialize in influencer taxes so if you're looking for an accountant i'll have them linked below she's a believer the owners are believers so that's awesome and we just got a package and look what it is hello friends it is our hello fresh it's heavy i'm gonna have to put you guys down hello french this is not sponsored however i was releasing should be sponsored i was really intimidated to start cooking again uh once we got married but i was also tired of eating out so i mean not even tired of eating out i couldn't i would have kept being out outside of spending money on eating out so i decided to get the hellofresh because also grocery shopping and meal planning it's all kind of a lot so we decided to do hello fresh just to like build up our cooking skills and get some recipe ideas so we're on our second box i posted about on instagram so last night we finished setting this up and i also did a couple art projects so those vases that i got from goodwill i ended up painting them basically just get paint mix it with baking soda baking powder and it kind of gives it a chalky ceramic look so i painted both of them we have this one which i'm trying to debate if i should add on another layer i did some cracked pepper on it to give it some more texture and also like kind of like a little bit of these black dots i think this one turned out pretty good okay this is what they look like they are so beautiful one thing we did decide to do is put these um a little bit higher so he installed the doors higher that way they wouldn't drag on the carpet and we wouldn't have to put any legs on here um but it does leave this little kind of like lip up top which we don't really mind still think it looks amazing i am still debating if i want to put these handles on i feel like it would kind of make it look a little bit more expensive but kyle kind of likes the simplicity of it so anyway this is the styling i have done so far just have these books over here this is a vase that we did i did that painting method with um this candle holder is from ikea got some books i thrifted this book i just really liked kind of like the the color and texture of it and then over here i'm still figuring it out i'm like swapping out this wood piece but i feel like the wood kind of clashes so this is what i have right now um yeah i think i'm gonna go on pinterest and get some more inspiration i repotted lulu which i don't know if i've introduced lulu to the vlog but this is lulu she has a majesty palm and she's so beautiful and sweet she's a sweet girl right you're so sweet but i was thinking are you laughing at me yeah i was thinking this might be since it's really like big and an interesting shape might be a cool instead of having this or even swapping out that i don't know i need to figure it out let's see oh i like where this is heading but i might swap this white one out let's try this that's kind of cool i don't know i'm gonna play around with it maybe i'll ask you guys on instagram and have you guys vote on which styling you guys like the best also what do you guys think i want to get rid of this side table i just think it's it's kind of random but i have no idea what to put here i was thinking maybe some kind of bookcase or a lamp maybe no idea so if you have any suggestions for this area let me know i have all of these wires hanging out and they look so bad so i'm going to use one of the clips clue betty dupes and see what i can do so first one's done i'll just show you how easy it is you just want to pull all of it together wrap it around and then they magnet together now that all the wires are clipped i can just move this back and hide all of the cords and as you can see it looks so much better i literally just thought to do that right now but that fits perfectly with the sponsorship today i absolutely love these products they are simple affordable and just like seriously a really good invention so if you guys are interested in buying any of these i will have them all linked in the description with a discount code so thank you again to kloop for sponsoring this portion of the video and let's get back into it kyle's trying to convince me to give him his birthday present early i'm ready i'm ready to receive you're ready to let this burden go it says to cast your burdens and you will find rest and they talking about cast them on the lord you can cast them on me i'm ready to share your burden i don't think this is sound doctrine i'm ready to share your burdens that's it should i give him his birthday this is bad baby i've been wearing the same hoodie for like three days you have and the same sweatpants that it looks like i haven't changed or showered or anything i mean you haven't changed that's for sure yes i have you've showered this is my no this is my daytime chill outfit but when i go out i change i know i've just been changing to like get myself in the mood to do things i'm ready because i feel like all we do is sit in our pajamas all day sometimes so sometimes dressing up is good for our mental health yeah but uh for me it doesn't make a difference yeah clearly i've been wearing this for fun it's just so cool five vlogs now we're five vlogs deep and you're always in this five videos later we actually film everything on the same exact day just back to back and cayenne just goes and changes real quick so you guys don't know and i just i'm authentic and genuine and transparent i don't think that really hit for me did it hit for you guys probably not being that you're like the most authentic genuine transparent person it doesn't really work oh look at that face love me cookie dinner would you please cook me some dinner that's a little bit better okay make a deal i'll go cook dinner you go get my gift and i'm ready to receive okay fine yeah yeah early birthday present early birthday present time it is time to open up my gift it is time to make a drift out of this i'm ready to receive i'm ready to believe don't you leave my baby baby cooking some dinner for us oh yeah i just wrapped his present i'm still very curious what the heck that is but him opening it might be in a different vlog because we're gonna do a birthday trip to colorado so i'm like maybe i should insert the footage of you opening it in that vlog so i asked you guys on instagram um if you're not following me you can follow me here but i asked you guys what i should do with the media console like how i should style it and also what i should put here um instead of that side table and you guys are giving me some really good ideas so far this is the most votes for the way i should style the media kit midikit media console i'm in youtube collaboration world um the media console and then some suggestions you guys gave you said like it does look too cluttered and awkward here so some of you said just leave the painting or the artwork up and just leave it empty some of you said just put a plant there like a tall plant because that space needs a little bit more height some of you said to do the lamp but basically everyone said to just get rid of that thing so i'm going to take your advice it does look really awkward i feel like it just closes off the living room so maybe i'll start with just removing it completely um and seeing what it looks like but just the painting or the artwork and then from there i can put in like a lamp there oh someone said to put like a little um poof and that it would provide extra seating when people are over and i really like that idea so i thought that would be cute so maybe like a lamp and a poof a lot of you said a a poof is this but you'll have to watch the videos like pointing to there a lot of you guys said to do like a floor-length mirror there however we already have a floor-length mirror in the bedroom so and we also have that mirror there and this mirror behind me so i feel like that might be too many mirrors lots of mirrors so anyway lots of good ideas you'll have to find out in another vlog what i end up doing so i think i'm gonna just end the vlog here we're gonna sit down for dinner and maybe watch like a movie or show or something let me know what vlog content you guys like seeing the most so i can be sure to vlog that in the future thank you guys for hanging out with me if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel i'm a little rusty at this vlog thing thanks   bye all right bye are you still going bye bye that was fun hello everyone welcome back to my channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne and i'm so excited to have you i make videos about lifestyle my faith thrifting and just like everything in between lately i've been making a ton of videos about wedding planning my wedding just passed last month which wait whoa our one month anniversary is in like three days so that's pretty crazy but i'm just gonna keep rolling with the wedding stuff until i just like drain it to its completion because there are still a few more wedding videos that i wanted to make now that i've already been married so today's video is gonna be all about what i have thrifted for our wedding so i'm literally just gonna sit here and show you literally everything that i thrifted for our wedding i didn't see many videos like this on youtube but the ones i did see were helpful to give me ideas the style of our wedding was a little bit more on the boho side however you can use a lot of these things for any kind of style of wedding i just hope that this gives you some ideas for your own wedding or maybe just like an upcoming party and a lot of these things are great transition pieces to decorate our apartment so that's really nice that i get to keep a lot of stuff to use around the apartment so let's just get in to the different categories if you like these kinds of videos be sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel to stick around i'm going to take a sip of this water and just give you like three seconds in case you want to subscribe okay that's all i got for you let's move into the first category okay the first category is picture frames these are kind of obvious but just wanted to show you the ones so i found some of these which were gold and i mean there's so many picture frames at goodwill so you can definitely find things that fit your decor and theme this is actually my favorite one i thrifted i just thought it was really unique and pretty i will say one of my biggest goodwill tips is to subscribe to their newsletter because they send out a monthly 20 off coupon so any purchase 20 or more you can get 20 off and i use coupon multiple times a month so from what i know there's no limit to how many times you can go so sometimes i'll go thrifting like four times a month and use that 20 off coupon and it saves us a ton of money so would highly recommend that the next category of things is vases so i thrifted a ton of different bases and all had its own purpose so i'm going to show you these ones first so ones like this these were actually glass before and i just painted them um this color here kind of gave it like a ceramic look in order to do that you just take paint and mix it with like baking powder and it gives it that chalky look this one's like a little run down so i might have to touch that up but as you can see i use this kind of vase to um put in these like dried flowers these ones are from afloral.com and just going along that theme i have one like this which is white i found this one which is a really cute shape and like i said all of these can be used after your wedding to decorate here is another vase that i painted and i just put these dried bunny tails in it so definitely recommend thrifting some vases here is another vase that i really love and i actually use this as you can see to put all of our sparklers in for the sparkler exit i also wanted to show you um some bases that you could thrift for more so the tables i think having vases on the tables just with like a little tiny dry flowers or for example like something like this in the vase we also used like these kind of dried flowers in them so i think just having really small dainty vases throughout your tables can really add some more dimension to the decor and give it more height so this was one i actually painted it was glass before and i just painted it this really nice light like salmon color another vase that we used on the tables i found two of these some more these ones both i painted so that's one tip is you can like spray paint or hand paint almost anything at goodwill so just keep that in mind that all of these can be hand painted or spray painted to the colors of your choice i'm serious when i say i thrifted a ton of vases so here's some other small ones that we used on our tables a couple more so i liked actually having the variety instead of making everything look the same it was nice to be able to thrift things that kind of added a more unique decor to each table so yes i would highly recommend thrifting decorative bases but to go along with that i also thrifted um flower vases as well so personally at our wedding we did not do like flower arrangements like center pieces um but you can use these kinds of vases for your centerpieces we actually just did like a fake garland and pop some real flowers in it and then did a table runner and then added in some of the vases and the dried flowers and things like that but the reason why i thrifted these i personally don't like the look of these vases and wouldn't use them but you know to each their own i personally thrifted about six of these just to use for the bridesmaid bouquets to be able to soak in water since i was doing all the flowers on my own if you're interested in watching that video i have my diy like bridal bouquet and diy wedding flower video i'll have it linked up here um but yeah that is why i thrifted these vases but goodwill has a ton of vases uh and you can get them for like 99 cents each speaking of like glass vases we can move in to the candles so goodwill has a ton of these kinds of vases if i were to get these vases somewhere else they would range from like five dollars at hobby lobby so i actually decided to thrift all of these vases at the thrift store and most of the times i could get them for about 99 cents to a dollar fifty um another thing i did was thrift a ton of these candles lately goodwill has been like marking up these candles i think they know brides are going there so now some of these tall candles are selling for like seven dollars at goodwill which is just ridiculous so if you can find a goodwill that prices them at a good point you can get these candles anywhere between like a dollar and three dollars plus that 20 off so i ended up thrifting about i think 26 to 30 of these to put on tables and most of the candles in them are thrifted as well however if you guys are looking for a bunch of pillar candles i would recommend going to the store at home um that's where i ended up buying some some more when i didn't have enough when i couldn't find enough in the thrift store i just went at home to find the rest of the pillar candles but i would highly recommend buying you know all of your vases from a thrift store okay speaking of candles that was another big thing that i thrifted i threaded as many candles as possible for example here is a bag of candles that we didn't end up using but if you go to your thrift store they have a ton of pillar candles but they also have like some smaller candles too i have had pretty good luck finding um small candles like this tea light candles and also candles like this um these ones actually came in a big box so that's another recommendation is look in the candle section make sure to look in the boxes because you never know what's hiding in them um i found just like a whole box of tea light candles um and then a whole lot of what are these called i forget what these are called but anyway candles get your candles at the thrift store if you can um you can get like i think i got this whole pack for maybe like two dollars so that was a good deal another kind of candles that i found at the thrift store were these ones these are kind of like the amber colored glass that's very in right now so i found a pack of like eight of these for maybe like four dollars so definitely recommend checking out the candles every time you go more candle related stuff i also found unique candle holders so they have a lot of like brass candle holders and we use these throughout our wedding just pop one of these in and it is a really um pretty accent but you can also find candle holders like this that are a little bit more like i guess more modern i would say these were actually a dark wood color and i just painted them like i did with all my faces i did find some cool wooden ones that i didn't have to paint this one is really beautiful and as you can see it's just a candle holder i found this one as well and it just has like a small spot to put a tea light candle in and these are amazing because i can use these to decorate our apartment these were actually from world market this was originally eight dollars i probably got it for like two dollars um another unique way i kind of thrifted for candles was actually going to their glass cup section and finding goblet cups to hold tea light candles in so i found this like beautiful glass one i feel like these are really popular right now for like rental companies and they cost a ton to rent or you can just go to the thrift store and find these and buy them for like a dollar each so what we did was we bought probably at least 20 of these and put tea light candles and that way they could go throughout the tables and they paired nicely like sitting next to this just to add a little bit more decoration i find just having this on the tables can be a little boring so i wanted another way to display candles that was a little more exciting so these glass cups like really went a long way when it came to decorating the tables here is another example of a glass cup we use this one was a shorter cup i also found glass cups like this i don't know usually what these would be used for maybe like dessert i'm not really sure what people would have used these for in the past or to hold trinkets or whatever but we use these for tea light candles as well i also found quite a few brass candle holders you just have to be careful sometimes they really overprice them i probably wouldn't pay more than five dollars for one of these this one in particular was 350 and we use these throughout our wedding decor but we also use these around the house and here are just some more examples of different candle holders that you can find at the thrift store another amazing candle find was this one and it is um kind of like a beauty and the beast inspired what are these called i don't know what these are called but a candle stick holder and i really like this one and decided to use this as the main feature on our sweetheart table and it was really beautiful on the table it looked amazing and i believe i got this from maybe like five to seven dollars more candle holders this one was a brass candle holder and they have quite a few of these i would definitely recommend looking for the candle holders that actually have a tray underneath to catch the wax i know a lot of places do not allow open flames however that's usually because they don't want the wax to get on the table so if you maybe see if this is allowed where it catches the wax one thing we did was lay a table runner down underneath any exposed candles and the wax just fell on the table runners okay a miscellaneous thing that i got for our wedding was actually this basket and what we did was place a smaller bowl inside of it and this is what we use for our foot washing ceremony for those of you who are asking kyle did wash my feet i will put in proof now um it's just the live stream was the camera overheated when he went so he actually washed my feet first but anyway this is the basket we used found it on at goodwill again this is something you could easily use in your home after your wedding okay and the last thing that i thrifted were these it's kind of like a gold shell thing there's a ton of like antique things like this at the thrift store what we use this for was on our welcome table and we put the film for like the polaroid cameras and set in here just like small little bowls and baskets can never hurt you i mean if you can find a cute way to store the film for the camera and this is also something you can use throughout your house afterwards or resell so i hope this video gave you some ideas on what you can thrift for your wedding i know it was such a fun like experience to be able to thrift all of this stuff for my wedding and i highly encourage you to thrift instead of buying new for one it'll save you money um it's fun and it cuts down a little bit on consumerism so you can kind of recycle all of these old things that people don't want all right guys i hope you enjoyed watching this video if you did please give this video a thumbs up because it really supports my channel um feel free to share it with a friend who's getting married soon i love you all if you guys have any video requests please leave them in the comments i do want to hear your ideas especially non-wedding related videos let me know and i can start uploading um some more of those so thank you guys so much for watching i love you and jesus loves you more good morning everybody and welcome to today's video i am just going to be vlogging today we'll see how long i vlog for but you guys have seem to love watching the vlogs and i love filming them because it's really just like my reality of what i do in a day and it's just fun to like casually hang out with you guys so welcome back to the channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne i am curious to know what was the first video you guys ever saw of mine leave it in the comments let me give you a little bedroom update look at how beautiful the bed is i feel like it's an art to try to figure out how to like style your bed and i think i finally nailed it this is what i like settled on is the two big pillows in the back two like same neutral color like an oatmeal color and then two white pillows and then i just got this long pillow from creighton barrel and the best part about it is kyle made the bed this morning i love when he makes the bed it is the best but i'm gonna show you guys what i'm wearing today i feel like i don't do outfit outfits of the day very often that's usually because i stay in my pajamas a lot but i'm trying to get better about getting dressed dressed and like doing my makeup and hair so i can feel a little bit more put together and motivated to film and just work i guess so this is what i'm wearing just super cozy and oversized today this really big sweater i tend to buy my sweaters in like a large or extra large so they just fit like very cozy and then these camo pants from forever 21 and these boots are from seven dials the only thing i need to add is i think i'm gonna like layer a necklace over the sweater so let's see it's actually perfect because i just got a package in from anna louisa and if you guys have watched my previous videos you know i have worked with them before they are a sustainably made jewelry company and all their stuff is very high quality i will show you later like a book um compared to a different necklace i got versus theirs and how well it has held up um i just got to this point where i was tired of all of my jewelry rusting and i just wanted to invest a little bit more money in jewelry that was actually going to last so when they reached out and i got to try their products i was so excited and i'm very excited to be partnering with them again because they are one of my favorite companies to work with first off the packaging is beautiful and you can use this for travel this is the first one they sent it's like a little starburst i will have all of these linked in the description this is the next one i kind of wanted to do it's a little out of my comfort zone with the black but i feel like it's a really good like winter and fall jewelry place and it's actually layered so i'm not really good at layering my jewelry so having the built-in layer is very helpful to me and the last one which i feel like is definitely the most me piece is this little pearl drop so i love all of these i did want to show you actually one of the necklaces they sent me a long time ago i've had this one for months and look how shiny it still is and i just want to compare it to a different necklace that i had look at the difference the rust on this one and then how shiny and gold this one still is so just going to show that their pieces are such high quality i didn't even realize that this one was a two in one so i can actually wear this necklace alone or this one alone if i want to another amazing thing about anna louisa is their commitment to sustainability which i mentioned earlier but if you guys want more information on their mission and everything they do um you can check out their website for more information on that they are currently running a black friday sale so if you're interested in any of these pieces or uh just want to check out and browse their site they have a lot of really cute rings uh which i actually might pick up for myself because there's this one that's so cute i'll insert it here i really want it it's definitely on my wish list so if you guys want to check out anna louisa's black friday sale i will have a special link in the description box that takes you to some special offers it's currently 1pm kyle and i had some coffee this morning but i'm ready for another little caffeine boost so i'm actually gonna make a matcha latte um it's really simple and i figured i would show you how to do it or how i do it at least i know it's probably not like the most professional way but i don't have like a whisk or anything so we're gonna make it work so first thing you need is a high quality matcha powder this one is from teami blends and it is a ceremonial grade and i'm just gonna take   two teaspoons of it then i'm going to add a tiny bit of hot water in here i'm just going to add some oat milk and this is my secret ingredient lately is sweet cream i just add like a dash of this to give it some sweetness you can always add like sugar or maple syrup or one of those kinds of sweeteners also another secret ingredient cinnamon it seriously adds such a good flavor to the latte and then we're just gonna throw it in the blender it's so good i swear the little bit of cinnamon and a little bit of sweet cream immaculate oh left the fridge open i'm back in my cozy spot look how cozy this is also this chair is so cute it's so cozy and soft and it's from target in case you're wondering i asked you guys on instagram to send me a few questions because i wanted to do a little mini q a in this video so bella asks babies when question mark straight to the point i feel you um no idea that's just like all god's timing i'm using daisy which is a natural family planning she's actually in the store right here basically i just track my basal body temperature to see when i'm fertile guys it's a green day is this too much to talk about they can complete the task and you're not supposed to be able to get pregnant on green days so that's how it works we haven't been super risky with it but i'm not using really any other form of like birth control we're just using that but they say it takes a couple months for your body to get synced up with the daisy app so we're being a little careful but we're also just like god's timing you know if we wanted to control things i would say we would have kids in like two or three years but we're not trying to really control it all too much um and then i also am planning to do a full on i feel like i'm whispering i'm also planning to do a full-on like natural family planning video in the future i just don't think i've been using it long enough to really do an in-depth experience maybe after like a year of using it i will do that video but yeah you can look on youtube there's a ton of other videos on daisy and natural family planning ella s best worship music i've been loving maverick city music lately mckayla asked my favorite series or show i don't know i feel like gossip girl is probably my favorite because i watched it all the seasons like five or six times through which is insane uh i think like every two years i watch all of the gossip girl visits again it's kind of bad i don't know if i really watched it since being like a strong believer so i don't know if anything in it would be convicting now but i would probably say that was my favorite series but recently things that kyle and i have watched are the show's scandal um revenge this sounds really bad now that i'm just naming out the titles we're currently watching the mandalorian on disney plus it's a little bit better ava asked how many babies do we want um three or four depending on the genders jezeb fit asked how did you know your church was right for you um prayer for sure and i think once i realized what i needed in a church in this season that brought a lot of clarity so i think what i was communicating to kyle is that i really need a church that we can grow at because the engagement season was so just like dry for me spiritually just because there's so many distractions and then covet happened and all that stuff so it was just a very dry season for me and my relationship with jesus just so many adjustments in life so what we were really looking for in this season was a church for us to really grow at and help us grow and so god gave us a lot of peace about this church we knew it was a little bit they pushed the boundaries a little bit you know they're a little bit more into the gifts and spiritual gifts and prophecy and all those things which is all over the bible so obviously the bible encourages us to seek those gifts not idolize them but to seek them so we just knew that the church was very spirit spirit-filled spirit-led a lot of passion which is something we really wanted um but yeah i think overall just peace and it really fit what we needed in this season and then confirmation just continued to come by the people we would meet and just how amazing and loving everybody was just so soon so but you also have to consider sometimes god will call you to a church so that you can help the church grow and lead them in an area that is you know weak for them so i would just start by asking god like what is the purpose of the church i'm going to right now like do you want me to grow do you want me to lead do you want me to help them grow do you want me to connect with people corey asked how are you and kyle preparing for parenthood i'm in that process at the moment well congratulations i don't know if that means you're pregnant or you're just preparing but um   obviously we would love some time before we had babies but a philosophy i have recently acquired is it's never too early to learn so after going from being completely single to all of a sudden being engaged within two months i was in shock like wedding planning shock i had no idea what was happening and it was a huge transition and that's like not even that big of a deal you know so i can't even imagine going from not pregnant to pregnant and just all of the information out there and also like no child to child i feel like there is a huge learning curve so what i have been doing is just watching random videos on pregnancy and parenting like i am subscribed to milena ciciotti's videos and she posts a lot of parenting stuff and kyle always gives me crap about watching like so many baby videos and i'm like listen i'd rather learn all this stuff over time than get pregnant and then be like so stressed about learning everything so that's literally all i'm doing is just slowly consuming information on pregnancy and parenting can barely ask fun date ideas i'm running out of them huh okay me and kyle have been really into playing cards lately and playing games so i would highly recommend going on amazon or going to target that's what we did and just getting a couple games that are really portable so we got the game five crowns which is a rummy style game and it's card game and we have been playing that so much we went camping the other night played it there so what me and kyle did was we took the card game to like an outdoor mall and we just like got some boba tea sat down and we played cards and we probably look like the oldest couple ever but it was so much fun i just i have been really enjoying just playing games with kyle okay i think that is all the questions i'm gonna answer for now i think i answered like way more questions than i was expecting this whole video might just turn into a q a but let's continue on with the vlog sorry if it's a little loud i'm currently walking to the mailbox this morning we did our bible time um we have been become like super good about maintaining that routine in the morning um but when we leave the house it's really hard to maintain it because our whole i don't know environment changes so when we went camping we did it so that's something i want to get better at is while we're traveling or if something changes in our days that we can still you know read our bibles but right now kyle and i are reading uh we just read hebrews so we finished hebrews and now we decided to do separate bible time um i think more so i decided because i was talking to my friend and i don't know what it is but i think i really just need to work on my personal relationship with god and when you have a husband who loves jesus so much um sometimes you can like rely on them and it's kind of like a second hand faith from your husband um sorry about the noise but that's kind of what i was feeling i just felt like i was kind of relying on kyle during our bible studies instead of like really focusing on building my own relationship with jesus so right now we are reading separate books i'm in romans and he is in i think he just started first peter so sweet oh dang this is really jammed in cute branding kyle and i really both needed new phone cases and um if you guys know michelle reed she is constantly posting about case defy it's one of her sponsors and she really loves it so i decided to use her link and order our own cases so i'll show you when we get back okay this is kyle's office yeah this is my office like we said in the last vlog he likes to sit in his pajamas i'm so cozy we are we look very cozy i got work to do so why be uncomfortable while i'm doing it yeah you look beautiful you're really making me look like a bum no this sweatshirt's cute you guys i don't know if you guys saw but i thrifted that sweatshirt hashtag thrift queen quite a while ago um our cases came in i thought we could open them on camera it's a good look this is the one i got it's really cute and simple oh snap kyle we got him black and it's got like this red line in there but look on the bottom babe of the case other side what what no way dude that's super dope look what i got wait why did you just get wolf i think wolfe is super cute yeah well what's my name i know you're a little wolf you should've got well now we represent both the wolves so i decided to just get wolf ingrained in mine and then i got a wolf gang is this all backwards from kyle's probably but yeah that's okay they're like siri is going nuts oh wait this is paper you take her out of her cage for one moment and she just starts yelling at you this is what my case looked like before this is what my phone looked like before i really needed that upgrade this one was from amazon it was only like 10 bucks so it lasted quite a while just i used it for way too long so i'm very excited about the new case and it's so much lighter like this case is heavier than this with the phone maybe your pants don't fall to the ground anymore kyle has a just like a weird thing that all his sweatpants and all his shorts don't have like the ties the string ties and so he puts his phone in his pocket and then he walks around with his butt hanging out no no usually not in public but yeah never in public no i just don't think that's a good look i mean it's not necessarily a good look but like dude showing in my house my phone's bringing down my pants what are you gonna do i don't know i don't know what you're gonna do buy new pants with ties so in my last video you guys gave me a ton of good suggestions for that area there and one of the suggestions was a ladder a lamp so right now i'm browsing on zola because i have a little bit left of like wedding credit from people's gifts for the wedding and i'm browsing to see if i can find something to buy for there so i'm going to show you what i'm kind of looking at so for example this ladder i feel like is very nicely made it's it's just has like a natural shape to it however it is 200 which i just i don't think i'm prepared to spend that uh i think i need to browse pinterest i created a board called new place and i've just been pinning decor ideas that i really like so i'm checking the board to see if any of them feature a ladder this one does here too see i think that looks really good this one also has a ladder here are the ladders that i just it's just not my style like i feel like these ones are just more of like a farmhouse you know so that is my only reservation another option is a floor lamp and i like that idea but i think i might switch it up so i feel like that corner there needs more height and i feel like i need to take off the baskets reposition that photo and maybe throw like a cute lamp in that corner i think that would be cute or i could put a lamp here but i feel like it makes more sense for it to be in the corner because our living room doesn't get like a ton of great light from that little thing um so i would like to add some more lighting so i feel like a floor lamp would be a good option anyway i'm gonna keep browsing and i'll let you know if i make any decisions um and then i'll be on to my next project i have been looking at lamps for way too long so i'm gonna take a break and try to assemble this it's actually a plant stand from ikea and i bought it as like an entryway shoe storage i have no idea if it's going to work i'll insert some clips of us trying to figure it out when we write ikea but kyle and i came to ikea to pick up some stuff up for the media console and we're also looking for something for shoe storage but all this shoe storage solutions that we found are kind of like sold out so we're taking another approach we found this and it's actually a plant stand but i feel like it would look cute in the entryway and then we could just put shoes under there and then i could put some decor on the top of it possibly put shoes on that rock too but we're hardcore debating i just can't decide if it's like a weird height if it would be kind of like too low because yeah because entry tables usually go up to your waist i don't know i'm gonna assemble it there's only one way to find out and i'm gonna eat my truffle chips i just tried these from trader joe's and if you like truffle i would definitely recommend them they are very good so cool time lapse   okay so this is what it looks like i feel like i mean i really love the look of the plant stand itself i don't know if it necessarily matches the black mirror above it but i think i could play around with it i'm gonna do some styling options so i still have this big one here so you guys can let me know what you think do you like that one or is that a little too much   again yeah come on pull you got to pull you got it really cool come on get in there yeah there we go pull pull pull come on there you go you need to do this one too okay yeah if it's not good i took kyle a million times that he can't dry all of his shirts because they will shrink and i told cayenne a million times that i should only get dry well clothes because well i thrift you i thrifted you that too i thrift you things and then you shrink them and i try to tell you but i used to i used to shrink so much of my clothes i wasted hundreds of dollars shrinking my clothes this is why i should keep my wardrobe because i know my wardrobe will not shrink i got so fed up with shrinking all of my clothes that i finally get up learned my lesson hey can i just talk   i'm gonna fed up with you   anyway like i was saying eventually you learn your lesson and stop shrinking your clothes he needs a little more time so i'm just trying to be patient   kyle is on one sometimes he's a very high energy husband that was so loud yeah where are we going baby we are going to go on a treasure hunt where x marks the spot three lines down and a question mark pinch a squeeze a tropical breeze now you got the now you got the night you got the chills oh we're going to the thrift store no we're going to trade our jokes oh we're going to traders we can go to a thrift store well we have gift cards i don't think we have time i don't know when it closes but we're going to trader joe's we're going to trader joe's should we go to costco and maybe costco yeah okay all right have your hair in my mouth let's go pick it up dude stop acting you know emotion sickness is real delicious sickness is fake it's kind of like how i used to view jesus right you just make it up because you can't handle reality and how'd that turn out for you i was wrong so you're wrong say you're wrong about this most likely   i couldn't imagine having to deal with emotions like this that has to be like the worst thing because you're always in motion like yeah cars boats yeah i'm always in a car or in a boat     rotation is always spinning so we are currently always in motion okay i gotta go sunny guys look at a really cool mask before we go into trader joe's i wanted to show you guys these masks that i just got and this contraption so i just bought these like waffle knit ones on amazon there's a pack of four for twenty dollars um but these things one of my friends was showing these on instagram and it's basically a cage of like silicone that you put in under your mask to keep the mask from like hitting all of your makeup and also makes it easier to talk and breathe so i'll have them both linked in the description we're gonna go pick up some moki and see what other holiday treats they have in stock disclaimer though what baby you got a big nose like mine and a big face the guards are a little small they don't fit they make different sizes of the guards yeah i need to make a bigger size for bigger because i got this giant schnauze and it just gets in the way okay baby they are pretty cool i just got back from trader joe's we skipped on costco because i got too hungry but i thought i would do a little trader joe's haul this was more like a snack run because we have our hellofresh and we're going out of town so we're just gonna use all that for like real food don't lie this is our regular grocery shopping list no but usually i get like way more stuff with like eggs okay whatever a lot of moki we've been obsessed with moki we tried it for the first time the other week or maybe the other month and then i know i think chris and johns actually recommended the trader joe's moki so we've tried strawberry and the chocolate peanut butter both are equally good but today we're gonna try the mini mochi no no drum rolls this is my channel i feel like right before my period is just not the best time to be tiring are you guys starting to put the two and two together with what we just got at the grocery store with what she just said okay let me finish the whole thing so we can eat i love you i love you have fun bye guys kyle's stuck in his crunchy cookie butter he can eat a jar of that in one sitting i got some hot cocoa we got a couple wines to try some oat milk i really just felt like croissants would be good corn and chili salsa this is really yummy if you've never tried it this was definitely a hormonal purchase i've never tried these before but i hope they're really good the focaccia bread yum we've tried this it's just caramel and cheddar popcorn mix haven't tried this butter toffee pretzels i love the butter toffee nuts that they have so excited to try that here we would taste test just a couple of things that we've never tried so we're going to start with the mini mango there's so many peas cheers cheers baby oh well frozen     usually it's ice cream in time yeah but this is actually just frozen mango inside it's a little bit different it grows on you yeah it definitely grows on you i think i prefer the ice cream better me too that's just me okay you do but this is like a it's just like a a sweet like feels healthier yeah treat i don't know how much healthier it really is but it feels healthier well instead of ice cream all right next thing we're going to try are those pretzels the butter toffee pretzels we've never had these no we have not oh i was not expecting this oh i want this one it cheers like the sweet chex mix blend but better but it tastes like a handful of that you just threw it in your mouth this is a good it's like a lot of sugar on a pretzel uh-huh all right it's a good fine let's cook dinner just finished cooking our dinner maybe not presented by the sink turned out pretty good we haven't tried it yet except for the carrots yeah we burnt the carrots definitely burnt the carrots right before we were sitting down for dinner we knocked a wine glass all over the sheets the bed the wall brand new sheets a rough life hopefully it all come out hey guys editing cayenne here and dishwashing kyle here so the last clip you saw was us spilling wine it's been a couple days since then do you want to say anything about the wine spill cayenne is just such a slob she just spills all the time even though this time was me it's true she spills all the time no yeah it was a rookie mistake i shouldn't have thrown the hoodie it was rough it was a rough night actually yeah it was pretty tough i'm more so like i spill all the time so i'm used to it so i just like i'm pretty light-hearted about messes and i'm very light-hearted when she spills yeah but when kyle spills because i don't spill when kyle spills he gets i get like this sense of like feeling ashamed and disappointed and i beat up on myself and i have a very very hard time like letting it go and communicating yeah i just kind of like close up and shut down and like i just need to fix it like i need to clean it i need to fix it and i'm just like let's dance like the bed it's a mess red wine everywhere yeah so yeah it's something that you know the lord's working on me with slowly but surely i don't spill enough for him to really like beat it out of me but but regardless yeah it ended up being a rough night and uh kind of took me to the next morning to like be like fully you know surrendered and released of it all and be able to have a conversation with cayenne about but yeah life ain't perfect you know what i'm saying perfect neither are we you know it's all good it's all right i know literally the most random things but anyway you know we're all about sharing the real moments so wanted to include that and now it's a couple days later and i'm editing the video and now i'm closing it out so i just wanted to say bye guys thank you for watching hope you enjoyed it thank you again to anna louisa for sponsoring this video and just a reminder the links will all be in the description so i'll see you next time bye peace this is the way this is the way this is the way must leave the bed   okay i'm not there i miss you so in the morning one of the first things we do is make our coffee and as you can see right next to the coffee i have my vitamins so i don't forget to take them if you guys haven't heard of carob i don't know where you've been because they are so popular and i actually first tried carob in 2018 with my own money i used somebody's code and let me tell you i've never been someone to take vitamins because one i never remember and two i'm really bad at swallowing pills i've literally had to train myself it's just a whole nother thing i will not take any vitamins on camera because you would just be grossed out kyle makes fun of me all the time it's the funniest thing you would ever see i have to like launch them down my throat anyway when it comes to vitamins i just feel like it's so hard to figure out which ones to take it's so overwhelming so i do love the simplicity of the care of quiz you just insert all of this information about you and they tell you a custom plan that fits and suits your specific needs so me specifically i've really been struggling with like bloating and digestion so one of the vitamins they included in here were the probiotics which is like designed to help your gut function better so i do love that and after the quiz they give you a breakdown of every single vitamin and why they're recommending it another thing about these products is the packaging is actually compostable so if you want more information on how to compost your packaging properly i will have a link right here that was perfect timing sound effects the doorbell right if you are interested in trying carob i have a 50 discount code which is amazing that is such a good deal so if you use the code cayenne 50 you'll get 50 off of your order some other things you can check out they do have like protein powders and other supplement powders i currently have the vegan vanilla protein and it tastes really good so i would definitely recommend those as well thank you again to cara for working with me if you guys are interested in signing up for their monthly subscription i will have links in the description and let's get into bible time because you know i need the lord right now amen oh no i started the camera again no i'm not joking do you want to give them a hint baby of what just came in uh what kind of hint can i give it's something very cozy it's something very cozy very cozy can you guess don't say anything else that's all you   get   have a quick breakfast because we're all out of eggs but lately we've been having these chicken cilantro lime burritos from costco and they're so good how's gonna make me breakfast because i need to keep reading sorry don't shoot me kyle and i went to a boxing class yesterday so i learned how to punch you should know that i can beat you if i wanted to but i don't want to because i am kind and gentle oh yeah sometimes sometimes well it should probably be all the time oh here we go because i was just reading in first peter chapter three by the conduct of their wives when they see the respectful and pure conduct for this is how the holy woman who hoped in god used to adorn themselves by submitting to their own husbands so what were you saying baby people are gonna come at you and be like how dare he try to tell his wife to submit not my words guys don't don't shoot the messenger kyle and i are about to have a meeting for hallelujah blue it just felt great okay see ya if you guys don't know what that is i actually dreamt it up with god oh my goodness maybe like two years ago now maybe more and i was actually about to launch it um before i moved to illinois but then i just like never did like i did the branding i did the website i did product photography but yeah i never ended up launching it it's basically an online store for faith based products and i'm really excited because i'm gonna launch it i guess it would be early 2021 wow yeah so i'm gonna launch it early 2021 i am gonna document kind of the behind the scenes of what's going into the launch i did want to partner with some professionals so i'm working with found it digital which is actually somebody who i've worked with in the past um we worked at the same company and then i've also done some freelance for them so and she goes to my church and she's awesome so i love crystal so i'll be documenting everything but yeah we're about to have a meeting they're presenting some creative direction for the brand if you're gonna drop this though you gotta tell them the coolest part about it what the mission no i'm gonna do it in a different video okay yeah i'm just doing little tiny bite-sized pieces but yeah there's a huge there's a huge mission behind it but it's still in the development phase yeah like god is still planting little seeds of ideas of what he wants it to be and look like so really excited for that so we're gonna have a meeting and then after that i have to leave for a workout i'm gonna go to pilates i'm really sore from boxing and i regret so much booking this class but i'm so proud of you you guys know on class pass if you cancel within 12 hours they charge you money so it keeps you accountable to go yeah because i thought about canceling for sure multiple times today not happening all right gotta go just finished my pilates class it was awesome but came out to a couple texts from kyle saying that my car has a massive oil leak apparently in the garage there's oil everywhere and we just brought my car in to get fixed and just picked it up yesterday so now it has to get towed back to pet boys so i think i'm gonna try to find a grocery store because i do want to get groceries and then i'm going to head home wait for the tow truck made it home oh wait why are i we're awkward the reason my shirt disappeared is because i got oil on it i didn't tell you that which one the one the white one with the cross i'm so saddened by it but oil doesn't really come out and i sprayed it and i put it in the watch though well i made it back i got toad pet boys kyle he knows i hate when he makes loud noises while i'm vlogging i do the you vlog when i do the dishes listen i just needed to update the people that i made at home i took a nice shower oh i'm so sore i need to like oh man i'm so sorry i can barely hold you guys up and i'm just holding an iphone right now yeah the fact that you went round two the day after it was aggressive it was aggressive we did our first workout i've been in the game in a while yeah we did our first workout yesterday a kickboxing workout and we haven't worked out in like months so literally yeah we're ready to start being active again i think we've been really tired and groggy and just not feeling like the best versions of ourselves and i think a huge factor in that is because we haven't worked out and it feels good that the weddings pass i just totally stopped working out before the wedding called in two most people like go extra hard before their wedding so they want like that wedding bod and everything yeah yeah we did the exact opposite yeah i mean of course i would have liked to have lost some weight before the wedding but honestly i was just to a point where i was like you know what forget this forget this stuff i'm just it is what it is my body's the way that it is and i'm just gonna embrace it thanks baby so now it feels good to just work out because literally all we want to do is feel healthier and better it's like there's no other agenda like i'm not trying to change myself this is our meal today some good old sloppy joes i haven't had a sloppy joe in so long so this one looks pretty easy what are you doing in fact cayenne never finishes her drink she i'm gonna finish that right now the tiniest bit in every single cup i'm sure there's so many people who do this i don't know why okay every single time i don't know why i know i showed you guys a setting this up last video but i wanted to give you an update on how i decided to decorate it basket here for keys and then i have this bowl from crate barrel that i just put masks in and as you can see not very good at actually putting my shoes under here just did a major cleanup of the kitchen and the living room i'm still gonna clean up a bit more but looks really good so far i decided to move my care of protein that i mentioned earlier so ikea sells these really beautiful jars with the bamboo lids i believe they're about they sell them separately so i feel like the lids i think all together it's about eight dollars a jar which is a pretty good price compared to the other ones i've seen online but i really like the aesthetic of them so i'm going to move my care of protein that i mentioned earlier into here super cute also have this chocolate protein so i feel like i might leave them out on the counter so it's like easy access   i'm trying to decorate this coffee table but i just feel like uh i think i need like actual big coffee table books and maybe like a tray of some sort i'll insert some inspiration now but i feel like i can just leave it like this for now i have some dried flower options so i'm gonna play around with this vase that's pretty cute i don't know if that is too crazy i feel like this may be a little too much i have some greenery in my last video you guys gave me a lot of good advice for this i still haven't acted upon it yet but right now i'm gonna like take a picture of this listed on offer up and just clear out of this corner so i can kind of get a feel for what it'll look like without it     this is what it looks like now without the desk so it looks super bare in my opinion so i think i'm gonna play around with it maybe a lamp i'll try to get or i could probably move like the plant over here and put a lamp in that corner it does really open up the space to like walk more it's like it feels super wide now does this happen to anybody else you're just like in the middle of doing something and then all of a sudden you find yourself on instagram scrolling for 15 minutes and then you realize oh i'm laying on the floor and i was supposed to be cleaning this up oh okay i need to snap out i've just been on a redecorating what's it called binge so let me show you what i did i took down those baskets i think i'm gonna put like a tall lamp there and then i move this plant here and i hope as it grows taller it will fill the space a bit more swapped out the vase on this table i think that looks good this is all stuff i'm like giving away i put this one here i think it's really cute in that corner i cleaned up all of that mess over here started organizing it some picture frames there that i need to go through this plant i'm pretty sure is gonna die so uh if you guys have any plant advice a lot of it has died already i had to snip off some of the ends i made the most delicious snack i posted on my instagram sorry it's super easy you literally just melt butter and marshmallows until it all melts and you pour it over your popcorn and toss it in it and it's just marshmallow popcorn i highly recommend adding some m ms i like it with peanut m ms but we don't have any it's so good i kind of just eyeball it i'd probably say like a cup of marshmallows and like a tablespoon or two tablespoons of butter you can also google it it's so delicious kyle and i are in bed it's seven we're getting old which is crazy we don't go to bed this early last night we went to bed at like 12 30 but ideally we'd like to go to bed probably like 11. i mean yeah on a normal night closer to 11 11 30. something like that something like that but i think we're just gonna hang out in bed kyle's reading first peter i'm sucked in to first peter right now you've read it like i literally i i honestly over the last week i probably read it like i don't know 10 times and every time i just get more and more out of it first there's like simple highlighting and now i'm like going through and just like breaking it down and guys just showed me so much through it but if you haven't read first peter you have no idea what i'm talking about go read first peter and like read it pray on it meditate on it and like ask god to show you what he's saying in this because there is so much fire if you guys didn't know kyle has his own youtube channel so i'll have a link right here he does a ton of bible studies and faith related videos so definitely go subscribe and then we also have a couple's channel together which i'll have right here i have my blue white blocking glasses on these are from diff so i just want to wear them i'm going to be on my computer a little bit so i know being on your phone at night or your computer at night isn't great for sleeping well so these are supposed to help so yeah i'm gonna wrap up the vlog here thank you again to cara for sponsoring this video and just a reminder if you guys want 50 off your first month use my code cayenne 50 and i'll put all the links in the description thank you guys so much for watching and supporting us supporting our family last time i said family you thought i was pregnant me was the way you said it uh you'll have to see the birthday vlog the colorado birthday blog where he opens his gift in his card i wrote family and he thought i was like telling him i was pregnant dude he's super like low-key but that's why i was a little taken back by it yeah i'm not sure i think this vlog will go up before that but be on the lookout for that one on the kayan and kyle channel and i'll see you in my next video i love you guys love you guys god bless bye it helps the speaker lead his audience into the scene he described by creating an imaginary picture ello everyone welcome back to my channel i'm so excited for today's video it is a decorate with me i honestly didn't think we were gonna be doing much decorating but i got the husband approval card and he said go for it so i'm so excited because this is our first christmas as a married couple i'm looking at kyle back here we're having a moment but this is our i realize this is your entire christmas gift it's the ability to go wild with decorations i'm not gonna go that wild i try to we'll see anyway i'm so excited to be decorating for christmas all right before we get into the video and all the decorating and the haul i wanted to say thank you to today's sponsor which is teami blends i actually heard about this brand years ago so i was excited when a familiar brand reached out to me they sent me their super greens powder it looks like this this thing is packed with 16 different superfood greens and they basically created this product because only one in 10 americans get their daily intake for vegetables every day and i am sure one of those nine that doesn't me and kyle have not been eating the healthiest lately and we've been feeling it so i was really excited to try this because i do want to get my greens in i literally have bags of spinach in my fridge i buy them every week and every week they go bad because i never end up eating them so the fact that i can throw this in a smoothie is seriously such a lifesaver this product is 100 plant-based it's vegan gluten-free dairy and soy free gmo free and it is made without fillers additives artificial flavors artificial colors and artificial chemicals just to name a few of the ingredients wheat grass chlorophyll powder spirulina powder spinach leaf powder broccoli powder kale powder kelp powder rocket leaf powder parsley powder celery powder grape seed extract and dandelion extract there is none of those crazy ingredients that you can't pronounce so typically what i like to do with my super greens is throw them in a smoothie i like to add some banana pineapple almond milk i will insert a clip now of me making one of my favorite smoothies so you guys can have the recipe   uh   if you guys want to save some money on your teami blends order i will have a coupon code right here that you can use it is cayenne 30 for 30 off and i will have a link in the description as well so thank you again to teami blends for sponsoring this video and now let's get in to the decorating okay so i wanted to quickly show you everything i got before i start decorating we'll probably end up filming some of the decorating today some of it tomorrow so i wanted to sit down and just do a haul she went on pinterest and just screenshotted a bunch of like inspiration photos for kind of the look i was going for that was really helpful as i was shopping through the store so i'll insert some of the inspiration now so you can kind of see the look that i was going for so i'm gonna start with target honestly i feel like i'm late to the game which is ridiculous because it's not even thanksgiving but a lot of the decorations are like sold out so in the target section i found some of these cute like mini garlands um each of these were three dollars and i figured i could just take these and put them in vases that i already have so these were the three that i picked out in the target dollar section i found some cute stuff so i got these little like fluffy trees they're only a dollar each and i just think they're super cute the next thing i got in the target dollar section were these cute little houses i feel like these wooden houses are very in this year i also found this ornament okay now i'm gonna move into tj maxx slash home goods i went to two stores the first thing i found was this set of trees they do disconnect i really like the color of these very neutral and i thought they would pair nicely with the other decorations that i got this was ten dollars for the set of three so not too bad this is one of my favorite things that i found and it is the star to go on our christmas tree how cute is this very modern and i like the wood accent the next thing i got from home goods was this ornament i just thought it was a very pretty delicate it kind of looks like a dishwashing sponge but let's not talk about it and this was at all our 99 then i picked up some stockings for kyle and i so both of them look like this i'm not crazy about the sequins so i might just cut them off but i thought they would look very cute hanging right here the last store i went to was called at home it's like a huge department store it's basically like home depot but for decorations so i got a couple of ornaments this is the first one it was kind of hard to decide like what color scheme i wanted to go for but i figured i would just match the house so neutrals white and like pops of this like bronzy orange color i got this um wooden star i got a snowflake i got two of those so if you're looking for something kind of unique to put in your trees i would recommend getting things like this so they're kind of just like little sticks so you can put them in your tree or in your garlands but i found this really pretty star one it's pretty sparkly and i thought it would be a cute accent to add in to the trees so i got two of those the next thing i got were these pearl balls they come in packs of three and they're only two dollars so this is a great option to kind of spice up your tree life without breaking the bank so i got two three packs i got those same things in this like bronzy color so pretty so i got two packs of this as well the next thing i got was this garland it was from at home i really did like it because it had a very like realistic coloring and look to it so i thought this would be cute to put up here what i really liked was the price on this so i went to target first and a lot of their garlands were like 30 and this one was only 14.99 so i'm glad that i didn't buy any at target because i felt like those were kind of pricey and the next thing i got from at home was our christmas tree it's in a box right now but i really was not planning on getting a christmas tree but they had a black friday deal and it was 200 off it was on sale for 99. so i ended up going with that one and it's still very beautiful that is the haul for now i hope you guys enjoyed and now let's get into the decorating good morning it is the next day and i decided to wear my cozy pajamas because i just feel like decorating for christmas you should be in your cozy pajamas so i have my green smoothie here i made it with the teami blends superfood greens it actually tastes really good i'm not gonna lie the greens themselves have a greeny taste to them but with me i'm like if it doesn't taste like actual greens how do i even know that it's working or like it's like real so i'm glad that it has the green taste to it but you can really offset that flavor with pineapple i've found it really helps um even out the flavor within your smoothie so that's just a little tip i figured we would start decorating over here       when everything is white glamouring still white and stillness fills the night it's christmas a winter wonderland a snowball in each hand take me away christmas day there's joy in the air   family's near we give thanks for this past year oh nothing   a green red now i'm gonna move to setting up our tree so i just bought this one from at home like i mentioned it was on sale for 99. and it is a gorgeous like frosted tree it is seven feet tall so um i was planning to put it in this corner however i don't know if it's gonna be too big so i just figured i would set it up and then if anything i can play around with it at different like maybe in the corner over there um i also want to get some like garland and we had twinkle lights i just cannot find them for the life of me but i want to get both of those to kind of decorate my plants with i thought that would be really cute for them to have a little christmas decor on them too   okay i got the tree set up it is a few hours later kyle and i went to a few stores because i wanted to pick up a couple more things for the tree and also to hang the stockings so i'm gonna do quick haul the first place we went was called kirklands i actually have only shopped there twice but they did have what i was looking for so i found these wooden garlands um after the discount i don't know i think we got them for like eight dollars each so that was a good deal i got two of those to use i also found this ornament then we went to joann's and if you have a joann's i would highly recommend going i don't know if they're going to be having it when this video is up but they had 60 off almost like all of their holiday stuff so i got a bunch of these like flowers to stick in the tree and around the house this is the first one i got two of these got two of these ones and then i found some cute like white pom pom ones so i thought these were really cute and i also found this one which is these glittery kind of like snow pom-poms so i also found these ones which are super cute so i got two of those then i found some wood ornaments so this is the first one this one and my favorite the christmas tree then we went to target just to get the command hooks and then i ended up just buying this one ornament here   it's a couple days later i ended up going to hobby lobby yesterday just to pick up a few more things it's like i can't stop there's like three different hauls in this video but i got these branches um with these pine cones on it i have like a really they're definitely taller so i have a tall vase i want to put them in i'm not sure where i'm going to put them in the house yet i also found this star um i decided to return the other star because it was really heavy and yeah it was just too heavy for our tree this one's a lot lighter i wanted a light up star but hopefully we didn't have any light up ones so i'm gonna see how this one looks i think it's cute very kind of like natural a little more of the boho look then i wanted to add a little bit more color and ornaments as you can see i have these um that's about all the color i have i mean and this isn't really considered color it's just like a natural like creamy champagne color but i just feel like we need a little more contrast you know hobby lobby is gonna come through with those jesus ornaments so i found this cross that just says believe so i thought that was cute and then i also found this one which is so sweet it's a in the manger so cute and then i found some really cool garlands i just found these fluff balls okay all right friends come on i bought these wooden ones but they just don't take up a lot of space and don't cover like the gaps as much so i thought i would layer and like switch between the wood and it doesn't go up all the all the way to the tree i didn't get enough of the wood one so i'm going to add these in but then i also found this knit garland which i thought was really unique also like that it takes up more space it has these little jingle bells on him so i thought it would be nice to just like layer the different garlands throughout the tree hopefully to fill in the gaps a little bit more the next thing i got was this guy and again a lot of their stuff looks very real so i like this i wanted to just stick this in a vase either on the coffee table or possibly on like the kitchen island just because this room is like super christmas like this side of the room but there's no christmas stuff anywhere else in the apartment so i thought this would tie in all the decorations a little bit more i got these i don't really know what i think i was planning to put them in the tree um i might put them in a vase as well around the apartment i don't know i don't know i don't uh am i regretting these possibly i thought these would look cute in the tree but uh you can't even see them so i have to figure out something else with them or just return them and the last thing i got was i think this is a mistletoe this was only a dollar and again everything just looks very real and i just thought this would be really cute to have hanging in the hallway so kyle will kiss me this should be the last haul of this video i'm just gonna add these decorations to the tree and around the house and then i'll do a final walk through and show you the completed result so if you guys remember these little tiny pom-poms were part of like a really long and strangly piece i broke them all off and then i decided to like intertwine them into these other fluff balls this is kind of what it looks like when it's all said and done but i actually watched a tutorial on tick tock i think and basically she recommended these stuff um method basically you stuff the ornaments further into the tree to fill out the gaps so you kind of like you don't want gaps like this so you would kind of stuff ornaments in here to kind of block it out or these fillers so i've been trying to kind of thicken up my fillers to fill these gaps better so let's say like that one there is a really bad gap so we need to figure out a way to fill that the first thing i did was just expand this branch a lot more like just turn these in different directions to kind of fill out that back and that has been very helpful     then maybe just put an ornament there   so when you walk in i decided to put that branch in this corner just to add a little christmas when you walk in and then i put this one in a vase over here so the kitchen has a little i had an extra thing of string light so i just hung it like that it's not like the classiest but i think it's cute around the plant let me know if you guys think i should keep it above the frame or if i should just wrap all the lights around the plant got the beautiful christmas tree   over here we have this setup we have our stockings little jesus i love the way that guy looks with the palms behind him so cute all the stuff from the target dollar section   i ended up wrapping some of the lead twinkle lights around these trees   and then put some back here and lulu is all lit up as well with twinkle lights i just love this i think it looks so you cozy us off from big to small   warm laughter and white smiles where presents stacked in piles take me away christmas day all right everybody that is the end of today's video i hope you enjoyed decorating with me and it gave you some inspiration for your place let me know in the comments again what your favorite holiday tradition is and i will see you guys in my next video bye okay i cheated however the lord has set it straight try not to drag god into our   relationship   hello everybody that sounded weird uh sometimes you just film yourself and you're like is this my real voice do i really sound like this do i ever really talk like that like do i ever go up to my friend and say hello everybody no i don't but youtube is weird but hi i feel like i should just start my videos like hey what's up because that's how i would say hi to a friend so today's vlog is gonna be kind of what me and kyle did for thanksgiving and black friday has been a long two days for sure we were trying to buy a car because both of our cars unexpectedly unexpectedly both of our cars kind of died on us kyle's car is about to die my car is undrivable now if you guys saw my last vlog we had to tow it and basically a mistake was made and the repair just would cost way more than the car is worth so we had to go through a whole process of trying to get a car the last two days and we will take you on that journey also a big shout out to nordgreen for working with me on this video you will see their products later on i'm gonna do an unboxing but they did provide us with an amazing black friday code so stay tuned for that i am going to show you some new things i got in the mail some clothing uh i really anyone else do this they clean their clothes and never put them away i have a really really bad habit of doing that like this is all clean and i just hate putting away laundry i need to listen things are happening here just not happening right now our bedroom is an absolute disaster but i wanted to show you guys these pants because i just got some things in the mail and these were one of them and i thought they were really cute i needed more pants for winter time these are like faux leather they're from a brand called mark and spencer i think they sell them at department stores i'm not sure but yeah i really like these also got a skirt and some sweaters what i really wanted to talk to you guys about this morning was my hair my hair is getting so long and this is what it looks like usually my hair has more texture but lately it's just been kind of straight like oh so i'm kind of getting tired of my hair i haven't done anything to it besides a little trim in probably like a year and a half i was um if you guys have seen my vlogs usually i only get my hair done whenever i go to hawaii which sounds so ridiculous but my friend lives there who does hair so it's always a fun perk to go visit her and maui because she does my hair and she does an excellent job but this year's maui trip got cancelled um because of code so like what if we just you know cut it like that short added some layers maybe some this is not giving a good visual at all should i get bangs like this this is so not helpful they need to invent a way to like figure out a haircut you know i'm really considering cutting my hair if you guys have any ideas let me know because it's just long and boring and like these are my face framing pieces look how long they've grown out help me so i think i'm gonna get it done book an appointment like in december so let me know your ideas for sure okay another thing besides my hair is i wanted to show you what i got from nord green if you guys haven't heard of nordgreen before they are a company based in copenhagen and they are a scandinavian watch brand they make very like minimalistic classic timeless watches that will forever look good no matter what the trends are if you're gonna invest in a watch you want it to be something that's very timeless that you you know know is never gonna go out of style and these watches do just that another cool thing about nordgreen is all their watches are ethically made in danish owned factories and all of them are union certified so you know they really value the working conditions of their employees which is very important okay so the watch i got is actually called the native and it is this beautiful gold one i got it in the 32 millimeter i didn't want something that was going to be oversized i really wanted something more delicate and timeless and this is what it looks like it is the gold mesh and it does match my rings very nicely so that is another reason why i picked this one i've been really loving styling um over sweaters i think it is a very classy and cute a really easy way to just dress up your outfit another cool thing is that their bands are interchangeable so i also got this brown leather one because i can swap it out on days that i just want it to be a little bit more casual also a note about their packaging it is all up-cycled plastic and then the one i got kyle looks like this it's called the pioneer and i got it in the silver mesh so his wedding band is silver so this one matches very nicely and again the bands are interchangeable but i just love this watch it's super masculine but i just think it's very beautiful and timeless so nordgreen was kind enough to give us a 35 discount code so if you guys are interested in buying a watch or someone on your christmas shopping list wants to watch i will leave the code right here and also all the details in the description the deal is running through december 1st so you have a couple days to take advantage of that deal another really cool thing about nordgreen is their give back program so once you check out you can pick an organization that you want to give back to one of them gives water clean water to people another one gives one month of education to kids in india and the third one preserves the rainforest in latin america so those are all amazing things that are built into their mission as a company and you know we like to give back give back give back how is this my job i don't really know anyway thank you again to nordgreen for sponsoring this portion of the video and let's get into our thanksgiving shenanigans not even facing don't worry about me just like that on me i'm so cozy what do i look like right now i look like a yam i am that's a food i know you look like a crouton happy thanksgiving i didn't see you

you want to name our baby theophilus do you have phyllis wolfgang it's actually kind of cool i don't like it maybe anything theo is kind of cool see you i can't do this why i knew a guy named theo you're watching this sorry nothing personal i hate when that happens i just knew a guy named seon i hear the only person i ever met named theo and when i hear the name i just see him of the fathers to the children and the disobedience to the wisdom of the just make ready for the lord a people prepared what lord can you speak that over our children that would be epic didn't john the baptist get beheaded john did get beheaded but it was a good cause okay so we're fine with our children getting beheaded yeah for jesus for sure yeah for sure there's no greater honor being a martyr is like

trying to cheat you are such a cheater don't even you literally cheated earlier prove it okay i cheated yeah however the lord has set it straight and he has repaid you of your debts yes he has he's like nine points but my cheating wasn't necessarily cheating because he already had a back-up plan to my cheating i need you to set the card straight well that just because you need me to lose doesn't mean that it's not straight no because i got 37 points the round that you cheated but it wasn't in a way that affected that you would have gotten that maybe if i knew you cheated we would have read

it is moving why is it moving wait hold up that's baby what the heck is going on good morning everybody and welcome to today's vlog i decided just to vlog today and actually do like a themed vlog where i talk about a certain topic throughout the video so today's topic is just gonna be about being married and just different challenges we have faced since being newly married so kyle and i have been married for almost two months we got married october 4th and our wedding video should be done pretty soon definitely by the end of december it'll be posted so if you're not subscribed to the cayenne and kyle channel i'll have a link up here because that is where we're going to be posting our wedding video but i'm very excited to see it november's just been such a crazy month with work because it's the final corner it's the final quarter for companies so lots of sponsorships this month which i hope you guys don't mind um because the lord has blessed me with this being a full-time job now so yeah i hope you guys don't mind it uh i promise it won't be this intense moving forward you guys seem to not have complained about it so i really appreciate that speaking of sponsorships today's video is sponsored by nordgreen they actually sponsored a previous video as well it is the watch company so i will show you guys those a little later on but right now what what's happening right now kyle went to go meet with a couple of men from church so that's really awesome and i get the house to myself this morning which leads me to our first kind of struggle and i think more people can relate to this right now because of covid and a lot of people are working from home but since being married we are both working from home and let me tell you it has been a struggle i like think i can handle more than i can and then i don't say anything and then i get frustrated and moody but i realize that i really do need alone time at home um i need more alone time for sure that has been something we are struggling with kyle not so much he doesn't need as much alone time as i do or maybe it just doesn't affect him as much as it affects me but i was very used to having the house to myself at least a few days a week to do filming and just focus on my work so having kyle home like obviously he's my best friend and i love having him around but just i'm wired where i need more alone time uh and i'm kind of bad at setting those boundaries so kyle and i had another talk yesterday and he decided to   work like and do instacart again just three days a week because we could use um just extra money for savings and stuff like that so um he's gonna be out of the house three days a week now and then home two days to help out with filming and things like that and do his other work so that has been the first struggle um just trying to find alone time another thing that we were doing was i would wake up like 30 minutes 30 minutes to an hour before him and just start my devotional time alone and just like quiet and just have the house to myself he would be sleeping in the bedroom and i would just have this part of the house to myself which was actually very helpful so this morning i started my day going through the facebook comments i was going through proverbs 2 because today is day 2 of our 31 day challenge i don't think i've mentioned it on my channel yet i posted about it but i didn't mention it in the video so kyle and i are hosting a 31 day proverbs challenge where you read a proverb a day for the month of december so it's not too late to join we're only about a week in by the time you're seeing this so i'll leave a facebook link in the description so you guys can join we're really excited to be hosting another challenge this one is more unique because we are having a lot of our friends go live um throughout the month so you guys get wisdom from so many different people that we love uh and i i'm honestly excited to learn from all of them and participate as like not a leader i guess as a learner which we should always be a learner even if we are in leadership so yeah anyways i'll show you kind of what i've been doing this is what the proverbs 31 day challenge looks like and i changed the name of the facebook group each time we host a challenge so we also have the align with christ challenge in the same group we just did a live yesterday for day one and then we just have like reflections where people can post and then look at all these upcoming lives that we have so exciting     all right i'm all dressed i ended up switching out those pearl clips just bobby pinned them back i just thought they were a little too much with this hair and the outfits just like a little bit more professional and yep anyway i switched out the clips moral of the story as i said earlier in this video nordgreen is sponsoring another video of mine so thank you so much to nordgreen it has been a pleasure and i have been wearing these watches non-stop since i got them if you guys don't know what nordgreen is it is a scandinavian watch brand located in copenhagen um they make very simplistic timeless classy watches this is the one i got i also got one for kyle so they have men and women and as i mentioned in my last video i got some interchangeable bands and this is one thing i really love about their watches is i can easily swap out the bands to create a different look without buying a whole other watch so right now i have the mesh gold i will leave details to which watch this is right here if you guys want to buy it and i'm gonna swap out this one for the brown um leather strap and just like that i was able to swap out the band it seriously gives the watch such a different look i love how versatile these pieces are so you can easily match it with anything in your closet excuse you without having to buy a ton of different watches a few things that i love about nord green is their commitment to sustainability and they do that in a few different ways the first being that their factories are all danish owned and union certified so the working conditions are another thing that i love is their eco-friendly packaging everything is made from upcycled plastic yes and the best thing of all is their give back programs part of the proceeds will go to one of three organizations and you get to pick which one that is the first one gives two months of clean water to a family the second is giving one month of education to a child in india and the third option is to preserve 200 square feet of the rainforest in latin america so if you guys are interested in a beautiful watch from nordgreen i will have a 15 discount code for you right here right here and right here they are all the same but you know we had to spice it up a little bit like activate your brain power you know and that's gonna be it you know that is it thank you nord green for sponsoring this video and let's get a muchacho i'm losing my mind i'm gonna insert some outtakes later on in this video because this was a process let me tell you i'm going crazy are you guys ready to see this side of me i don't know but here she is that lighting really lights up my life really lights up my life this vlog has turned into a musical let me give you a jazz square a jazz square a jazz square it's a musical a musical a musical i encourage you to be yourself because there's some weirdos in this world and i am one of them i am so weird i am so weird are you weird i'm weird are you weird i'm weird wow i'm gonna have so much fun watching back this footage so we all thought this vlog was gonna be a little bit more serious talking about marriage issues but surprise i'm just exposing myself and being a weirdo okay it's like an hour later my friend stopped by to pick up something we had a bunch of extra meals and food and we're not gonna be able to eat it all so i wanted to give some to a friend and then i went to the mailbox we got a couple packages thought i would open them on camera because am i really a vlogger if i don't open packages on camera let's open these packages this is the worst angle in the whole entire world and it makes me feel very uncomfortable okay we're settled down i just got a package our young living order i order off of my account and kyle's account so i already got my order in but i ordered some things off of kyle's account they came in a little bit later i honestly can't really remember what i got so let's see what we do we got peppermint oil love peppermint i specifically use peppermint on my tummy if you have high quality oils peppermint is really helpful for bloating and i also like to use it like on my temples to help me like wake up gratitude i think this is a good oil to put on in the morning smells good supposed to help you stay grateful you know and then i got a couple bars of soap kyle loves using bar soap um is that a normal thing i i always use body wash but kyle loves bars of soap and he has been going through them like crazy so i thought i would try the young living ones the first one i got is peppermint cedar wood that smells good and then i got lavender oatmeal if you guys are a part of young loving let me know your fav products that i should try so i just finished filming the video i tried this new filming spot with like the christmas christmas decorations but yeah i just filmed a video on my wedding dress shopping experience and just inserting footage that i wasn't able to insert because obviously you keep your wedding dress a surprise i asked you guys on instagram to share some of your guys struggles when you first got married and they are so hilarious and good so there was a ton about like communication and figuring out how to communicate there was a lot about you know building routine and habits together and navigating around each other there was a lot about you know learning to give each other space also adjusting to people's different hygiene standards and like so many funny things some people said their biggest struggle was combining finances one person just said that they were really shocked that they weren't having sex every day and i think that's so hilarious i'm not saying because we're struggling with something in specific that marriage isn't great it is so great and it has been so amazing there's just a learning curve and adjustments especially when you like wait for marriage to have sex and to live together and combine your lives in a certain way there's definitely a learning curve so i think it's so important to talk about those things to help other people so yeah i'm not saying marriage isn't great when i bring up this topic i'm just saying that there are some struggles in it oh one person said that it was a struggle going from being very independent for like years to then being in this relationship where they needed to depend on each other more and that's kind of related to one of our big struggles right now and something we are overcoming is mostly me i like to do things my way oh that was another once people said they said learning that things can be done in different ways and not being okay that can be really hard because there are so many times you want to do things your own way some really good marriage advice that was on the sadie robertson podcast was that you are not your spouse's parent so don't treat them like you're like they are your child and i try to remember that one because it's so easy to try to like correct your spouse or make them do something your way and it just comes off as like you're parenting them and it's just an icky and icky feeling i wanted to share one of our big struggles right now which is that independence piece um i am very independent i am used to making my own decisions and doing things my way um and that is very hard in a marriage because as a wife and what we believe in the bible it you know the wife submits and also the wife submits to her husband but the husband also submits to god and he is a servant leader so in a way it's even more difficult for the husband because he's submitting to god and becoming a servant for his wife so anyway i'm not gonna get into the whole biblical um submission piece um just don't be offended by it because it is a beautiful thing and i believe that the man is supposed to be the leader in our relationship and he's supposed to lead me closer to jesus and help lead our family does that mean he makes all the decisions no definitely not i don't give him a lot of space to be a leader um and lately we've been running into especially when it comes to budgeting and finances that i have a very strong opinion and when he brings up things with finances or budgeting i kind of shut him down and don't give him any room to speak into that area and then in return he almost backs off and withdraws and that's not really his role in this relationship either it's not like the healthiest place to be and i kind of become more of like a dominating force and he um shuts down and withdraws instead of pursuing the conversation even when it's uncomfortable even if i do shut him down he's not pursuing the conversation enough but i'm also being too much if that makes sense ah it's just so easy to really think like your way is better but it's hard you gotta put that down at the feet of jesus and say okay maybe his way is better and i for sure know that god is trying to humble me during this season because i think i have marriage has made me realize that i have some pride issues and i am pretty stubborn but just to say all of this like it's super light-hearted because the bible says to rejoice in our struggles because they like give us perseverance and endurance and they make us stronger so i'm not sitting here complaining about all of our struggles or problems i'm just being real because talking about these things is how we all grow and process and i think it is extremely healthy to talk about these things even if you're not out here sharing it to the world like i am i would encourage you to have a close friend that you really trust um to confess and share your sins with so they can pray for you and you can receive healing there is so much power in sharing our sin amen to that jesus i love it i'm for it it's just moments like these that i go on my app my period app and just see if like it's coming you know but turns out periods not coming for another 11 days so my feistiness and this situation is not as justified as it normally would be i forgot to open the other package and it is literally the best thing ever like such an amazing adventure adventure such an amazing invention so i'm sharing it with you guys look at this it's a literally a sauce holder for your car like this is genius i'll take it out of the package don't worry i did not get that red color i was like very scared when i got this package i was like i do not want that red thing in my car but it's just a fun thing super cheap i'll have the amazon link to like it's such a good like stocking stuffer or just a gift like i'm definitely gonna give one of these to my brothers for his christmas present it just pops into your vent and basically you can put it in here or you can take it out and put it like vertically instead of horizontally alright guys i have talked a lot in this video and a lot of crazy things have happened thank you for bearing with me i hope you guys enjoy this vlog and i will see you in the next video i love you guys so much jesus loves you more goodbye lord help me speak and and and and and what and you and me and three and i'm good come on crying like i'm going crazy don't worry folks i am not possessed by a demon i am all over the place but i'm not in the right place i'm just all over and i cannot hit the target i need to breathe a little bit i am talking fast let's take a breath together everybody everybody everybody   i think i had too much coffee okay i am okay i have poured out my soul my heart and soul into this collaboration i need to get rid of these nails because i keep finding myself doing this look how long these suckers are not cute it's really not a cute look let me tell you let's talk about some other marriage struggles like please great transition out of this goofy segment hello everyone welcome to today's video i am going to be vlogging today so kyle and i started off our morning going through proverbs 7 because it is the seventh day of the proverbs 31 day challenge and our friend ryan did a live on it and brought just so much amazing wisdom and perspective on it so i'll insert a clip from that i always i had so many friends who are pastors hey man just talking about this this struggled i thought morning know what there isn't a place of being free of this but let me tell you this like there there is freedom and there is freedom in in accountability it is freedom um and this is you know basically having all this accountability and having people in the right place at the right time had just given me in and if you guys want to join the proverbs 31 day challenge you can start it any day so i have everything saved in the group and organized so you can do the challenge you know even if you didn't start the same day as everybody else so i will leave a link to our facebook group in the description so you guys can join it has been so amazing and transforming we're only a weekend and it's just so good it's so good um so today i wanted to attempt to do this diy insert it here i found it on instagram and i just thought it was such a beautiful piece of art and also she said she did it for under 20 so i have to drop kyle off we're kind of trying to share our new car um because his car is not in the best conditions so his is kind of just for emergencies and then we're sharing the new one which i don't think i have shown you our new car so i'll do that because it is so beautiful and we were very blessed to get it so that's amazing but yeah i'm dropping kyle off and then i'm gonna head to like hobby lobby or joann's um and home depot i think and just see what i can do look how beautiful she is i love it i love it i saw a sign that hobby lobby's hiring and sometimes i just get random urges to like work at retail stores or like a juice shop and i'm like oh that would be so fun to have a part-time job at like a juice shop or hobby lobby and then i remember when like back in the day when i used to work retail and at like american eagle and stuff and i'm like yeah it's really not that fun and yeah but sometimes i'm just like it would be nice to get out of the house and have a part-time job but during these circumstances where i'd have to wear a mask all the time i changed my mind real quick all right all i can really find is this big circle piece which i feel like i could use possibly this rainbow if we cut off the clouds would create like an interesting shape i just passed these little jars and i think they're so cute these are very aesthetic six dollars like if these were half off three dollars each that would be like a really good deal so all i'm saying these look like the ones i have from ikea but smaller i might come back when these are on sale oh this is so cute okay we just got back from the store i'm actually gonna pick up the project tomorrow because kyle and i have a date night and also i am so hungry i need to eat some dinner she's so hungry we both need to eat some dinner i'm so hungry um which brings me to today's sponsorship oh and it's a good one i'm so excited is there something there yeah i think it was in my mouth or something i don't know brings me to today's sponsorship which is literally the best sponsorship sponsorship in the world because it involves food and what's better than food well obviously jesus but after jesus it's just food just food always food so we are really excited to be working with green chef on this video as you guys know i mentioned meal kits in a few videos uh it is something i've been doing since we've been married because let me tell you trying to like cook for a family aka me and my husband was super intimidating for some reason because i had not been cooking and really didn't know any recipes so this was such an easy way to integrate cooking into our lifestyle and let me tell you i did not think i was going to be able to chef up these kinds of meals yeah so we are so excited to be working with them green chef is a usda certified organic company so that is amazing because they cater towards multiple lifestyles such as vegan vegetarian keto and paleo so if you have any of those diet restrictions this is definitely an amazing resource for you but if you're like me and you don't have any of those diet restrictions you can still utilize their services because these meals are bomb so we got in our box earlier this week basically what they do is they deliver meal kits to you on a weekly basis that's what how often we get ours at least and they deliver us meal kits with all the ingredients pre-portioned so none of your um groceries are going to go bad because that happens to me all the time when i'm trying to cook i buy things and they just go bad because i don't use them so they give you the perfect portions for each recipe and then they send you along a few recipe cards i actually already made these memphis meatballs they were so good literally any of the meatball recipes would highly recommend them so when you open up the bag it'll look something like this also the proteins are hiding at the bottom of the bag so don't forget to grab those the proteins in the fridge right now but yeah this is what it looks like so it's the exact portion you need for the recipe which i love like we don't need a full grain pepper we have a half of one and i know this may look like a lot of plastic but green chef is actually the most sustainable meal kit company because they offset a hundred percent of their carbon emissions so that is a amazing the recipes are so easy to follow because it's like pictures even kyle can do it right kyle it's husband proof it's husband proof your husband should be able to make these so that's awesome all right we got kyle he started chefing up taking care of the kale for us um i'm so hungry that i'm like you just cook i'm on it baby

gotta put the um in there yeah but sometimes especially times like this where my you know what is coming for the hills anyway we're going on a date we are going to it's called christmas at princess at the princess that's the princess yes yeah and they basically just decorate i'll call but instead of talking to you about it we'll just show you it yeah come along we're gonna have fun just come with us guys it's gonna be a blast just come along here we go ready what let's go and then that's when you there you go i kind of thought this was an apple i just remember it was big and red and circular it does kind of look like an applesauce so they gave us this paper lantern and we're gonna decorate it and write our prayers on it they say hope streams wishes or prayers and i said amen she said we need more of that and then she ended with we'll send out the energy to the universe she said the good vibes to the universe i was like let's go back let's go back to the prayers and the amen with jesus then we're gonna decorate this with our prayers fun fact kyle is left-handed oh no and this is the worst part about being a left-hander dang it smeared oh that's not a good look no what a rough story lefty stink you got to do the writing baby isn't that the most beautiful star you've ever seen kind of looks like a spider yeah i'm trying to make the bethlehem story i know the north star it's okay oh i probably would have just kept it better if you guys didn't know we were artists that looks like a bullseye what is going on baby it looked actually pretty good in the beginning well you made me insecure i know well you didn't even like take a second to pray on it you just acted and this is what happens when we take action without praying guys it's a christmas tree do you think it's better i think it's a little disreported i think like jesus it has been redeemed we it has been redeemed like us in christ um you know i think it just might be time to move on from it it looks beautiful baby i could make these bigger no no no no no no no no i love it it's gorgeous you know it's not it's not complete without some scripture cayenne just wrote such a good prayer so i'm having her squeeze in jesus name on the bottom because that's where all the power is it's so good what'd you say i pray that everyone would be saved and love jesus i pray for peace and harmony i pray you heal our land and forgive us of our sins in jesus name in jesus name amen so good all right one side to go what are we gonna do and she finishes up with that's a good start baby i need it yeah that's good redemption and of course you can't go wrong with the name of jesus   thank you amen come on that's what i'm talking about amen jesus went from walking on water to floating on water   no jesus is like i will never leave you nor forsake you he knows that i know that amen birth to her firstborn a son she wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end and there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby keeping watch over their flocks at night   is it okay to have my mask off up here no the mask the mass police will get you don't get me i'm innocent   oh my gosh my blood's tingling why am i so scared i think i'm like not scared of super heights but like this kind of height i'm scared of you're not scared of super heights like roller coasters i'm not scared of but this is this kind of this kind of height where it's like not that far off the ground oh it hits it hits me look at these chili cheese   have you ever seen a wolf on a lion before oh shoot i've ruined that have you ever seen a wolf on a tiger before no i have it i have a pink pony good morning it is the next day and we are going to get started on that diy project so i wanted to give you a rundown of everything that i bought first while i was in lowe's the kind workers showed me that they had all of this wood that's just scrap wood so it was all free so i got all of this i definitely don't need all of this but i figured if i made multiple pieces we're especially going to use these really thin ones and then i also found some big pieces so i thought this size was really nice especially if i wanted to put two next to each other but then i found this one and they cut it a little bit smaller and i thought this would be a really good size to go above the console but these pieces are really heavy so i just got it because it was free but if you can find a thinner piece that would be more ideal so it can actually hang on the wall this is going to be way too heavy to probably hang on our walls so we're just going to have it leaning up above the console i found these two circle pieces this is the only wood i spent money on these were like eight dollars each if you guys have a jigsaw don't even bother buying one of these just cut the circles yourself these are also pretty thick which is also not ideal but we're making it work then i got a bunch of different paint check out their samples like their mistake ones and you can find like good deals this was only 250. found a couple samples that were only 125. i will show you paint later at hobby lobby i got this big   piece of foam and i figured i could cut it in half and do like three dimensional half circles or something with it and then we have our lovely husband here ready to help i never know what i'm doing but you always just gotta prepare for the worst okay so you just gotta bring all the tools you're showing off all your tools huh a little bit yeah this is the first time using these yeah i'm excited that's why i really wanted to do this project no it's not yeah it is i was like we need to break in your tools yeah you know i think you really did just get me these souls for your own yeah all the diys yeah while he's sanding i'm going to figure out kind of a color that i liked so these are the three ones that i got i will have their names inserted here   all right i'm still playing around but the next thing i'm going to have kyle do is cut this with that rounded edge and hopefully slim it down a little bit on the side   oh my goodness look at that line did i get water there that's so bad i did self tanner this morning all right i need to fix that up but i basically laid down all of the wood pieces with glue but i'm waiting for them to dry so i just put some heavy wood on top and hopefully everything's gonna stay okay i got a couple things in the mail that i thought i would show you so the first thing i got was from this company artsa and it actually um they hand put they hand pick and locally source um items from bethlehem so i think that's really cool the holy land delivered um so i'm gonna open this up and see what they sent she did give me like a special link so i will include this in the description if you are interested i am actually really surprised how much stuff came in this box there's candle ornaments chocolate nut butter toffee postcards a hot plate coasters super cute thank you for sending me this i will have a link in the description it's cool that they're all handmade in israel okay next package is from petal and pup so i have been eyeing these corduroy pants for like a month now and they were on sale for black friday so i finally took the plunge i love these i just wanted something cute and like comfy some pants for fall and winter and i think these are gonna be perfect they come in a bunch of different colors too then i got this sweater i really loved this neckline on here but yeah it's just a basic white loose sweater and then i got this black ribbed sweater and it has like this underwire detailing i thought it was really pretty and also don't own a ton of black stuff and especially like tighter sweaters so i thought these would all be great additions for the winter and the fall i'm gonna cook dinner i think i'm gonna actually do the last green chef meal that we have this week which i'm really excited about all the food is always so good so again thank you to green chef for sponsoring this video i still haven't finished the project yet um because the paint's drying it actually should be dry right now but it's getting a little late so i think i'm gonna finish up tomorrow and i will insert some footage because i just feel like i don't know i hate to leave you hanging like this is where i should end the vlog but if there's just something so satisfying about seeing the whole project in one vlog so i feel like i just need this will be my motivation to get up early and finish it so i can show it to you guys so i will insert some more footage after this okay it is the next day it actually rained last night which is a miracle because that hasn't rained here in over like 130 days or so yeah a night someone's at nine months i don't know if that's true but look at the mountains you can barely see them because there's just fog and clouds going through them but oh it's so nice the air is so crisp but it is time for the final reveal of our art project and i'm feeling it out still but this is what it looks like here is the final look i do think it is beautiful i just i don't know if it's beautiful where it's at i think it would look really good hung up on the wall but kyle says there's no chance that that's gonna happen so i just think because this space is so big that this would look really good hung up a little bit but there's a chance it's just so heavy it is heavy but people hang up like really heavy mirrors you just have to put anchors in the wall and something on the back to hook it on yeah or we just screw right through it i would probably get uh you would want do you want to want that i would get a the wire the wire kit to put on the back but yeah sorry i can't really move because it's really heavy you in a little bit lower yeah i feel like that would just look really nice all right you guys let me know what you think in the comments but thank you to my husband for helping me this project if you guys want to help me tell her it looks fantastic right there where it's at without being home hung on the wall just be honest guys um honesty is the best policy so that is true just be honest where do you guys think we should put it do you guys like it or do you think i should try something else but yeah i'm going to end up out in the video here i love you guys jesus loves you more and i will see you in my next video hello hello hey what's up hey people hello friends what's up everybody welcome back to the channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne not can cayenne and if you're looking for a name for your child please consider okay anyway i'm cayenne so i feel like after that intro you probably won't forget my name hey everybody welcome back to the channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne and i am fluctuating my voice in an interesting way today how do you feel about my fluctuations of the voice tones it is making me quite uncomfortable and i'm going to stop right now anyway welcome back to my channel today's video i'm going to be showing you footage from when i found my wedding dress if you guys do not know recently got married in october i documented all of my wedding dress shopping so i will have i have two videos i tried on a lot of dresses so i will have those linked up here down there everywhere and i also wanted to show you some other footage that nobody has seen before because i had to keep my dress a secret so if you guys want more of like wedding dress experience and be trying on a bunch of dresses you can go check out those videos but if you want to know more like behind the scenes process and kind of what went in to finding my dress and my genuine reactions and all that stuff then this is the video for you so the first clip that i'm showing you guys is from when i very first tried on the dress and then i think i probably want to try it with like yeah beautiful i like this neckline on you that's sweetheart i can't remember what your first i know i think it was really it's similar it's definitely somewhere the flowers are definitely much lighter and um like smaller and there's a tad bit of sparkle this is like bigger flowers do you like the color it's kind of like a nude undertone yeah i actually do like the nude undertone yeah i like it too but i think i kind of keep it yeah i like it and when it photographs too it photographs like much lighter because the flowers are so bright but i love this dress this is one of my favorite dresses over here   so i found my dress at a salon in chicago called lovely bride they have locations across the united states but chicago the chicago location i believe is the only location or maybe one of a few that carries the brand of dress that i chose so just to get this out of the way this is where the dress is from here is all the information on it the designer and all that jazzy stuff um something to note is my dress did not come with the sleeves i had those custom made by the tailor so i was actually pretty set on this dress here let me know if you need to move okay do you guys coming back from church it is a good soup are you guys on your way back from church not ready i really loved it it was almost everything i was looking for as you can see i do love off the shoulder sleeves so i would have added them to that dress as well i was about to get back into dress number one and i saw this beauty hanging up and i was like you know what i'm gonna just try that one on i thought it had a ton of personality and it was super unique which i wanted and i have some personality just like a little bit so i was like maybe i should try it on because it looks pretty special so i tried it on and i really liked it like i i loved it but i needed a little convincing um because i still was thinking about dress number one   what do you guys think   yeah we get it or so you can either line it yeah and or get the white so i actually went back and got back into my first dress and i basically just compared how i felt in both ones but the thing is when i actually got back into the first dress i was more convinced that i was gonna choose that one uh but the stylist like really loved the dress i picked um we'll just call oh it's the the flora dress i believe it's called so she really loved this flora dress on me so she encouraged me because she knew i was like a little hesitant she encouraged me to get back into that dress one more time now that i tried them on back to back so i did i got back into the other dress and then from there i was sold i really loved that dress and i just it was just different it felt a little bit different than the other one i loved them both but i ended up going with that second dress i didn't like the tulle sleeves i don't think the tool matches with the dress yeah so we were thinking about doing like the really thin spaghetti straps that you liked on     so basically they would take the extra hands on a dress like this they either would have it they would take the horse hair off in heaven and then reattach it or they take it from the middle i just know i'm not sure which one so you would have extra fabric so you would use this type of fabric oh this one is pockets oh   though posing okay let me get a picture   okay i'm just gonna squeeze i would highly recommend lovely bride i actually found my veil at the lovely bride in phoenix and they had a lot of great selection um if you guys don't know this is my veil it is so beautiful it has that nude color and those um what are they called like the crochet flowers on it and actually looks like it was made for my dress it wasn't it's from lover society so i'll also have a link to my veil in the description if you guys are interested in i thought i was gonna get a short veil kind of like the one i tried on with the dress in the beginning i really like that veil too but when i saw this other nude one it was just so unique and matched the dress like perfectly it was so long though but i ended up choosing it so i commit to the dress and i'm not gonna lie after i committed to the dress i went back and looked at the photos of other dresses i tried on and i began to psych myself out i would not recommend going back and looking at other photos or even continuing to look at other dresses because you're going to get in your head most likely some people are just 100 sure but i wasn't kyle's trying to come in hi hi finished yeah i said it was on the phone remember this very moment i am on film and you have to run in hi i'm talking to them about my wedding dress oh a beautiful wedding chest when i found it and showing them the clips of when i first tried it on oh ooh snap okay well i gotta pee bye lovely very lovely very very lovely so after i bought the dress i was having buyers remorse i was just second guessing myself thinking you know maybe i looked better in this first dress and yeah it kind of went on and on until i think it lasted maybe five days or so and then i was like you know what this is the dress i loved it i was kind of looking for reassurance from the people who were with me and yeah i was committed a few months go by i get my dress in the mail and i'll insert the footage of me reacting and opening up my dress when i first got it in guess what just happened my wedding dress is here okay i should put these scissors down i'm gonna open it oh my gosh i'm so excited you will probably be seeing this way after i get married but that's okay i'm so excited i'm gonna get my reaction opening it and trying it on for the first time since i tried it on when i was shopping so excited i cannot believe it's happening oh i get a free hanger i'm so excited wow it's beautiful oh my goodness this is it oh it's staticky oh my gosh this real life wow it's so pretty i actually haven't seen it in like natural light because the studio didn't have great lighting okay let's try it on look look at these details yeah can you zip up um help me zip up this part oh my goodness it's so beautiful   honestly i mean you don't even need the sleeves so that was the first time i had tried on my dress since um january so it had been a while so it was really nice to get back into it i then found a tailor to take my dress to and i ended up getting a good deal i know a lot of dresses the tailoring can be upwards of like a thousand dollars but because my dress was only fitted around my chest and it fit me perfectly they didn't have to do many adjustments they just had to bustle the dress and also create my sleeves so basically i really wanted off the shoulder sleeves and because my dress had a long train the tailor was able to take off flowers from the bottom and some fabric so i went in for my first fitting and she made like a form of what the sleeves would look like the shape of them i'll insert some photos now and from there she was able to just create sleeves that were detachable that seamlessly fit with the dress and i absolutely loved the way they looked i'm pretty sure it cost me about 250 dollars to add those sleeves so to me it was worth it to add those unique that unique piece to it the sad part is you get your dress in the mail and then it's like your new baby and then you have to give it away for months to be tailored so that was kind of sad but got my dress tailored and then i went in to my final fitting and that is when i will insert the next footage of when i tried it on your hair down yeah i'm doing like a half yeah probably like here okay i'm going to turn isn't it doesn't the color match so perfectly for the applique yeah i like matching it it looks like it's for this dress and they go really well with vanilla like i could even like script it yeah i could even like do yeah this is chunky so what you do you have your bride's name with the best eyebrows get you sorted and what i'm doing yeah it's so cute is there anything else you'd like to do while we were in your dress today you should be able to sit in it just fine i'm not even worried sitting wisely so is it fair to say that your dress matched who you are just perfectly yeah what were your thoughts on my dress so first thing i saw your dress and i said wow i said it's different it's unique but it's so you mm-hmm and it was so beautiful and you my dear were so beautiful thank you that like i don't know i think like i don't know if it's like the dress was beautiful or you wearing the dress made it beautiful mm-hmm but overall it was just like oh amazing i mean i just remember i saw you and then it was waterworks and i just broke down but i was like oh my gosh that's my wifey um you're so sweet thank you yeah good to hear your opinion yeah it was a great dress thanks awesome fine thank you now you'll get to see the behind the scenes footage sweet i love you you're leaving no i'm leaving okay bye guys have fun without me love you love you have a

thing i got that kyle was referring to earlier when he said he's very fond of is this like red sexy robe it is really pretty high quality um if you are looking for a bridesmaid robe this would be a good option they also have it in different colors and it definitely isn't as cheap as like some of the other robes from amazon that i've seen the quality is really nice and it's also super comfy so i

we are right thoughts of a dog to be perfectly clear i love you it's a 20 21 calendar ello everyone welcome back to my channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne and i make lifestyle videos relationships stuff um and faith related videos like this one so uh if you guys are interested in any of that stuff just you know you can subscribe anyway before i get into today's video i wanted first to wish everyone a happy new year and a merry christmas i know i've been kind of m.i.a lately i was spending time with family but i just want to say how much i appreciate all of you and i just pray everyone had an amazing time celebrating the gift of jesus because that is what christmas is all about and i also just wanted to say a special thank you to everyone who has joined this community and family in the year 2020 i know so many of you found my channel in 2020 and you guys have just been so amazing like the best subscribers anyone could ever have you guys are always so kind and supportive and constructive so thank you to all of you even the people who leave the hate comments god bless you um i think i'm not words of affirmation so i often forget to express um how much i care for people verbally it doesn't come naturally so i'm trying to do that more because i know a lot of you probably are words of affirmation and yeah i think it is cool to know your friends love languages just so they can receive love in that way too so i guess in that sense leave your love language in the comments and i can get to know all of you guys better and i can figure out how i can show you appreciation and love so i know during this time there's probably a lot of like new year's resolution videos and goal setting videos which is awesome however god really put it on my heart to do some spiritual resolutions for this next year i have kind of come up with a list of things that i want to implement in my life but i also started brainstorming a ton of other ideas that i probably um i'm not going to be doing so but i wanted to share anyway so yeah i think man i think above any goal you could set this year the best one you could ever set is to become closer with jesus because he really is just the best um he is literally the reason why i have joy and why i met kyle and why i'm so content even in hard days and yeah he's just so good so during this time of setting new intentions i encourage everyone to have jesus at the top of their list and i wanted to share some creative ways to do that before we actually get in i just want to have like a quick like spiritual life update i haven't been making many like spiritual videos lately for months actually and that was because i felt like god was just calling me into a really really like personal time with him where i wasn't sharing publicly um as much and honestly it has been a struggle navigating a relationship with a human and a relationship with the lord so i don't know please pray for me we are trying to figure out how to love jesus with everything we have while still loving the other person and obviously it starts with jesus if you just focus on jesus he'll help you love your spouse and everybody else but i think it's easy when you're engaged and getting married to really just look at each other so much more than you're looking at jesus the bad habit so if any of you guys are at that state make sure you keep jesus at the center of your relationship but that is a long tangent but basically want to say my faith has been a roller coaster and definitely not at its strongest if i'm being honest but that's okay we all go through these things and the trier i don't know if you guys can hear let me shut the door i think people in 2020 definitely felt that um they were far from god which is totally understandable and we all go through things like that so i just want to encourage you to not let the devil condemn you during those times um but really just think and reflect on things you could do moving forward to help you maintain your relationship with jesus more but we all go through those times and i wanted to share a quote that one of my friends sent me that really encouraged me when i felt like i was going through a really dry season with the lord so when we are in moments of desolation let us not be deceived by the evil one for desolation is not the absence of god but merely the absence of his consolations in moments of desolation may we instead rejoice rejoice that our lord does not feel the need to constantly remind us of his presence and of his love for us for it is because of god's trust in our unwavering faith and trust in him that we experience these moments in the desert desolation is one of the greatest gifts from heaven for there is no greater test of faith than when one feels as though god is not with him know this my children you are never separated from the father's loving sight for our very existence is proof of his love and that is by mother teresa so i absolutely love that and it was super encouraging recently when i just feel like i've been in such a dry season this year but hey we all go through it and it is a testing of our faith that produces perseverance if you allow it to so it's a beautiful gift okay so now i want to get in to the actual resolutions that you can start implementing this year and the first one is one that i will be doing our church as a church is doing a 21 day fast so kyle and i decided to fast the first hour of our day no phone no computer no distractions and really give that hour of our day to the lord so that is definitely something you could do whether it be 10 minutes 30 minutes an hour five hours so whatever you want to do and that doesn't necessarily mean only be reading your bible for an hour it could be meaning like 15 minutes of prayer 10 minutes of worship 15 minutes of bible time and 10 minutes of reading a god-centered book so you can you know use this time to spend with jesus in any way you want get creative with it i know i'm someone who you know routine would really help me be more grounded but at the same time i get really bored of routine too so switching up that hour every day and playing around with it definitely helps me the next discipline you can put into place is establishing your secret place and committing a certain amount of time in it each day so i was honestly like so confused what a secret place was i thought it was like this like crazy thing but turns out it's just like a place in your house that you go alone and spend time with the lord so you can have your secret place anywhere i actually have never had a secret place kyle and i really want to establish our secret place and commit whether that's 10 minutes 15 minutes whatever it is um to just be in the habit of literally listening for jesus's voice and praying to him um alone so that is something you can implement another discipline is spend five to ten minutes before bed on your knees in prayer i think actually getting on the ground and getting on your knees is a very humbling way to pray i also encourage everyone to pray out loud it helps me stay much more focused on what i'm talking about where as when i pray in my head i kind of can get like off track a lot so yes i would encourage you to spend some time before bed on your knees praying the next discipline is pray for others on a daily basis and you can do this in a few different ways i actually read a verse this morning in first timothy i will have it right here but it just talks about how god wants us to be praying uh for the on god wants us to be praying on others behalf praying and giving thanksgiving and supplications and interceding on other people's behalf so i would encourage you every day to pick a friend a family member a stranger you passed on the street and just be praying for them throughout your day and i know when i first became a christian i didn't really realize how simple praying is like it doesn't need to be this formal thing i only do when i wake up or go to bed kyle was a really great example of this he just showed me that you can be praying constantly like while you're out and about while you're in the car you can literally say two sentences to god like today in pilates class i was next to a woman who was pregnant so i said like a short prayer for her baby and that she would come to know the lord and that her baby would be a follower of jesus and like it's just those little moments where you can be like oh wow i just passed this person in the store and i can just say a quick prayer for them another discipline you could start implementing is a worship session one day a week or how often you want to do it um this is something kyle and i did when quarantine started because churches were shut down and worship was a really powerful thing for our relationship with god so we would just blast music and have a little worship session whether it was like 30 minutes or an hour and yeah we would just be worshipping in the bedroom that sounds really wrong but you guys know what i mean i'm not you know you know what i mean okay asking god to help you grow in a certain characteristic or trait every day or fruit of the spirit so let's say you really want to grow in self-control um throughout your day just continuously pray and ask god to help you with self-control lately i've been asking god to help me respect kyle and support him and love him and convict me on those things and it's so cool because over the past day god keeps bringing things to my attention that i need to say differently or things i need to express or not express um so yeah pray intentionally for god to work on a certain characteristic every week every day every month you can change the focus and you can always ask god to reveal what he wants you to work on as well a another spiritual discipline that you can do this year is going for prayer walks this is something i used to do also during quarantine and it's definitely something i want to start doing again but that is literally just going outside enjoying god's creation and his fresh air and just be praying you could also do this for worship you could go for a worship walk where you just walk around listen to worship music and just like be worshipping jesus but you can also go for a prayer walk where you're just walking around and like you're audibly praying to god as you walk and a beautiful thing you can do is bless the neighborhood you're walking through bless the people you pass like just say pray prayers for everybody and anybody and plead the blood of jesus every step you take so that is something that really helps me focus during prayer and feel super intimate um with god there's just something about walking while you're praying that keeps me focused i don't know physically calling or texting someone to pray for them whether you do this on a daily basis or weekly basis but call up your friends your family message a stranger on facebook or someone you knew from high school and just ask how you can pray for them and then literally pray for them like send them a voice memo or call them on the phone or if you can't do those you can always write out the prayer for them but instead of just saying okay i'll pray for you and you're doing it in your quiet time um actually vocalize or write out the prayer because that can be very powerful okay another thing you could start doing in 2021 is to pray in your car rides so like i was saying kyle was such an amazing example for praying a lot and um this morning on my way to was it this morning now it was yesterday i think instead of listening to music or podcasts i just went in silence and just prayed audibly and like talked to god while i was driving and yeah that's like an easy way you can dedicate one drive a day to praying so that's something you could do if you have to commute anywhere just dedicate one drive to just prayer lord do you have any more disciplines for us that we could be doing obviously some other disciplines could be reading um you know your bible every day there is something called daily audible bible dab it's an app and they go through the whole bible in a year you listen to it like like an audio recording so that is something you could do every day oh another thing you could do this year is memorize one bible verse a week i know that is something i want to get better at because i am not very good at memorizing bible verses so another discipline you can do is doing a devotional every morning that's always a great way to start your day and something i like to do is when i read the devotional they usually have a reference verse and i usually then go to that verse in the bible that way i'm just like not only reading devotionals which is created by man man that way i'm not only reading from you know humans perspective but i'm actually taking the verse they're talking about and looking it up in the bible and then studying a few verses around it or the context of it and that is a great way to get in the word that's not very intimidating because you have a devotional of someone's human opinion kind of leading you through but then you also go reference the bible verse and expand on what they are talking about some other random things you could do are um listening to a sermon every morning or while you're in the shower um listening to sermons as you're driving somewhere i know when i first became a christian i used to listen to sermons when i got ready i literally would listen to like three sermons a day and i seriously reflect back now and i'm like i wonder why i'm in such a dry season and i'm like kian you're not doing anything you used to do you're not like listening to these sermons on a daily basis you're not in the word as much you're not praying as much so like girl let's like get to work let's do something let's you know what i'm saying another thing that i would love to do especially when i was single was go on jesus dates so this is something you could do you could do once a month twice a month where you just go somewhere on a date with jesus i used to go to a coffee shop or go get tacos and i would just bring my bible and just enjoy some time with the lord out in public and that was really fun i think i actually should probably start doing that again like even in marriage you need to continue to date jesus because it's hard to date your husband if you're not dating jesus first so that is something i'm just getting so exp inspired by all of these disciplines and then another thing you can do is sing songs to jesus and i like to do this when i'm like driving in the car and i'll literally just like let spirit lead and basically like sing out a praise like praising him and thanking him and asking him to help me and i just sing it in a little tune and yeah it's just it's just a sweet fun thing to do speaking of praising jesus that is another discipline you could start is implementing just like five minutes a day where you literally just thank jesus for everything he's done in your life and you praise him for who he is and what he's doing and just everything he did on the cross i think that is kind of like a christian's version of gratitude great okay i just listed off i think like a million disciplines if you guys have any ideas please leave them in the comments so everyone can get inspiration from each other if you want to start implementing any of these disciplines let me know in the comments which ones you are going to commit to and with all of this i know personally i get very overwhelmed when it comes to discipline and goals and i think if i miss one day or i i don't follow through like if i set a daily goal but i miss a day or two i really get off track and the enemy definitely uses that to condemn me and make me feel really bad about myself and discouraged so with all of this being said i want to encourage all of you that we are not perfect jesus you know didn't come and die for us to be perfect he knew we were flawed and sin and that occasionally we would not um follow through and i just want to say have a little bit of grace for yourself not too much grace where you're just like whatever but have a little grace where you know if you miss a day you're not gonna like give up because that's something i used to do or i would just set like these really unrealistic goals that were like mountains i was trying to climb when i hadn't even walked 20 minutes you know does that make sense anyway i hope you guys enjoy this video and yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video and god bless you and i love you guys but jesus loves you more never forget that i love you all and i will see you in my next video good morning i'm a little sick if you can't hear it in my voice i'm whispering kyle wasn't in bed this morning and i came out here and look you think you spent all night sleeping next to me oh good morning   this is the cutest thing ever you want to go sleep in the bed i know it's okay i can't clean i love that he allows us to hold him like this just a cradle bug look at his leg are you being a troublemaker dad's just trying to clean up and he's just tearing up my opportunity anything that moves he will chase after watch he makes a mess i go cleaning and he attacks did he just fart no that was him   it's the morning you get 40 at night i get 40 in the morning that's the truth so now we're just breaking down his pen because we usually just set that up at night hey play with your duck are you are you kidding are you gonna let me put that in the vlog or should i refrain handsome it was fake he loves this duck anyway good morning welcome to this vlog handsome oh my gosh i cannot wear these sweatpants because they are flowy and move and this kid has figured out how to get up on the couch he's getting so big and learning so much we've only had him for what five days now he's just the best dog ever he's just a puppy he's just a puppy so we know he's not gonna be perfect like that he is always have a toy around if he's biting something he's not supposed to give him something he can bite but mostly he wants things that are attached to our bodies like this phone but i wanted to vlog today and introduce you to our puppy if you haven't seen um we wanted to introduce you to our dog um we made a full video on the cayenne and kyle channel so if you want to see like all the footage of us picking him out and deciding and just being super weird um yeah and picking him up and his first day here go to that channel i'll have it linked up here and you can watch all that but i haven't introduced him on this channel yet so yes this is handsome i literally have wanted a golden retriever named handsome since i was like 16 i think i remember i saw a golden retriever in someone's backyard when we were taking homecoming photos and i was like oh my gosh like even when they're old they're just so handsome and ever since then i've been determined to get a golden retriever named hansa and my dreams have come true so i figured i would just kind of vlog today and show you a day in the life with our new puppy i woke up at 9 30 or 9 40. so he was sleeping till then but like you saw kyle was out here so well he was not sleeping yeah he wasn't doing very good last night but we also responded to every time he whined but kyle was just trying to make sure i could sleep since i wasn't feeling well when you're laying next to him he settles down really quick yeah so occasionally that's what we'll do if he if we think he's ready to get out of his pen but we want to sleep a little longer we'll just come out here and like lay our head next to him and then he like doesn't feel anxious anymore yeah and then start sleeping so we don't take him out when he whines because we don't want him to think like oh if you whine you get to get out of your bed but we just try to settle his anxiety he's in a new place and he's used to sleeping with like eight other puppies so we're just trying to be considerate this first first week and he is very well potty trained which is like the biggest blessing ever because like you you can see we're allowing him on our couch our carpet and that's because he knows right he knows if he has to go he comes to his pen or his litter box is what we call it this is what what oh no this is what the breeder had for them when they were puppies so they're already trained to use it so instead of trying to switch to pee pads we just got the same thing it's basically just horse pellets horse pellets like horse bed angry or horse pellets i don't know yeah hey say when you're potty training that basically anytime your dog has an accident it's your fault so we go by that rule um and it's just because we weren't paying attention to him we didn't take him outside enough um so yes we take him out two to three times every hour but he also knows to go in his litter box too and the only times he's had accidents was he was whining in his crate and we didn't let him out and then the other times were um we just weren't paying attention ideally you would want to keep the dog on like a house leash so you could have him like within eight feet of you at all times so we do have one of those but he's been so good that we don't always use it it's hard to tell there's like three drips literally drips sometimes he fakes us out so he can get a tree right so i'm applying this breathe again oil from young living i'm just putting it on my neck and my chest it's basically like a natural vicks that's what it smells like and it just helps because i'm like really stuffy right now so all right it's handsome breakfast time right now we're transitioning him off of kibble and onto the raw diet so yummy we're gonna take half of a patty and mix it in with the kibble that the breeder gave us and in case you're interested i'll show you what one we got we would suggest going to your local pet store if you're interested in this and asking them for advice because they're typically like super knowledgeable on their products but yes we didn't want to give handsome any kibble um there is a really good documentary called i think it's called pet food so if you're interested in learning more we also um follow dr becker's recommendations this is the one we decided to get for him it is made of lamb these are the ingredients so no crazy stuff that you can't read it's just all organic meat and veggies somebody's excited and then we typically take a little bit at a time and we hand feed it to him so he can learn as he as he eats and he he'll be trained and it also is good that he won't be possessive over his food good boy so by doing this twice a day he's already learned how to sit down he knows his now he knows his name good boy um we're teaching him um stay so and this also like makes him work a lot harder for his food so with dogs you would think that exercising outside and running around is what tires of mouth the most but what really tires them out the most is using their brain so we try to do like little training sessions and things like this like he has to use his brain to get his food and this tires him out so fast so after he eats he'll probably last another like hour maybe and then he'll take another nap but he's so good good boy yes yes good job looks like i am the grand master trainer we've been watching queen's gambit oh yeah um you're already doing it good boy sit yes okay stay you have to start smaller sit stay yes so you don't want them to have multiple fails in a row so they say to us um set them up for success before you try something too hard for them so like kyle was stepping too far back and he kept missing the mark so then you want to start from a place where he can get rewarded again yes handsome stay yes do it so really when it comes down to it it's never the dog's fault it's always yours yeah that's what we're learning yeah when it comes to training partying whatever it's our fault yeah yeah so we never like rub his nose in his pee or anything like that if he starts peeing somewhere he shouldn't we run him to where he's supposed to be because they don't understand yeah i feel like he kind of does he's a little sneaky because he knows where to go to get a treat he goes and he does a little couple jerks with his wizard and then he comes to us like look what i did yeah but then over here there's something about carpet that dogs like to pee on yeah he hasn't peed on on this floor but on the carpet he has twice yeah he's like big dad yes if you guys are curious where i learned all of this um it's from a youtube channel called rachel facero um also there's one called zach's zach george dog training so i mean there's hundreds of videos on youtube for dog training and like i said in the um in our other video i've watched hours and hours and hours of dog training videos so that's why i learned all of this stuff um before we got him that's what i would do is watch tons of videos and it's really painful you can teach your dog to sit or do whatever but if you can't do it while he's distracted then it's really not as efficient so handsome down well he's with kyle i go we're running   that's another big one is like coming when he's called especially when he's distracted so that will come in handy when he's a little bit older and can go outside on walks or play at a park we know he will still come to us when we call him even if some lunatics running around with the duck screaming okay it's a little bit later i'm still feeling pretty sick but i'm gonna get ready in a little bit but since i last saw you i actually am a part of this adobe creator camp they invited me to be a part of it and basically they're like teaching us things about adobe premiere and editing with it and i use final cut pro so i'm interested to see you know the differences and if it would be beneficial for me to switch over so i'll just finish that and now we are waiting for mr ryan chen to go live on our couple's channel he is doing a live on prophecy because we've had so many questions on spiritual gifts and prophecy ryan was somebody who went live in our proverbs 31 day challenge twice and he is just so blessed in the prophetic and all of his words are very accurate he actually prophesied over kyle and i when we first went to church for the nations before he ever knew us or knew anything about us now he's teaching you guys on prophecy and we're just happy to extend our platform to him because we know this isn't something people talk about a lot when it comes to christianity and it's in the word of god so it's something we should talk about and it says to earnestly seek to prophesy so yeah we want to encourage everyone to earnestly seek as i mean i want to prophesy amen yeah for sure we should all want to practice that exactly so um that will be up by the time you're watching this video so if you guys are interested in that i will have a link or a card somewhere here and yeah it's about to start so we're really excited person what do you love um about this person and i might get a picture or an image or or something of like oh my gosh this person i feel like this person loves to be outdoors and then i might say you know talk to this person and be like hey do you love to be outdoors yes awesome something else i might ask the lord is you know what did what gifts and talents did you place inside of this person before they were born in their mother's womb what was your original design for this person these are two questions i think i almost always ask the lord when i'm prophesying over someone because these are i think prophesying is it's meant to it's meant to pull out the original design of the way that like god created we just finished up the live and it was so good so if you guys want to watch it it was extremely powerful and informational so i will have that linked i wanted to show you a package that just came in these boys are playing on the couch i'm going to take you into the bedroom so i wanted to show you a package that i just got in the mail i am super excited to be working with orate on this video thank you to them for sponsoring as you guys know i do love high quality jewelry um i don't like buying a bunch of cheaper pieces that are only going to last a couple months i would prefer to buy a really nice ring for example that i never have to take off and won't discolor rust and that is why i love ori is because their pieces are such high quality they even have a lifetime guarantee which is amazing that's just goes to show how much confidence they have in their pieces and they are all made with real gold so you never have to take them off you can shower in them cook clean play sports in them all of the above and they will maintain their shine um so yeah let's see what i got this is the box that they sent me this packaging is so beautiful i'm obsessed with it and then inside they also sent this really beautiful pouch to store your jewelry in and these are the things that i ordered i'm trying to stock up on some like really beautiful rings that will last me a long time and that are timeless so i got three rings this one is pretty tiny so you can wear it on your knuckles this one is my favorite it's definitely a statement piece but i think it is so gorgeous this was one of my favorite things it is an ear cuff they have some really beautiful cuffs on their website and um i've been really sad because i haven't been able to wear earrings in this ear um because i have kind of like an infection near one of my ear holes so i was really excited that they had a cuff because it's a really simple way to dress up the ears without actually wearing earrings this is what all of the rings look like on they are seriously so pretty these are some of my favorite pieces i have in my collection now and i know that they're gonna last so long so if you guys are interested in shopping any of these pieces or some of their other collections you can go to the website or at new york dot com slash cayenne tilton and use the code kai and tilton for 15 off and ora is spelled a u r a t e new york dot com slash kai and tilton so i will have those links in the description so they're easy to access and again my code is cayenne tilton for 15 off thank you again to orate for sending me these beautiful pieces so so excited that i got to work with them um now i'm gonna move on to probably i think cleaning um i really need to do laundry so all of that is actually clean i can't be the only one but i don't know why i always procrastinate putting away clothes and then it starts piling up and gets really overwhelming and i know it would only take like 10 minutes but i don't know and then when my room gets messy i feel like super cluttered in my head like mentally so i definitely need to just like pick up the room and make the bed kyle has been nice enough to stay home today to help me get things done for work with the dog it's a little bit harder to get things done so it's nice to have somebody who can play with him and get all that energy out while the other one is working how are y'all doing oh my goodness what did he do i mean he looks like a peaceful little teddy bear right now but this entire time this entire time sniffing and jumping around and running around trying to jump on the table oh my gosh now he looks so peaceful i know independent this entire time he's been crazy i'm over here like stop like i need to just relax he wouldn't sit he wouldn't lie he was jumping running biting yeah i'm just like because he's playful he just slept for like four or five hours he needs you to look at him yeah i've been trying to get him to do this this entire time he hasn't done it this is his bully stick and he loves it it's great for dogs to chew on you can get them at your local pet store typically so it's been a couple hours kyle and i just had a meeting with somebody about hallelujah blue which i actually changed the name of so i'm vlogging the whole process of launching the business um so that will be in another video but we just had a meeting about getting some of the clothes manufactured and kind of just figuring out how to best do that we're hoping to launch it within a few months and like i said in a previous video i have somebody um working on the branding and website right now uh which is another thing i need to get done is just typing out all of the website content which is pretty tedious so yeah that is what we've been doing we're gonna get this munchkin fed it's so cute anytime i come into the kitchen he'll come like lay by my feet um he just loves to be close to us loves to lay by us so we're gonna get him fed six o'clock which we usually like to feed him between 5 30 and 6 and then it's mission impossible which is basically keeping him up and like running around for the next two three hours so he can get super tired we might even start later today because he still hasn't been going to sleep maybe we can get him to stay up till like nine or nine tonight that would be to yeah that would be the goal and then we're probably going to cook some dinner all day i don't know yeah we don't know what's going on but he started his first snap at 11 and then was basically sleeping on and off until like 4pm of course attacking me in between but what do you want to say   oh baby's scared what's going on bud he's so tired what's going on that's all you want belly rubs yes you do yes you do the cutie here it is oh oh there it is so cute nice stretch oh you got it here kaboom kyle and i tried this dip from trader joe's for the first time so did handsome oh gosh it's really good that was the first people food but he didn't actually have some he just went to he went to lick it he looked like he got his whole face in it yeah handsome hasn't had any people food not yet anyways i would recommend this it's very good   it can't you're so cute i can't take it all right shall we feed our boy i think it's time to feed our boy okay so i'm teaching handsome his place and he does it in like the cutest way ever so let's show them let's show them he like dives onto his bed place it's the cutest little hop ever i just ordered this like treat couch belt on amazon and it's been very handy to have while he's learning place yes good boy all right come on please every time every time just a big hop good boy good boy let's see if you stay stay yes yes yes yes stay there please sit yes please yes oh my god the bunny hop the bunny hop is so good all right ellen i just ordered chipotle so we're gonna go grab some i'm gonna stay in the car um just go grab it for pickup and we're leaving handsome here alone we i don't think we've really left him besides at nighttime not for more than five minutes so we want to practice like leaving for really short periods of time so he doesn't like associate it with too much trauma because a lot of people will like leave their dog in their crate and then go for hours but we want to slowly just do like five minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes so this should take us like 20 minutes so yeah and he's pretty tired so we're gonna let him nap come home and then i think we decided we're just gonna have to do another play session later tonight at like nine because he's not staying awake anymore and it's seven so it's pretty early for him to go to bed we'll get out of here all right it is the next day and i just wanted to wrap up this vlog i hope you enjoyed just seeing a little behind the scenes of like the first couple days with our new dog last night was honestly really exhausting more for kyle because he was out with handsome but he was not being a good boy he was yelping so much and barking so pray for us yeah death cry like if i was a neighbor and i heard this dog at night i would think somebody like a woman is just being murdered wow that's morbid it was it was messed up yeah i was like bro listen you're going to be okay and he was crying like it was him he attacked my plant mister that is so sad that's life that's life that is our good dog you just you just you just took a life hey come here buddy all right guys i hope you

today who doesn't love a good q a i know they are my favorite videos this q a specifically i am trying to only answer questions that i have avoided or that i have like never talked about so i asked you guys on instagram i haven't gone through the questions yet i'm a bit nervous so we'll see how this goes you guys know i'm pretty much an open book so i'm so gonna be surprised if there are a lot of questions that i actually genuinely have been avoiding i'm excited to say that i am partnering with tula for this video so thank you to them for sponsoring so if you guys haven't heard of tula they are a doctor founded skincare brand skin care and wellness they have clean ingredients and 100 of the products are formulated with probiotics and superfoods and i was really surprised at how quickly i saw a difference in my skin i think it was the third or fourth day i noticed a pretty significant difference in the texture and just like overall health and glow of my skin oh hi handsome oh no no no no tubeless products are cruelty free and never tested on animals so yeah me and handsome really like that we are in full support some of my favorite products that i have been using from tula are one they're purifying cleanser this is what it looks like first things first it's a huge bottle i feel like you get so much product for your money it has been working great on my skin my skin's responding to it very well and i feel like it gives me a really deep clean so love that the next thing i've been using is their moisturizer it's a 24 7 moisturizer my skin has been really dry lately and i've been using a very expensive moisturizer for months now and i just feel like i'm not seeing a difference in my skin it's still getting dry and then i tried this i mean you can see in the consistency alone it's a super like thick cream handsome as you can see it's a really thick cream and it has done a an amazing job of moisturizing my face i love this so i would highly recommend i have noticed seriously within three two or three days i noticed my skin was so much more moisturized so i would highly recommend that oh my goodness oh my goodness okay if you're gonna be in my sponsorship you have to support me by just being a cute right here okay so if you guys want to try any of tula's products you can go to the link in the description and use the code cayenne for 15 off again that is tula.com and i will have all the information in the description but for now let's just get into this video because it has been a journey oh my goodness he just had my coffee how cute is this mug from target side note but oh lord oh what am i gonna do hey google can dogs have coffee on the website petinsurance.com they say coffee beans grounds and brewed coffee contain caffeine a very dangerous and toxic chemical to cats and dogs ingestion can be life-threatening oh my gosh okay are you gonna die on me now i just i pray healing over you protection in jesus name handsome okay it is a little while later thankfully there's just like a little bit of light left in this day we have handsome he's settling in nicely finally ready to take a nap so okay you guys are starting off strong the first question is since you both had a sexual past did you get tested before getting married um no we did not i honestly didn't even think of that we did talk about if any either of us had had any stds before while we were dating or engaged it was one of the questions in the 101 questions to ask before you get engaged um book that we have so if you guys are interested in that i'll have it linked in the description but one of them was like do you guys have any health conditions or like anything like that that you guys need to talk about before getting engaged so we did talk about it and neither of us had at least from our knowledge and so yeah we still i guess we still don't really know but yeah i have been tested once in my life and i didn't have anything so i guess i just based my knowledge on that test the next question is do you have any beef with other youtubers um no i think something i've been struggling with lately and you guys please pray for me is comparison and like kind of like being competitive and like comparing my views and subscribers and growth and stuff to other youtubers so yeah i don't have any beef with any of them but that is definitely i was going through like a hardcore season of just comparison so if you guys could pray for me on that i am like praying about it a lot and doing my best to kind of just like release that i think we are raised to be competitive people so it's almost like an instinct for us to just compare ourselves in that way but i really don't want to like put any of my worth or value in views because it's not even about views each person who watches my videos is not like a view they are a person and i shouldn't turn people into views or followers does that make sense i hope it does my journey with body image since becoming a christian or a wife i talked a lot about about body image in my like get healthy with me videos um it's actually really surprisingly it's actually really surprising because i haven't struggled with body image like hardly at all since getting married or like leading up to the wedding i think i just finally was like you know what this is my body and i can definitely work out and be more healthy but at the end of the day like this is just my body and i just need to love it for where it's at and what it is because like god gave me this body and like it's really not that big of a deal like it's really not a huge deal what our body looks like obviously you want to be healthy but it's really not that serious and i just got to this point where i was like cool like this is my body that's it like i don't need to focus on changing it and i think the leading up to the wedding i was really focused on it and then the few months before the wedding where people usually work out the most i was just like whatever like i don't care someone asked did you have to make boundaries with your friends after you became a christian   oh like talking about guys are going out partying i don't think i like set specific boundaries but over time it kind of happened where i kind of stopped talking about sex and pre-marital sex i don't ask my friends about their sex lives especially if they're not married so that is kind of like a boundary as far as going out and partying when i first became a christian i still went out i still went to the bars and over time i started going less and then i over time i just stopped getting drunk um so i would maybe have it one drink or a lot of times i would go to the bars or go out dancing sober um and now i'm at a point where i just do not want to go to a bar or club how come you and kyle moved in before you were married yes this is something i've avoided talking about i actually have never talked about this on our channel because we had said we weren't gonna like fully live together so we had been living with our basically like an aunt and uncle we were living with them in separate rooms for a while leading up to the wedding and that just you know god opened the doors for us to do that and it wasn't causing us to struggle or stumble in any way so that was great um but then after that what we chose and not to talk about on youtube was we ended up getting our apartment and living in the apartment together before we got married and kyle slept on the couch every night which was like god bless his soul for doing that because we stepped we stuck with our boundaries and i think so many people were like uh i don't know if you should do that like it could lead to a lot of temptation but i don't know kyle and i just really did not struggle with that so yeah we were living in the same apartment and he was sleeping on the couch every night and if i could go back and do it differently i think i would and i definitely would not advise that for everybody i know that would just be way too far for a lot of people and it might really lead a lot of people to sin and obviously that was the main reason why we chose not to disclose that information was because we we knew that people were maybe like looking for us to be an example of something and we just knew that specific example would definitely not work for everybody and probably not work for most of people and we wouldn't recommend it to people so yeah i don't know that's just something we have never really talked about and obviously i'm going to talk to kyle before i post this to make sure he's okay that i share this but it was just something we knew would add like maybe an extra layer of criticism and that's just not something we wanted to endure through engagement because it was already such a hard season as it was so yeah that was a personal decision that we made and yeah that's that what is yours and kyle's main source of income right now our main source of income is youtube and social media collaborations and then our second source of income is kyle he does doordash and instacart right now we are hoping to build our platforms and youtube channels to be consistent enough to maintain us however um youtube kind of like fluctuates and it's not as stable as we would like so that is why he's still working on that have you ever struggled with masturbation or pornography um i don't think i would consider it a struggle have i done those things and watch those things when i was in like middle school or high school i think yes but it's not something i ever like was really interested in doing like i just i don't know i just like didn't struggle with it i guess only by the grace of god so thank you jesus for that but yeah honestly it just wasn't something i struggled with and i know a lot of people do so yeah my heart goes out to you praying for you and i struggle with so many other things so i don't think one struggle is like worse than the other struggle you know someone said you don't like reading and responding to all your dm's um that was actually something i really struggled with the past few months i i should repent my heart has been in a bad place recently towards dms i really was focusing more on the negative and like harsh messages and comments over like the loving ones and that's so easy to do but that was something i really struggled with so i i kind of got to this point where i just stopped looking at them because it was just it was building up like a lot of like resentment in my heart and i've recently really come to that realization and repented for it and have been really working on going through my messages again and just loving people especially the people who comment like really really mean and rude things like i'm just asking god to help me love them i feel like i've just been taking you guys for granted and almost like punishing the people who are really loving and caring and supportive because of the people who are not and like regardless of any of that even if i did get like thousands of hate messages like i should still love those people anyway like we're supposed to love our enemies so i'm sorry for all the people who sent hateful messages who i didn't love and who i felt resentful towards because i should love you guys too because jesus loves you and i'm called to share that love with you so yeah forgive me father okay next video next video next question spending habits and journey with money oh my goodness i should make a whole video on this because i used to binge spend i had a lot of credit card debt like thirty thousand dollars of credit card debt when i was in college and i would just blow through money i just like had no sense of saving and like no self-control and it was a way that i would like deal with emotions i remember that i got um there was like a bad breakup and i literally went and bought like 900 shoes emotional spending like so unnecessary on a credit card i didn't even have the money so let me just tell you i've been through a journey my heart goes out to anybody who struggles with that i know it's so hard but let me tell you god can redeem it and he has really helped me with my spending impulsive spending and saving i think something that really helped me was starting to tithe because it just helps you be unattached from money because you it's not yours anyways it's the lord like everything we have here on earth is because of jesus and his mercy when something happens when you're a child how much it can impact you because i know why i'm like this it's because i don't remember ever having this much like of an urge to spend until this one moment in middle school where one of my best friends stole money from me and then from that moment forward i never saved money in my like my whole life since middle school because having money on my dresser and just like not being like feeling like i needed to spend it on something and then it being stolen programmed me to think that keeping my money was not safe so it's crazy how just like a little moment like that in our life can impact us in so many ways and lead to thousands and thousand dollars of debt and bad decisions so um should christians go clubbing and or drink alcohol just curious to see where y'all stand um well obviously in the bible it says to not drink wine and get drunk so i don't believe that christians should be drinking if they are convicted by the word and honestly i think naturally over time that desire just goes away lisa did for me so yeah that's where i kind of stand on that um i do still have a glass of wine but i think it's just to the point where it's like if it alters your decisions or makes you stumble or anything like that and obviously you feel drunk like there should be some kind of boundary in that i think and then as far as clubbing i still went to the bar sober and i don't think going to a bar is a sin like it doesn't say that in the bible but there are parts in the bible where it says like to not keep the company of that so i don't think it's something you know i would be doing on a regular basis i used to go to the country bar specifically and just like go and dance and i would tell people about jesus while i was there so i think you know people in the clubs especially need to hear about jesus so i guess just pray on it personally nowadays i would not be going to a club i just don't have an interest in doing that whatsoever i also don't really have an interest in being drunk so yeah someone wants to know she's like i don't know if you've been avoiding this but when would you like to get pregnant if i could choose when i got pregnant it's hard to say right now but i would probably say in like two or three years i really want to enjoy marriage i mean even just having this little munchkin who is making the sweetest noises right now he's like drinking in his sleep i don't know if you can see him even having him around makes me feel like a little claustrophobic like oh my goodness like we can't travel long term like we can't just pick up and leave like we have to think about our dog so i can't even imagine the extent of that when you have kids so with that being said i would love to be able to like really experience marriage and travel a lot more and like really just work on our communication and our foundation in christ before having kids so yeah ideally i would say in like three years but again god's plan god's timing are you secretly pregnant and hiding it like kristin johns did i just want to give a shout out to kristin johns who does not watch my videos but she did an excellent job of keeping it a secret i would have never guessed i was shocked but so happy for her and i can't envision her being mom cause she's like so sweet i always like see her as like a sister but i'm so excited to see her as a mom that'll be so nice but no i'm not pregnant so yeah someone said what's the most annoying thing about kyle and then someone else asked has kyle annoyed you so much you get seriously mad with him the most annoying thing if i like i could think of like little trivial things that he does that annoy me but if we're talking about like actual like annoyance like hardcore i would say the most frustrating thing that kyle does is he is not quick to move on from things like he really shuts down in conflict and this is something we've talked about in many other videos so you know he has already told you this from his mouth but yeah i would say that's the most frustrating thing but praise the lord he has gotten so much better at it already and i like definitely give some of that credit to well i give all the credit to all the glory to god but also we did a couple therapy sessions together and that was so helpful but ever since then he's been just got getting so good so that's a praise report but i would say that was that that is the only time i get so annoyed that it actually gets me angry because i can move on really fast but then since he's really stuck in it for like long periods of time i get fed up and then i get angry which is not okay on my end either but yeah that is what i would say oh also want to mention if you guys didn't know i do faithful counseling which is an online christian based counseling website i'll have my affiliate link in the description if that is something you're interested in highly recommend i recommend it for everybody it's so good to talk to other people about your feelings especially within a marriage having that third party non-bias opinion there it's been a godsend all right guys i hope you enjoyed this video we really addressed a lot what are you doing munchkin where are you going where are you going i hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you again to tula for sponsoring if you guys are interested remember to check the description for all that information cannot say enough good things about them so and i just love all of you guys thank you so much for your continued support and your prayers and all of your sweet messages and comments i greatly appreciate them and yeah i love you guys jesus loves you more bye this is so sweet it's so sweet it's so cute um handsome's taking a poop i have to go clean that up he's sniffing out all the tula products that i have right here okay you sniffed them all you sniffed them all now let's relax let's relax let's take a nap pull a natural ingredient and it helps restore fell off the couch oh my goodness what in the heck is this kid doing you're not a cat he tries to climb on like the tops of the couch handsome like do i need to like make him throw up now like how serious is this how much did you just have i don't think he had that much my goodness okay i think i'm gonna have to go make him throw up i don't know what to do ello everybody welcome to today's video if i'm being a little quiet it's because i have this little munchkin on top of me although sound really doesn't bother him so i probably don't have to be so quiet i am vlogging today i'm really excited because i'm getting my hair done and i haven't had my hair colored or cut in so long i actually had to trim it myself because it was just getting so crazy so i'm definitely getting some balayage put in i'll put in some inspiration here but guys i think i want to get the curtain bangs i think i want to do it i have been just loving ashley brooke her hair is just amazing i dream about it i think about her hair i would say on a daily basis and i'm just like i want to try they'll grow out my oh he's just a garbage man it's just a garbage man you can go back to sleep you can go back to sleep it's he doesn't like being on the camera okay like i was saying i think i want to try curtain bangs they can always grow back out you know what i'm saying so i haven't told kyle that i'm getting curtain bangs so i thought i would surprise him later with it but yeah i'm really excited i yeah what else do we got going on well right now i am doing my quiet time so let me show you what goes down i made my coffee this is the keep cup i got it for christmas and literally i think this is my favorite thing i got from christmas also that is from this munchkin he bit me really hard um but yes i love this keep cup i made a coffee this morning or a latte i should say and i'm reading my new morning mercies it's my favorite devotional i'll have it linked in the description it's so good if you take the cover off it looks like this but otherwise it has like a bright blue cover on it and then i have my bible um which i will read from in a little bit so i just finished up my quiet time the devotional was so good i just read first timothy and now i'm reading second timothy so i read second timothy 2 14 through 26 and it was so good um especially verse 23 through 25. so verse 23 says have nothing to do with foolish ignorant controversies you know that they breed corals and the lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone able to teach patiently enduring evil correcting his opponents with gentleness and i just thought that was so good and i feel like that verse is like so needed in today's church because so many people are just like in bondage to religion and rules and are just jumping down people's throats about uh so many things and being so quarrelsome so the bible tells us not to be if we are a servant to the lord we patiently endure evil and we correct with a gentleness and we are kind to everyone gosh that is so in today's society anyway this morning i had a meeting for hallelujah sunday and i was meeting with um our like branding person crystal and she sent us some revised concepts but i'm doing i'm showing all of that in another vlog but i just posted on instagram um to get you guys to vote again so if you don't follow me on instagram definitely do because i do post on there quite a bit um and now i'm going to probably make some breakfast i literally haven't left the couch it's probably been an hour this buddy's still sleeping but i need to leave for my hair appointment i was just um responding to a lot of messages i've been trying to get better at that if you haven't seen my last q a i kind of talked about my experience with dms lately but it's been so great to just be back in my messages responding and talking to y'all it's so refreshing oh my gosh i always touch my hair sorry if it's annoying but you know whatever some people you know what okay i need to do my makeup i think it's important to do your makeup before you get your hair done because especially if you're doing something like really different it's nice to have like everything put together once you're done so i'm gonna do my makeup i'm gonna make a quick breakfast i should probably wake up the munchkin so he can get some energy out i don't leave him for very long so i think i'm gonna leave him for an hour because kyle's gonna come home and watch him um but i need to like get him riled up and a little energy out because he just took a long nap good morning did you have a good nap yeah did you have a good nap i love you i love you i love you even when you bite me i love you um you're so cute oh thanks he's always the sweetest when he wakes up from the naps and right before he naps and then he turns into a raging monster who wants to bite everyone's face isn't that right isn't that right okay let's play for a little bit i feel like i never talk about makeup but i just wanted to show you kind of what i've been using so i've been using this face filter like as a primer and i really like that and then i've been combining these two foundations i really have been loving this tarte one it's a little light that's why i'm combining it but it gives me like a really pretty finish and then i've been using these um sponges that i got on amazon i'll try to link them so and then i use this bronzer and i've been obsessed with this blush palette those are kind of the basics that i use oh also this concealer from elf yep so that is the rundown don't judge me for what you're about to see but sometimes kyle and i well a lot of times we like to train handsome while we give him his food but sometimes if we are in the middle of doing something and we want him to get some of his energy out we will like throw little pieces of food everywhere so he can practice using his like nose and he can use his like brain and energy to eat and that way he also eats a little bit slower because he eats really fast so yeah while i finish my makeup i literally just put his food all over the floor so he could you know do something fun while i finish i forgot to show you guys what i use on my brows so i use these two products from elf they're pretty affordable this is the brow pencil and then this is wow brow the stylist actually said she would love for me to bring handsome so that's great i have a bag packed because i'm doing a photo shoot right after i get my hair done finished my makeup um i just haven't done mascara or lipstick and i figure i have to eat so i'll just i can do that when the appointment is over made it to the salon already chopped off a few inches we got friend handsome   okay it has been quite a few hours my hair is done look how short it is it feels so much lighter i feel like the color looks so good you guys can let me know what you think of the bangs i feel like they're actually perfect because i could probably style them like more like dramatic but i can tuck it behind the ear or blend it into my curls and then it'll look like i don't even have bangs but i absolutely love the color i think the length is a little short but i think it's going gonna be perfect because my hair grows so fast so it'll grow out really nicely i'll show you tomorrow in the daytime this lighting is pretty bright so it should be pretty accurate but kyle hasn't seen my hair yet so he's gonna get home soon and i'm gonna surprise him and hopefully get his reaction but after i got my hair did i met up with a photographer named gretchen and she took some photos so i'll insert them now and i will also link her instagram below if you're looking for somebody in arizona to shoot any content for you definitely hit her up and then we went and got like a smoothie afterwards it was super nice and she's so sweet so yeah i just got home apparently kyle took handsome with him to go to work doordash so he's just like the most spoiled boy ever um but yeah they should be here soon the longest four minutes of my life oh hello you heard your voices start running around the building oh really yeah looking for look at you who are you can i get your number what's your wife oh hey girl look at you it's like a whole new this yeah yeah looks good thank you yeah it looks beautiful and things you do it bangs it's very different yeah yeah but then look i can just hook it behind you they don't have any bangs that looks good you look great thanks yeah oh hi yeah i like it wow hey baby hey what's your name cayenne love gay what no that's my worst thing what's your name okay no that's my question what's your name tilted no that's my worst minion name what's your name very well yeah kyle didn't even realize that was filming no that was very tricky and typically i know when you're filming but how would you rate my new hair i really like it yeah yeah i mean is there what's it one through ten yeah eleven oh that's sweet do you like my hair better before or no no wait one he said no i said before or now oh i thought i said did you like my hair before or no like better before oh yeah what do you like better no this really yeah okay yeah this looks good on you thanks yeah it's a good look thanks not everybody could pull the bangs i like the highlights thank you it is thinner it looks like you're not carrying like 40 pounds   but no it looks really good thank you i wanted to show you guys a little amazon package that came in so i ordered some claw clips this was a three pack that i got on amazon i'll have it linked in the description i thought these would be come in handy i'm always needing a clip when i'm styling my hair but also these are very in fashion like maybe a better way to do an updo and then i ordered these no crease clips to help style my bangs and yeah so i'll have both these link below i'll let you know how i like them so what do you want picking out dinner not stuffed caprice burgers meat loaves with a sweet chili glaze i didn't think i would want meatloaf but like that kind of looks really good fully loaded pork taquitos okay come here come to daddy come to daddy oh my goodness i'm scared come on handsome come come come oh i'm so nervous it's a steep incline come on come on yes yes yes yes yes yes yes   yes yes okay let's go potty yes so we just had some dinner i was seriously so good and now we're just watching some designated survivor honestly these clips not that great they're just like super cheap i thought they were gonna be they're just like hard plastic like a guitar pick that's kind of like how they're made i thought they were gonna be like silicone or something like that and they don't hold the hair that well so hello mister hello mister i love you i love you oh oh oh what are you doing things aren't so cute anymore oh and i switch off nights of who's gonna wake up with handsome because he wakes up at seven a.m and we're used to sleeping till like nine so today was my shirt so basically i just take him out of his pen and play with him a little bit and then probably for like an hour and then i try to sleep for like another 45 minutes so i just woke up from that little nap this munchkin it gets so awkward this is what the color looks like it's so short okay i wanted to show you how i make my coffee so we have the nespresso machine if you love lattes i would highly recommend this it's so much better than the keurig i mean the cure can't even make espresso so we have espresso every day i love the taste of lattes so i will have this one linked if i can find it i'm not sure if it's still available in white so this machine in particular comes with a frother which is amazing so i typically depends how sweet i want but i'll add this chobani oat milk in vanilla and then i do this chobani sweet cream coffee creamer just like a dash of it and then i'll add some cinnamon and this really tastes like it reminds me of like a like a toasted marshmallow latte the other day i added some cacao powder to it   so if you want to get creative i should probably switch up my coffee recipe because i've been doing this for a long time so i think i'll probably get tired of it soon i don't do anything fancy i literally just take the froth milk and pour it in here should we bring dad some coffee so excited hey dad got some coffee and we got some puppy yeah something oh you want to see him puppy just bit my nose i'll kisses where are the kisses oh you're just biting me handsome that's so mean it's okay it's okay it's okay so i realized i forgot to show you guys which shampoo and conditioner i got so i i'm out of mine i typically use the living proof one and i also bought the amber filler up today which i didn't really love um i just had the conditioner sorry for my bleeding pimple i just had the conditioner of that but i still have half the bottle and i just don't like it so i'm gonna see if i can return that to sephora but they sold kevin murphy products so i bought this one this is the blonde angel wash so it's supposed to help keep my highlights bright um also the packaging is like so beautiful and then i got the repair um strengthening conditioner so i'm hoping that these will keep my hair nice and healthy and clean he loves coffee you can't drink coffee crazy dog let's see if he'll do the ramp on me i doubt it well be careful you want to get down oh don't eat my toe tony my toe just offering you a way down ouch okay never mind goodbye   he just got slain i cast out all demons in jesus name the teething demon the biting demon be gone in jesus name you are free i plead the blood of jesus over you i declare healing over you in jesus name you have no place here be gone be gone in jesus name oh you're a sweet boy now did it work did it work   praise god thank you jesus wow look at that i declare i declare protection nope oh he's back it's just moments like these that make it all worth it he's just so cute when he's sleepy he's getting so big he loves to sleep in like the most random positions and he also loves to cuddle and lay above our heads he's so cute oh did you just form anyway i love you guys jesus loves you more and i will see you in my next video bye hello everyone welcome back to my channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne and i'm so excited to be sharing this video there has been so much going on behind the scenes and i wanted to document as much as the process as possible because i love watching businessy vlogs and like the behind the scenes of what it takes to actually start a business so if you guys are interested in that this blog is going to be all about figuring out my branding and logo for the business that i'm launching so if you guys don't know i think i started working on this business two years ago and it's called it was called hallelujah blue and i recently changed the name to hallelujah sunday which you'll see some of the reasons why later in this vlog but yes i am documenting the process and to kick off the journey i really wanted to get some professional branding done for the for the company um i am a very creative person and i do believe you can like make logos yourself um and i probably would have done that but i just wanted some help so in this video i take you through the logo design and branding process i am working with a company called foundit digital i actually know crystal from an old job that i worked with her and i love her so much and she also goes to my church fun fact so i love my experience working with her and her team so if you are looking for someone to do some professional website work or branding definitely hit her up i will have a link in the description um so that's where you'll see me kind of jump into everything is our first call um seeing the first round of concepts for the logo four or five different um logos um but just to preface this we kind of comprised your mission statement as a branding experience that makes your audience feel inspired and connected to a community as they shop for stylish pieces to add to their wardrobe when we think about your brand it's really an identity that is both approachable and personal here's concept one that's cool hello everybody i wanted to quickly share my thoughts on each of the concepts that they had presented to me so this is concept number one and we just thought this word broken down was really hard to read it just did not translate well i also didn't love this symbol reminding me of a church i thought the concept was interesting overall but we just weren't really in love with it and as you can see each concept is presented with a few different formats so you have the main logo a secondary logo and a mark concept number two was this i absolutely loved this font i thought it was beautiful especially love the mark on this this h feature is so pretty however the symbol reminded me a little bit of a turtle shell or like a diamond and i didn't really connect with it and i also didn't love how the word blue gets lost the third concept looked like this this was probably one of my least favorites again with the cross it just it definitely looks like a church logo for me and i just didn't want that um also wasn't a huge fan of the font and this little box feature here this is concept 4 and again the word hallelujah broken up is pretty hard to read and also this symbol here kind of reminded me of like the medical field possibly like a nursing um logo so also did not connect with that very much and this was concept number five um the structure overall i did like i did enjoy this symbol here reminded me of the sun however this font was just super halloween for me and i did not love it this was the only concept that i asked to be carried on and i wanted to see it in a different flat option because of all of the concepts i did like this one probably the most excuse my crazy hair so as you guys saw i got the first round of logo concepts today and honestly i wasn't crazy about any of them and i think a part of that is just the name hallelujah blue is so unbalanced because hallelujah is such a long word and blue is such a short word so the difference in letters makes it really hard to design with so i've just been like collecting logo inspiration on pinterest they asked if i could send some like symbols that i really like so i compiled just a huge pinterest board of just design inspo and me being the extra and creative person that i am decided to deliver it all in a pretty packaged display so let me show you what i'm talking about program i used to create all of this was canva and i just grabbed images from social media and pinterest and dragged them in here so the first page i included a bunch of symbol inspiration i put these religious necklaces and unique crosses sun beams and stars and then also these circles half circles and arches on the second page i included more logo inspiration to just give them a bit more direction i really love how these fonts overlap and layer especially this one i think it looks really unique i do also love a really simple logo with a beautiful font and then maybe some more curved and line elements and then i also included some things that actually incorporate little symbols within it i have decided that i am like 95 sure i want to change the name of the company to hallelujah sunday sunday the day we go to church the day we rest sabbath so i don't know i really just like hallelujah it's such a hard name to say too i really like the name hallelujah sunday instead of hallelujah blue um i just there's i feel like there's such a positive associate association with the word sunday and it is a little bit longer so it would pair nicely with the word hallelujah so i think i'm gonna pull the trigger on changing the name and then since i am changing the name now i have to get a new domain i have to set up a new email address and also i need to figure out how to get the instagram handle because the instagram handle has zero followers it's super inactive no post at all so if i can get my business kind of up and running and possibly get it llc'd then i can report that account to instagram and ask them if i can take it but yeah that's an update just working on my couch so cozy right now i need to eat something though hello everybody i wanted to do a little update on halloween sunday i changed the name it is official and they got back to me with some logo new logo concept since i didn't love the first round we got my buddy handsome over here taking a nap but i wanted to show you the new concepts and then also tell you which ones are my favorite and also give you a little overview on what we're doing now moving forward for the website all right after giving them all my feedback they came back with this version too with a few different concepts so this is concept one keeping that sun element but adding in a new font we didn't really love this font and kyle kind of felt like this symbol reminded him of the sun god so we kind of explanate this one really quickly concept number two was one of our favorites we really loved this little element here because it kind of represented a sun and then tied into the word sunday one thing we are gonna have her play with is this mark here that's what they call these like small very small versions of logos that are kind of abbreviated uh we didn't love the layout of this so we've asked for some more options concept number three is this one again not a huge fan of this font and the symbol reminded me of like an eyelash or an eye and i just could not shake it after i saw it so we considered maybe swapping out the symbol for a different kind of sun but overall we liked a couple other concepts more concept number four was this one we thought this was so beautiful so classy we loved this little element here and we also thought the font was really fun but also really polished also i forgot to mention they started designing with the new name and i don't know if you guys can tell but it is so much more balanced so i'm really glad i decided to change it concept number five was this one i thought it was a little interesting it kind of piqued my interest however we didn't love how the word hallelujah was so small and also this element here kind of reminded us of a high school yearbook especially with the year 2020 and yeah those are all of our new concepts so from here we picked our favorite two and then asked for a few more revisions to see it with different fonts and things like that okay so now i'm going to show you guys kind of the process of inputting all the information for the website so for the site mapping they like to use a program called slick plan so they can collect all of the images and text for the website and then input it into it so this is what it looks like this kind of gives you an overview and structure of what the website is there's the home page faq about so once you go and click on one of these i can go in here and input photos answering questions and they will resize everything for me which is really nice so this is what i have done so far and then for places where i don't really have the actual photos because we still need to shoot some brand photography i just kind of put inspiration just so we can have it and see what it would look like once i'm done with each page i just change this to complete so that she knows so yeah it's a really cool system that helps us organize all of the content that needs to be on the website in a really just like easy and basic way i also wanted to show you my pinterest board i started um collecting images for inspiration for our brand photography shoot i guess pinterest is like where i would start with it and then i would create a shot list of images we need and then from there i would probably look for a location and models which i'll just use my friends because that is the cheapest route to go so let me show you kind of what i have for the photography inspiration for the   brand   paired with what will be the primary set of colors and then the secondary set of colors here we have the first concept i had her do them in grayscale as well so that you can compare them side by side and see how they would look if they weren't in color here is the first one so this is an example of a um sweatshirt so you can see the logo as like the the tag on the back of the neck and then also the placement of the logo across the front it looks good on that back tag oh that's so cute and then we have a tang tag example okay it is a few days later and this as you saw this morning we had a meeting with crystal and she presented us some the concepts in like a different visual way because we were having such a hard time deciding which one to go with so i asked to see it on some like physical products so i will insert kind of like a little roll through of everything here and yeah i'm gonna post on instagram to see what you guys like better honestly i think now we're leaning towards the first one we just think it looks really good on everything whereas the second one you kind of lose the details of it she also sent color palettes so i need to play around with those and make sure i like them and then we need to send her our feedback by tomorrow so yeah that's exciting that we're like really starting to nail everything down once we have the logo then i can send that to the manufacturer because he's going to make us hang tags and inside tags to put on to all the sweaters and he needs that design file and once we wrap up that then he can finally make our sample and then in the branding process we will move on to now the website design process which is super exciting we already picked a theme i'm trying to fill in as much content as possible but it's really hard i need to next coordinate like a brand photography shoot because we really need content but like i can't coordinate that until we get the sample and we have to make sure we like the sample because that's what we would be selling to people because i need the actual sweater to take pictures of it's quite the process but i am enjoying every second of it it is about a week later and we have finalized all the branding guidelines and basically when you're done with the whole process they give you a document that looks like this and it outlines your fonts the final logo and it also includes the colors and all that fun stuff so we have our finalized brand guidelines which is super exciting i'm obviously not going to show you all of it because you want to keep some of it private because you want people to copy your fonts and your colors and all those things so we finalized that we picked our final logo and then they also sent us all of the logo files to use which is really exciting now we have progressed in the website design process um i had a meeting earlier today and we talked about or she showed me the first preview of the website i asked for some changes and made comments on it i'll kind of give you an overview of what the website looks like right now the images that you saw that i made and the graphics from earlier in this video definitely did not fit in meshwell on the website so i'm going to have those all taken out and i'll show you kind of some inspiration of kind of what i want the header section to be like i want more of like graphic with layering of photos and just design but yeah that is basically it that is where we are at for the design process we are now finalizing the sample and that should be starting in production very soon and we will just continue on to work on the website i hope you guys enjoyed seeing the behind the scenes of starting a business and you can really see kind of like what goes into it obviously i will share more on hallelujah sunday later on in the process where i really break down our mission in the different aspects because it's much more than just selling a piece of clothing online there is like a lot of community oh he's so big he must have been dreaming anyway so yeah that's it where we are currently at in the process if you guys have any requests on what exactly you want to see or more information on let me know the last thing of branding we're having them do is create social media templates and i also asked if they could help design a newsletter like graphic header template um so that's awesome that they're gonna include that they're not those aren't done yet but yeah fun stuff all right we have reached the end of the video i hope you guys enjoyed seeing a little behind the scenes of what goes into the branding and logo design process when it comes to launching a business if you guys like this please let me know and if you guys want some more like specific vlogs towards different aspects of building a business maybe more like the technical side of like getting an llc and setting up a business bank account or like things like that let me know and i will be sure to do my best to make those i do want this to be kind of like a starting a business series on my channel so i really do hope you guys enjoy this um but yeah that's all i have to say today love you guys and i'll see you in my next video bye hey everybody welcome back to my channel if you haven't been here before my name is cayenne and i make videos on lifestyle and faith and today's video i'm going to be hands-on so today's video is about handsome stop you crazy dog don't be crazy don't be crazy don't be crazy i literally picked the worst time to film this because handsome just woke up from his nap and well need i do i need to explain more go so today's video i'm going to be talking about what it's like to be a youtuber i also asked if you guys had specific questions on being a christian youtuber because obviously that shapes it shapes a lot of my life youtuber gets attacked by dog live video that's what we're gonna do so i asked you guys on instagram if you guys had any questions and as you guys know i am a pretty open book and i'm gonna try to answer questions that maybe some other people try to avoid or kind of brush over so yeah i haven't looked at them yet so let's just get into it okay the first question is how do you separate your private life from your youtube life so i am a very open book and that's just okay for me like i am totally fine with that and it doesn't cause me any issues um it's not like an unhealthy thing for me whereas other people can't share as much because that's like a healthy boundary that they need each person is different but for me i am fine sharing a lot on youtube as far as private life i mean you guys know i share about kyle and i's arguments a lot of time we have to work i always make sure we have worked through that argument before sharing it and we are on the same page about sharing it obviously i'm not going to share things in the middle of an argument when it's like not ha it hasn't been addressed or healed so i think that's one way i separate it another way i separate it is i just i really try not to be on my phone when i'm with friends i don't really vlog a lot when i'm around my friends do you avoid some topics or feel free to share anything you really want man occasionally i will avoid a topic if if something is like making me really bitter and resentful like for example covid stuff when everyone is like scrutinizing people and like just so many people just messaging about like every single thing you do that is something i'm just like you know what i feel a lot of like just bitterness in my heart about it and i don't want to talk up talk about something that i like haven't worked through yet so specific things like that i will avoid how do you handle hate from your subscribers followers as a christian youtuber it's different depending on my mental health i think in the beginning it was like really hard i kind of learned to just pray that god would give me a heart for these people and that they must be really hurting if they want to tear someone else down um and i really just try to pray for those people and love them and not let like any bitterness build up in my heart for example if you guys saw there was a tick tock that went viral that was like making fun of kyle and i's video on boundaries instead of being angry at her i reached out to her and told her more of my testimony because she clearly had been really hurt by purity culture in the church and she took this snippet of my of the boundaries video probably not even realizing what my testimony was and that i do not shame anybody for having sex and like i literally had sugar daddies and was sleeping um with men for money and i do not feel any shame in that because of jesus so instead of being angry at her i sent her um some videos of me like talking to her and just sharing who jesus is a little bit more of my testimony and just letting her know that jesus is more than the people who claim to follow him or who do follow him are all imperfect but he is perfect and yeah so i mean every day is different sometimes i just ignore it sometimes i get defensive sometimes i just try to love them ideally i would just pray for them and love on them because that can be really shocking when someone is very mean to you and you don't respond in a defensive way or a mean way you just simply love them back that can be super shocking for people and show them you know the heart of jesus somebody asked how does the income work okay so you make money in a few different ways so the first would be um google adsense and you're really and google adsense really depends on how many views you get so if i upload like a million videos one month and they all get a decent amount of views you know i might make a thousand dollars or two thousand dollars off google adsense but that always fluctuates depending how many views like if you have one view video go viral that could like make you seven hundred dollars off of just that one video being viewed so that is one aspect of income the next aspect of income is affiliate stuff so for me i am only an affiliate of one thing and that's my christian therapies so basically anyone who signs up i get a commission from it and i get paid that out once a month from anybody who signs up for the christian therapy also that includes like amazon links and you know those kind of links which i don't really share that much i have like my amazon favorites page that's in the description but i don't really like push those out i'm not really like a fashion blogger and i don't want to constantly pushing like stuff towards you guys that you should buy because i mean i will share things genuinely but at the end of the day having a bunch of stuff is not going to make us happy so that is the second way and then the third way is through brand partnerships and sponsorships and that's where you make the most money typically unless you're getting like hundreds of thousands of views or millions of views it's probably brand partnerships that are going to pay the most and that's basically you agree on a rate with this brand and they send you the products to test out make sure you like them you feature them in the video and then they pay you recently i just got a manager who takes care of all of the negotiating and all that stuff for me so they get a 20 cut of that and um also now with them in the picture a lot of and just getting higher paid deals a lot of companies take like 30 to sometimes 90 days to pay so that's kind of been an adjustment that's kind of an adjustment i used to get paid like right before i posted the video like they would see a preview they would send me money but once the once that number goes up holy spirit give me patience and self-control yeah so that's something kind of like we're navigating through because it's fluctuating now because things i did two months ago i still haven't gotten paid for um but once you get in the flow of things it starts like you know being more steady but since that is a new thing yeah i haven't gotten paid for a lot of things they pay based on typically your subscribers and your engagement and how many views you get so those are kind of like the three factors that they take into consideration do you feel pressured to make a certain amount of content christian oh my gosh stop um i think i go through phases where i make christian content like specifically and then i i kind of like was making a lot of it and then i took a break because i really felt god was like taking me um kind of like taking my relationship with him more private handsome you're ruining my pants wow don't be rude why are you being so rude if you want a puppy just remember they go through this stage for a few months don't they i think he has like three more months before his adult teeth will come in are you chill nope he just wants to eat my arm where's your bone where's your phone once i first became a christian i made a lot of christian content um and then as time went on i felt like you know in order to keep my relationship with jesus going strong and i was going through like a really dry season i felt like god just was like calling me to really just keep my relationship with him private and intimate so you probably would have noticed that i stopped making as much christian content for like few a few months um and now i'm just trying to now i'm just trying to find a balance and i think it'll continue to fluctuate depending on the season i'm in with god but i do feel like god is gonna be calling me into making a lot more christian content in the near future like he's preparing my heart for that so um i try not to feel pressured by other people because then it would not be like a genuine i'm sorry if this is so distracting but then it would not be like a genuine representation of my faith with like a pure heart if i was forcing it so yeah i go through definitely different different seasons with it how many subscribers do you have to have to get paid um i would say i probably didn't start getting brand deals until i had about 30 000 subscribers um and they just like weren't very high paying i've noticed like a much bigger increase in um brand partnerships and offers once i started hitting um like over 50k subscribers but to make money off adsense in order to apply to be affiliate on youtube you only have to have a thousand subscribers so technically you can be starting making money with a thousand subscribers and just that is based off how many people view your videos so yeah i would say i did not have youtube as a full-time income until i passed 50 000 subscribers i believe do you feel afraid to be cancelled for your beliefs or something you say i think if i if i don't really have peace about sharing something fully with confidence then i just don't say it but then there are things that will get taken out of context kind of like the tick tock that i shared recently and i'm sure there was thousands of comments of people like hating on um kyle and i's videos and like at the end of the day i probably would have reacted the same before i was saved and like who can blame them you know really like they don't know the truth about jesus and jesus hasn't given them that connection but i do see like i go look on some people's channels who don't have a strong like christian following and people can be so mean i'm just like so grateful that you guys are so um so sweet and nice and supportive like having a christian audience makes a huge difference i cannot imagine having majority of like a secular audience because also what the heck does secular even mean hey google what does secular mean hey stop oh okay so secular okay hey google stop um so secular means that just basically that doesn't i was like what the heck does that mean are you like okay so basically i'm just really happy i have a christian audience because dang people can be so mean but i don't know i don't think i've experienced seen a christian youtuber be cancelled before i don't know anyway the bible says not to fear man so i try my best not to be afraid of people but i am kind of afraid of my dog right now most youtubers move to would you ever i don't think i'll ever move to la i don't i love all the businesses there they're really i like love the aesthetic of everything but the city itself i just find it's like super dirty and crowded and it's honestly like a lot of spiritual warfare that goes on in that city but yeah i could not envision myself living in los angeles maybe like somewhere else in california that's more low-key but okay somebody asked what are your boundaries youtubers make money by selling a lifestyle and most of the time trying to make us buy stuff that we actually don't need oh my gosh i have struggled with this so much ask kyle i literally go back and forth i'm like gosh it'd be cool if i just like never did a brand deal ever again because i definitely think i definitely think social media can just breed really unhealthy desires for always wanting more stuff and i don't want to be a part of that and then on the other hand it's like okay i would if someone asked me where like my couch was or where this cabinet was from like i would tell them because they wanted to know um so typically when i do brand deals like i pick things that i would tell people to buy anyway but it's hard sometimes i wish i just like didn't do brand deals and just had like a patreon account but then in the same way i'm like asking people to subscribe to a monthly payment even if it's just five dollars a month to help support what i do so i don't know i guess it i go back and forth like give me your opinion would you rather pay five dollars a month to support a youtuber or would you rather just watch the brand deals and allow brands to pay the youtubers to make money you know like do i really want my audience to be um responsible for my living like not no but like yeah i don't know but i also like don't want to constantly be shoving so much so many products down your throat that you feel like you just need so much stuff because the world does that already and the way humans are is that our desires are endless even if you had everything like if you could buy literally everything you wanted you would still have more desires it still would not be enough so at the same time trying to balance that and remind people like having stuff is not going to fulfill you and also being someone who struggled with consumerism and like what is it called impulse shopping i definitely go back and forth on this so much so let me know your guys's opinion if you were a youtuber do you think like how would you approach that but as far as boundaries when it comes to that stuff i have a rule that i will never promote something that i wouldn't tell my best friend to buy have i done in the past yes when we were saving for the wedding i feel like and i was like just getting started getting brand offers i wasn't as selective with who i was promoting but moving forward i really try to be selective and always doing it because i genuinely love the product and would share it for free rather than i'm just going to share this because it's you know money in the bank a few people ask me like my equipment so i will have a link to all of the equipment i use in the description below someone said how do you hold on to humility and make sure jesus stays at the center of it all oh my goodness humility is like the most important characteristic to hold on to as a christian just even as a human i think you see so many people in social media who let it go to their head and it's just it's just so toxic and it really it's like you're putting yourself on a pedestal but then also these millions of people are putting on a pedestal so one thing i heard was in a sermon once this guy was saying any compliment i get and any insults i get i give to the lord so no matter what someone says if it's negative or positive i always try to shoot that up to heaven instead of keep it for myself and that way i don't get a big head i don't think of myself as better than others i don't think having like people wouldn't know i had a youtube channel unless they asked me what i do for work like i'm not going around telling everybody kyle typically someone who tells people about it but yeah i just like try not to take like get any pride from how many people follow me how many people like something and it can get a little fuzzy with brand deals because some of them have like guaranteed views that you need to hit and you get paid based on how many subscribers or how many people watch and you basically have a job where you're relying on people being interested in your life which is like it can just be really really toxic so honestly anyone who asked me like how to get into youtube i always say like make sure god's calling you to do it first because it is a really heavy heavy burden to have thousands and thousands of people pick apart your life so yeah it is a huge mental burden if you do not have the heart for it and you also have to make sure your motivations aren't bad because so many people who want to start a youtube channel want to do it for validation for views for followers and for money and i think that is a huge way to stay humble is to just not care about any of those things i don't know if that makes sense but yeah in order to stay humble on youtube it's really by the grace of god when you found jesus and started youtube were people unkind or judgmental um yeah totally it was mostly christians though which is like so sad i will be straight up that christians can be some of the most judgmental and unloving people on this earth and that is so sad to say and i would even challenge that anybody who acts like that is not a follower of christ because christ loves and that is the most important thing to christians to resemble is jesus's love because that is the first and most important commandment but i will say that the most criticism i have gotten is typically from christians and especially when i first got saved and shared my testimony and my testimony started getting hundreds and thousands of views then they would go and look at my other videos and i had like a bikini try on haul and they would tear me apart and listen i'm a i was a baby christian i still am a baby christian and the fact that other christians instead of celebrating you know somebody being saved instead they wanted to tear someone down because they didn't fit the perfect mold of being a christian after a few months like really like do we not have any grace for people it would be so much more effective instead of judging and criticizing christians or just anybody if we really just prayed for them and prayed for that conviction to come on them like that is so much more effective i remember for example meredith foster who is like so on fire for the lord now she posted a video how she wasn't she was like coming back to jesus but she wasn't convicted on waiting till marriage well instead of commenting on that video and saying like and just like judging the crap out of her instead i prayed for her for like a couple of weeks and now look at her like she's thriving she has those convictions and i know that like me commenting mean things was not going to convict her only jesus can convict us only jesus can convict us to even have salvation because salvation is a gift like believing in jesus is a gift what we get from jesus like the ability to believe so anyway all that to say pray for people what is the average monthly income of a youtuber um that really depends how many subscribers they have and how many views they get because some people have like 300 000 subscribers but only are getting like 5 000 views on their videos so even though they have a ton of subscribers companies probably aren't gonna pay them as much because their views aren't consistent it's like such a thing that like nobody talks about um i'm like trying to gauge how much but i feel like if you have over a hundred thousand subscribers they're probably making around at least i would say five thousand dollars per sponsorship um and yeah i think it just fluctuates from there there's a video i watched where a guy literally emailed a bunch of influencers and asked for their rates um so i'll have that linked in the description because that was super interesting and the most like transparent answer i got on what youtube rates are um but there are like some instagramers who charge like ten thousand dollars for an instagram post it is it is pretty crazy how much brands can pay in this marketing that's why you see so many youtubers who can like buy houses and like go out and like buy sports cars like it's crazy i'm sure people like david dobrik are making like millions of dollars every month do you ever feel like you are monetizing god some youtubers get scared of that i think when it comes to like my business that i'm starting i was afraid of that like i didn't want to sell christian apparel and like leave god out of that equation like in the end the christian apparel needs to glorify him but even more than that the money we get from it in some way needs to i feel needs to be pumped back into the kingdom so yes that is something i fear i don't want to monetize god i but at the same time god has given me these opportunities and he's in control of how many views i get and how many people see a video like it was because of him that my testimony took off i know that like he was the one who brought people to the video to watch and he didn't care that i made money off of that like he was just so joyful to provide for me in that way and also to bring so many more of his sons and daughters to him so in a way i'm like so grateful that jesus provides for me in this way but also i need to consider yeah that in the future like i'm not making videos for money i'm making them either to please god or because i genuinely just like enjoy doing it um but yeah circling back to the business that's why when it comes to hallelujah sunday i really wanted a strong mission behind it and a way for us to pour back in to other people and donate some of the proceeds to other people next question is how often do you check your analytics um i went through a phase where i was checking it all the time and it and i was like comparing myself to other youtubers like okay i have this many subscribers i get this many views i have this many followers i get this many likes okay let me go look at this other person who has more followers or more subscribers and see how many views they're getting and i was just comparing myself and that was very toxic because it put me in like a like competition mode or like a righteous like prideful thinking where i wasn't viewing these people as my brothers and sisters in christ i was viewing them as like competition and that was not good so i try not to check very often obviously i notice it sometimes and i do notice if like a video really doesn't perform well because it does affect my partnerships now that a few partnerships do have a view guarantee so that definitely made it harder not to pay attention to analytics because before i like it didn't matter how many views a video got and now it's part of my work which i also don't love but you know it is what it is you can't love every part of your job do you feel like you cannot post a certain type of content because of your religion um yeah probably but typically i'm not posting it because it aligns with my morals so like i would never post like pranking things with my husband that would like be detrimental to my relationship you like you know those videos where it's like um wife cheating prank like i would never ever do that because of my morals and because i would never want to do that to my husband or him to do that to me so there are like certain things like that that i wouldn't post about i do feel like following christ is a lifestyle so i'm not gonna post videos of me like like say it or shot it like getting drunk on camera like i would never ever do that one because i don't get drunk and two because that aligns with my morals so i would like never do it in real life so why would i you know does that make sense so there are things that i wouldn't post but it's not because i'm a christian youtuber it's because i just don't do those things okay somebody asked do you feel pressured to be a perfect example to other christians in certain times yes but i really try to shed that off really quick because at the end of the day i am so imperfect and i mess up all the time and the bible tells us to confess our sins to one another and pray for one another so we can be healed for the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective so if we are not on here sharing our mistakes and just trying to be perfect i just really feel like that is not beneficial to the kingdom and to people who aren't christian because they're like i think that's a huge fault in the church is nobody talks about their mistakes in a way like i do feel like people look to me to be a perfect example and i always try to remind them i am not perfect i do not want to be example i do not want to be an idol i do not want that pressure on me because i am going to fail you miserably the only perfect example is jesus and i think that's why we see so many people get cancelled or whatever is because everyone expects people to be the perfect example in their own eyes it's not even like there's a set of rules that everyone needs to adhere to it's like from your personal opinion you better do everything in the way i think you should do it or that i would do it and then you're good to go and i'm just like that's so wrong we should never expect people in this world to be a perfect example and i would even say a good example because we are sinful people who mess up all the time and i think sharing my failures and faults and flaws is the best thing i could do for you guys um because it it shows you what real life is like i'm not gonna come on here and pretend that i'm perfect and i never do anything wrong and my marriage is great because that is so unrealistic and god did not come to earth for us all to be perfect he gave us the perfect lamb so all of our sins would be forgiven so that's how i feel about that and anyone who's trying to be that perfect example lord i just pray that you would lift that burden off of them because your yoke is easy or is it your yoke is light your burden is lazy you're burdened i feel like i'm saying a rap song now i've been talking for so long anyway anyone who feels a pressure to be a perfect christian or perfect example god i just pray that you would lift this burden off of them that you are our perfect example and the perfect person for us to look up to and none of us have to bear that weight thank the lord that we don't have to carry that weight on us should we strive to be amazing disciples and follow your commandments and be more like you yes but do you expect us to be perfect no so thank you jesus you're the best all right everybody i'm going to end the video with that i hope you guys enjoyed a little look into what it's like to be a youtuber and specifically a christian youtuber if you have any more questions feel free to leave them in the comments below and i i appreciate all the questions you guys asked on instagram um i've been like so dry on youtube lately i've definitely taken like a break from being on social media and posting and just like really allowing myself to rest and let my soul catch up to me i've been reading a book called the relentless elimination no the ruthless relentless the rep the relentless elimination of hurry and it's all about how america and probably all over the world everyone's in such a rush all the time and how that is detrimental to our mental health and also our spiritual health so i would highly recommend it i'll have it linked in the description see here i go sharing products that you don't need just a reminder you don't need to read this book although i might argue you should read like really really should read this book but yeah it's just like a natural thing like we share things we like anyway major sidetrack i've been reading that book and it's been so amazing and it's made such a difference on my life already just trying to walk out these principles and just take time to slow down and not to constantly be on my phone or posting or have my like video videoing things and stuff like that so i appreciate your patience all that to say there's a little life update for you and i definitely will be posting a little bit more frequently but no promises i'm just taking it at jesus's pace and trying to really soak in this life that we get instead of always being in a rush so love you guys jesus loves you more i'll see you in my next video hello everybody welcome to this vlog i've decided i'm just gonna do like a weekly vlog vlog i've never done like a week in my life i usually do like a daily vlog or two days but yeah i thought it

some depop orders i don't know if i've mentioned in a video yet but if you follow me on instagram you know i've been reading about called the ruthless elimination of hurry it's so good highly recommend oh i think i mentioned in my last video actually highly recommend it i'll have it linked in the description but i'm just not in a hurry you know just enjoying life and just living it up and i feel so good god is good anyway so i'm gonna head home oh why i said that in the first place was i'm selling like i'm trying to get rid of like eighty percent of my closet maybe uh maybe like seventy percent of my closet so i'm selling it all on depop just decluttering and simplifying my life and my wardrobe i think i'm gonna do a whole video on it potentially but yeah that's why i'm selling so much stuff so i need to go home and grab all of the d-pop orders and then we're gonna go take a trip to the post office and i actually enjoy going to the post office because my friend owns a shipping store so i get to bring handsome and i get to chat with her and just like you know not in a hurry if i want to hang out at the post office for an hour i'mma do it and just enjoy a conversation with my friend so that's what is on the agenda today so let's head home enjoy the fresh air we made it home he picked up the handsome boy yeah thank you thank you for the kisses thank you for the kisses um okay so we're gonna take handsome on errands we need to go ship out all the orders and then we also need to stop and get him dog food hit somebody down handsome lay down please so he's typically really good in the car once we start driving we've been taking him in the car since he was a puppy so he can really get used to it because we plan on doing like road trips with him in the future and we want to make sure he doesn't have any anxiety with the car right now he just wants to bite everything so i need to start moving so he can lay down um so yeah okay it's okay i love you too i don't know i know i missed you too we miss you so much hey hello okay it is now 3 50. i got back from all of our errands picked up some dog food now i'm feeding handsome and i wanted to show you guys some of the tricks he can do because he's such a good boy spin yes sit oh you're gonna spin again okay okay okay oh you're gonna spin again sit no sit oh he's just doing spins over and over again i know you think okay sit yes paw good boy okay up yes good boy   good boy i love that one it's so cute so you know how there's always one place in your apartment where you just throw stuff and it's like a really bad habit this is mine the kitchen island for like everyday stuff i always throw things there when i get home but then this spot this is the second place like it just things just start piling up here so i really need to organize all of this and organize these cabinets better so we can kind of keep this section more organized or i just need to get rid of this stuff but it has been a goal of mine to at least keep the island clean so most of this stuff is from this morning so i'm just going to do a quick tidy up so the house looks nice and fresh   okay just finished like a 15 minute tidy up if you guys need some encouragement to go do it just go do it it feels so good everything is nice and clean aside from that it's for like my dyson um warranty and i need to like go register it so i want to keep it out to remind me i did want to show you something because i came across this book that i was reading this morning a little update on my hair my bangs are growing out pretty quickly they're just not for me i just i just don't like styling them i feel like when my hair is long and just has face framing it looks the best on me so i'm just gonna start growing my hair out again i'm definitely one of those people who like i'm willing to try things but you just can't go wrong with long hair so i'm gonna let it grow out again i've just literally been tucking my bangs back because i don't feel like styling them and i just can't achieve the look that i was going for i think they're too long this is like a couple day old hair so it's pretty grimy anyway okay but i wanted to show you guys this book i think i mentioned this in kyle and i did a q a about our wedding night on our couple's channel if you haven't seen it i'll have it linked here and in the description but we did a video on our wedding night and i referenced this book so one of our friends recommended this book actually they gave it to us as a wedding gift and they said we could read the other chapters later but we should read the chapter on the honeymoon about the honeymoon so that's what we did we read this actually on our honeymoon and it was like super helpful and i would highly recommend it for any of you guys who are married and want to just learn more about god-centered sex how to improve your sex life i don't any time i'm filming he just has been broken i don't know if he's going through like a phase what what do you want what do you want why are you barking at me why are you barking at me i love you you can't have all this attention all the time though why are you barking okay chew on that leave me alone leave me alone really all right getting back to what i was saying this book is very helpful especially if you're waiting till marriage girl it got you it breaks down the private parts it tells you what to expect like what you should be focusing on love making cycles honestly this is very helpful even though i have had sex in my past this has given me a whole new perspective on sex and it literally breaks down some sex positions like this is really great espec like if you were a virgin this is like so good but if you're not a virgin it's still so good but it's all about an intimate marriage and having a fulfilling sex life and it's all about like centered around christ too so i'll link this in the description like it's just learning about sex in a christian way instead of from like porn or the world you know or like unrealistic shows just really breaks it down and it has exercises throughout on like things you can actually put into practice with your husband um to communicate about sex more because that's so important okay well that's my little chat about sex i would probably read it like right before you're gonna get married because it goes into depth and it is like the language is very descriptive and there's also diagrams so yeah i would read it like very close to your wedding so it doesn't get in your feels hey dude i'm gonna mute your butt i'm muting you you're so loud nobody wants to hear you bark do you guys have a puppy was your dog like this when i was a puppy like i feel like he just needs attention from people all the time anyway i'm gonna sit down edit a video i'll probably finish off today's little vlog portion here and you know i'll see you tomorrow kyle just got home and look what he got me some pretty flowers every day is valentine's day they smell so good they're so cute i love them thank you of course you want to say hi to the vlog what's going on i'm doing a weekly vlog weekly vlog on your week yeah okay i don't know i always do daily vlogs so i figured i would just do like a week in my life or like a few days in my life but the thing is what's the thing i talk so much like when i get in the zone i film so much so i love that about you it might be long it's okay you guys don't mind that it's long right       okay guys welcome to friday good morning welcome welcome i don't even need to say welcome you guys were already welcome to the beginning it's friday morning i'm trying to have quiet time oh my gosh ah what happened to your bear this is my life one minute he's a sweet little angel and then next he's a biting maniac okay stop flashing from your wee-wee as you saw we woke up on the couch he woke up really early today he woke up at like 6 40 so i got brought him out to the bathroom and thank the lord he went back to sleep really fast and we snuckled on the couch this morning it was so sweet but then but then this is what happens anyway okay nope not the hair i would typically make a coffee but my friend stacy's coming over in a little bit and we're gonna have coffee together here so i'm gonna wait and just drink a lot of water i read my devotional it's really gross i spilled coffee on it last week this is the new morning mercies it's one of my favorite devotionals it is my favorite devotional i think if you're a newer christian i would probably recommend what's it called embraced i'll have that one linked in the description too um i typically read whatever verse they reference in here i like this one because they give you a whole section not just one verse it could be like 10 verses so i like to read that so i just read romans 5 and then i'm currently reading mark if you feel like you haven't been hearing from god i highly recommend reading the gospels because you hear from god every morning well obviously the whole word is god-breathed but i just find such a difference when i'm reading jesus's words so i'm reading through the gospels i think it'd be cool to just read through the gospels like over and over again oh i get a ton of questions on my highlighters i've shared on instagram i have a link in my highlights this is what they look like they are the tombow abt pens i love them you have to get light colors some of them do bleed but like this purple color doesn't bleed but then there's colors like this like this dark red that bleeds a little bit i also have thick pages kind of for bible so anyway i love these i just go to a local craft store and pick them up individually that way i can select the exact colors i want but they also sell them in packs so i'll link some of the packs from amazon below if you go to the craft store make sure to use one of their coupons okay it has been quite a while since i checked in it is now 3 p.m my friend stacy came over and we just had some like really good girl talk and yeah just christian fellowship it's the best just having friends who you can pour into and they can pour into you has been such a blessing she's been married for nine years and i just am very excited to learn from her but it's so cool even though i haven't been married very long like god can still use me to pour into her life too so yeah we met through church and tonight we're gonna go to a bible study at her house um so maybe you'll see a little bit of that later but right now i really have to get everything ready to take handsome to the vet so i've collected his poop sample now i need to collect the dog bring some treats and hit the road it literally looks like i have a diaper on my face right now this thing is insane let me just cover my whole face not that right what does that mean good morning it is   anyway it's the next day it's saturday now last night we went to bible study and it was so much fun yeah it was so good we typically spend like the first hour just hanging out fellowshipping and then we went through first timothy one had some good discussion and then we prayed over all the men so last week we prayed over all the women so this week we prayed over all the men and just gave them words prophesied and it was really nice except for it took forever we were there until midnight we're a half hour away so by the time we got home it was 12 30. yeah so now it is 8 30 on saturday i would have slept in but we have another church thing to go to we are taking a class at our church called elements it's basically just like the elements of faith yeah like the basics the fundamentals you know it's something they do they require if you want to surf at the church that you just take that class just so you have the understanding and um yeah the foundation to build up so guys the judgment seat of christ should fill up with such hope and excitement but also a healthy fear of the lord so we finished our class it's now like much later it's 3 p.m and the class was amazing he was just teaching on i don't know if i brushed on this earlier just the elements of faith and this class was a lot about um basically the end times so i learned a lot about the end times and all the different theories people have on like the last years and like when jesus is coming and honestly i never really have looked into the end times much so it was super interesting and really cool to kind of just hear all the different perspectives on it and then we talked about prayer the word of god and generosity and honestly the most fruit i got was actually from our break off conversation so kyle went and sat with a few guys and i went with um these two older women probably i think she said she was 60 50. she looked so young for that um but she was just like pouring out like marriage advice and generosity advice and just like so much good wisdom i definitely love doing these classes because i feel like in church in in a lot of churches it's hard to get connected with older people and like other generations but i found just like in our church there's just so many people of all ages who are so on fire for god and it's like so diverse there that it's just amazing so we've been meeting like so many older people who love the love the lord like so much and yeah it was really nice um so kyle actually went to go work and i am home with handsome and currently watching through the video to mark down just links i need to put in or cards i need to add i should really do this while i'm editing to save time because i don't love watching my videos back like i literally haven't watched it back since i like never hardly ever watch my whole videos through after i edit them i kind of skim through that's probably because i just still like hearing myself talk after i've edited myself talk for like hours handsome got went to the vet yesterday so he's been like so sleepy all day this is like the first i've seen him up and he's playing with a bag so anyway we don't really have much else planned for tonight i might just make like a hello fresh meal later so maybe i'll film that handsome handsome come here i need to take that away from you come here it's just like the weirdest things that keep dogs entertained but i feel like that's probably a choking hazard so i should probably grab it well today is sunday we slept in because we were both so exhausted and we went to church and church was really good we said goodbye to kyle's parents because they're heading back to philadelphia and now i'm just hanging out on the couch i just discovered allison birkenstaff i think her name is i feel like i've heard people say her name a lot and i finally looked her up and wow i love i've only watched two videos so far but she's very calm calming has a very calming presence there's a another service tonight at six and it is our church is hosting a prophetic night our pastor um encourages our church a lot in the spiritual gifts and especially in prophecy he is a very prophetic man so yeah if you guys want to learn more about prophecy i highly recommend reading first corinthians 14. they talk all about prophecy there i can leave a link in the description if you're interested in watching it back to see what our experience was also put a link to the church service from this morning so you can kind of see that's kind of fun you can kind of see the church service that we went to kyle's leaving for out of town he's going on a snowboarding trip tomorrow morning and he'll be gone monday and tuesday i've noticed the past two days i haven't had my quiet time in the morning and i've been on my phone a bit more and it's definitely impacting my mental health it's crazy how just that increase and then like not having that morning time drastically impacts how you feel at least it does for me so yeah i'm excited for a new week fresh start and get back into my sweet mornings if you can tell i'm not in the best mood but that's okay we have good days and bad days but no matter what the day is god is still good so we can always rejoice in that   speaks edification and speaks comfort to people and and so that gift in that chapter it says all may prophesy one by one to get the prophecy elevated by the other gifts not not made by importance but by availability everybody gets in in this party come on good morning it always looks like i have a mullet in the mornings with my bangs okay okay and crazy mode turned on it's now monday let there be light kyle left this morning at like 5 30 a.m to go on a snowboarding trip but when he got out so did handsome so for a solid like hour hansen was just being crazy and just now he can jump on the bed so he was jumping up there with his toys and like literally like sitting on my head playing with his toys so i didn't get the best sleep the last hour so i'm still a little tired but i booked a boxing class on class pass it's one of those things like dang it i regret booking it but also like i should go literally i think the last workout i did was well i went skiing and then before that i did like a ballet at home workout which was really fun but yeah i haven't worked out in a long time are you sunbathing so i need to get ready really quick and leave this workout so   oh my goodness oh my goodness hi hi hi hi okay let's not eat my hair okay okay yeah oh thank you thank you i'm back from the workout it was so hard we did this one exercise where we had to go on the bikes and then burn five calories and then go to the bags and do um 30 punches and oh my gosh i literally felt like i was going to throw up almost did but i just like took a couple minutes to catch my breath and completed the workout and yeah by the way i'll have my class fast link i think it's always linked in the description if you guys want to try it out i love using class pass that way i don't have to commit to one kind of gym i can just hop around so workout was really good then we're out of coffee so i was like i should go get a coffee and then i was like i should go stop the grocery store and i got a salted caramel cold cold foam cold brew salted caramel a salted caramel foam cold brew i don't know but i ended up buying some things to try to make this at home so maybe i'll try to do another one today or i'll try to make some more foam to add to the top of this one because i really like these but i don't like going to starbucks spending all the money so let me show you what i got i just got a bag of spinach i love to add spinach to smoothies um bag of kale arugula i want to do some avocado toast and arugula spices it up broccoli i got this loaf a bit bread i was going to get like a fancy sourdough but the sourdough lows were like five dollars and this was only a 1.99 so a couple avocados for the avocado toast i think i'm gonna do this ricotta cheese on the toast as well and this is what i got for the cold foam so basically i looked up on youtube and it's part heavy whipping cream part half and half and then caramel syrup and that's about it and then you add the salt um i got this extra creamy oatmeal kyle and i like this one and i figured i should just buy some cold brew coffee because i don't feel like doing the 10 hour process to make that part of this maybe later okay and i got these strawberries these cost an arm and a leg they were 4.99 but i couldn't resist they look so juicy um and then i got some bananas i'm really bad at using my bananas typically they go bad but i want to get better i usually use them for smoothies but i need to freeze them before they go brown so there is a little mini grocery haul so yeah i'm going to make some avocado toast maybe try to make that cold pho i can't say it i'm sorry i'm just going to eyeball it i don't want to know how much to add some pink himalayan this is a frother so come give it a frog all right let's get a top off do a little taste test that's good i think a little more like caramelly than the starbucks one but it's still really good   okay let's do a taste test this looks so good really good i think i'm gonna add some salt and pepper one more hot sauce the cheese tastes really similar to the avocado so might have used a different cheese but overall it is very good now i am gonna sit down yeah i'm just gonna do an email a couple emails maybe make a to-do list and like clean up the house i feel like i can't be very focused and productive when my surroundings are really messy so yeah that's the plan okay if you watched my branding and like logo design starting a business vlog you would have seen a preview of the website well i just got another revision and it looks so much better than it did in the other video so i wanted to give you guys a sneak peek and also wanted to get you guys to vote on which option you like better i'll probably have already made a decision by the time this video goes up but i'm very curious and i can always change it because it's like a really simple color change but yeah i want to get your opinion so let me know what you think so this is the top bar option one i'm not gonna like show you more because it's really this is the only part they changed so this is option one and this is option two so let me know what you guys think one or two in the comments     just did a quick cleanup and i came into the room and look what i see that i have no idea what this is i don't know if it's like throw up or i don't know it's like it doesn't smell like pee anyway i'm gonna put some cleaner to sit on it and then i'm getting a new set of sheets tomorrow because look at how many holes are in these these are like linen sheets and these things were not cheap and i think it's like that's so bad i think it's because i did use bleach and you're not supposed to but they're just our sheets are so gross right now so i actually reached out to zola because those were a wedding gift um and they are kindly sending us a replacement which was so nice and they come in tomorrow so i'm like i don't even feel like washing our sheets until i can do it all in one go but now that there's like throw up or something on them i think i'll just watch like the comforter cover and then honestly i'll just sleep on these sheets tonight and then i'll have a fresh set of sheets tomorrow i'm so excited that being said i am basically out of cleaner so i'm going to refill this bottle i use the thieves cleaner from young living looks like this i ordered these bottles on amazon so if you want i have one of these for cleaning and then i have another one with water for plants so i'm gonna spray both of these things on there and let it sit for a while handsome really she's getting too big hey get down so i just packaged up some depop orders and stopped at the post office i just found out there is a post office literally two minutes down the street from me and i've been going to one that's like an eight minute drive and it's always so packed and this is like empty so wow what a blessing that is and then i stopped um at this ice skating arena rink ice skating rink um that's right down the street again two minutes away from my house and that is something like i've always wanted to try is ice skating and actually like learn and take lessons i feel like as an adult we kind of forget to have hobbies and learn new things but i truly believe we are never too old to start something new and ice skating is something i've been wanting to do so i stopped in just to get a rundown of what they have for adults so they have two options and i am yeah debating doing some classes there literally just for fun if it fits in our budget so yeah i stopped in here to get some information now i'm gonna head back home and probably just do like stuff around the house like cleaning up that lovely mess that handsome left and yeah i'm debating if i wanna take this vlog till tomorrow because tomorrow's a little bit more interesting although like one of my friends is coming over she's like a professional organizer and she's gonna help me organize one of our closets and maybe the pantry but i think i'm gonna do a whole video on that so yeah i don't know we'll see how it goes i think i'm gonna start importing all this footage and see how much content i have and if it's good to go i'll just like wrap it up tonight all right but i'm gonna head back i'm starting to sweat hey guys so it is a few days later from the last clip i ended up starting to edit it and it was like 45 minutes long so i just decided to stop vlogging then but i wanted to say goodbye i think later that night i did a girls night with basically all of the girls whose husbands were out of town and yeah we went and hot tubbed and hung out at our friend stacy's house so that was really fun and yeah it is now wednesday kyle is back also please let me know if you like these weekly vlogs and if there's anything in particular that you would want me to film during my weekly vlog um or vlogs in general like different things you want to see more of let me know because that will be very helpful for me anyway i love you guys and i hope you have an amazing week
