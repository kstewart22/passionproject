you already   feel close to Jesus yeah awesome I love   you a cool bracelet sir prom I just put   that together I'm married I'm sorry but   I like the boldness keep it up oh that   was awesome   all right y'all I'm gonna pray for us   today and we're gonna get into the word   and I can't wait to just share a little   bit of my story today with you guys so   let's pray holy God we just thank you so   much for this day god I thank you for   this conference and I thank you for just   so many people that have come just to   love on these students and pour out the   wisdom that you've given them and God I   pray that this is just retained by the   students I gotta get straight into their   heart and just revives their spirit Lord   God I pray that these students would   leave confident fill with the spirit of   who you are with love a joy with peace   God that they would go onto their   campuses and just touch so many people   for your glory god I pray that you speak   through me and help articulate this   message God and I pray at the end of   this there would be a response just say   yes say you God Lord we love you I thank   you for meeting us in this space when we   feel your presence all around it's in   your name we pray amen amen   all right all right guys I'll be talking   today about responding to the call of   God on your life okay so pretty casual   conversation we've probably all had a   message on responding to the call of God   on your life and you probably heard a   message preached I'm responding to the   call but as I was studying and praying   for this event I was like Lord you know   what do you want me to say cuz last year   there was such a specific word that I   felt I got for this event and I just   felt like to come encourage you to   really respond to what God is calling   you to do and you might be sitting here   in your light we're in high   Skol chill have my whole life to respond   to the call of God but how amazing would   it be if y'all actually took everything   that's happening here that you're   feeling that you're experiencing and you   activated that with an obedient response   and started moving on that like it would   change a generation actually it would   change everything about the world we   live in because the impact that y'all   have is very significant in the room and   so I really want to seriously talk to   you all about this and I really just   want to share my story and kind of how I   experienced responding to the call of   God so we're gonna talk about two   different types of calls how many of you   and light literally raise your hand   we're just gonna be so casual and taught   today how many of you feel like you're   called by God you have a call in your   life okay that is so encouraging   now not everybody raised their hand but   most everybody raised their hand if you   raise your hand if there was a right   answer that was the right answer   everybody should have and could have   raised their hand because everybody is   called by God   now the first call I'm kind of talking   about is that everybody call we're all   called to say yes to Jesus we're all   called to lay our life down take up our   cross follow Jesus and live in obedience   to the Word of God that's kind of that   call that we all feel we all know we're   like yes we might have already said yes   to that call it's kind of like I put it   like this if God like sent out a group   text to the world we all got it and it   was this that was the initial like first   call okay everybody has access to it now   there's like another type of specific   call and sometimes that's like the call   that you feel by the spirit you're like   I kind of feel like it wasn't like a   group text it was like hey Sadie I   really want you to go do this and that's   a specific hall that you kind of feel a   stirring if anybody's seen frozen - it   kind of feels like that you're like I   hear this voice and I don't know where   it's coming from but I feel like I   should go cuz it's good like that's that   call like and honestly that whole movie   kind of represents it because it's not   just like a one call it's like you keep   hearing him and you keep hearing him and   you keep hearing and you just kind of   follow until you really find yourself in   the place that he was leading you to go   so that's a good movie you should watch   it but for   that's kind of that second type of call   so for me whenever I responded to the   first call I was 13 years old and I know   it's kind of young but I really just   felt like I wanted to be baptized and it   kind of came from when I was 13 I went   overseas to play basketball anybody play   basketball right no I don't know I know   I don't look like much but I can ball it   up on the court okay and I was playing   basketball at 13 over season it was the   first time I was like away from my   parents like literally could have done   anything over there they were like   throwing these crazy parties because it   was like all the high schoolers and we   were in a different country and so we   could and whenever I was there like it   just didn't feel right my spirit I was   like I don't really want to participate   in that because everything I had learned   everything I knew about the Bible I   actually wanted to follow Jesus and so I   came back home and I opened up to my   parents and so my dad like hey it was   crazy over there but it really made me   realize that I really do believe the   Bible and I really do want to be   baptized so I would love it if you   baptize me so my dad set me down and he   studied the word with me and I got   baptized I'm not gonna lie after I got   baptized not much happened like my life   didn't like dramatically change I just   kept following Jesus messed up here and   there it wasn't like oh I got baptized   and now like I'm on fire for the Lord I   wish I could say that it was but that   just didn't happen and I don't know if   it was because I didn't just fully   understand it at a time where I was 13   you know but then fast forward and at   this point I was 17 and I was at a   conference like so similar to this like   the room is almost identical and like I   remember exactly her sitting I was on   this like section like towards the back   on the right side it was just I'll never   forget this day   and I'm sitting there and honestly like   don't expect much I don't really expect   much to get out of the conference I've   been to so many conferences in my life I   like I knew I loved Jesus had already   been baptized I was honestly just there   right and I'm sitting there and this   woman came up and from the way I grew up   I grew up a very traditional background   and women didn't preach in the church   this is the first time I ever saw a   woman preach now 17 and she comes up and   I mean she is just preaching the word   she is on fire and the whole time I mean   my mouth could have hit the floor I was   just like it was the coolest thing   you've ever seen   and it was everything she was saying but   it was also how she was saying it that   just got me and I started to realize at   17 you know my family show had already   started I'd already kind of stepped into   this celebrity lifestyle if you will and   I'm sitting here and I started to think   about man everything she says matters   like everything that person is saying   and she it actually matters because it's   from the Word of God and it's actually   impacting me and influencing me and I   was like if I'm gonna be influencing   people I want to influence people like   that I want to be saying something that   matters I want to be saying something   that actually moves somebody and so at   the end she does this altar call and I   just went to the front and fell on my   face I was weeping and I really feel   like that's it's time I really responded   to the call of God I was like now my   whole life is yours   like any way you want to use me use me   I just want to serve you God and you   know I listen to a lot of Billy Graham   and Billy Graham says whenever he talked   about the color god he said you know   we're actually all called to ministry   and he says ministry is not maybe not   what you're thinking because maybe you   haven't felt called by God because   you're like well I don't really know if   I want to work in a church but Billy   Graham says no ministry literally means   just to serve it means to serve the Lord   and so no matter what you're doing no   matter where you are no matter what   position you find yourself in if you   serve the Lord in that position like   Colossians 3:23 says do it for as if   you're working for the Lord not for man   then you're doing ministry you're   responding now to the call of God on   your life and so when I was 17 and I   went forward and I fell on my face I   felt like okay now I'm really responding   to the call of God shortly after that   this mints were mine she came up to me   and I was still living in Louisiana at   the time she said say I just feel like   I'm supposed to give you this word I   just feel so strongly she said the word   is affinity anybody heard that word and   any   it's kind of a different word but it   means in the Hebrew language it   literally means here I am God no limits   no distractions send me and she said I   feel like you really need to step into   that like you are really following him   you you are saying yes but there's like   another level of like I don't there's no   limits to what you can do like I'm gonna   put you outside of your box and I'm   actually gonna step forward to what   you're calling me to do and I was like   okay yeah like I receive that that's   awesome I found out that that's actually   in the Bible so many times   Abraham responded with Hannity Here I am   Samuel responded like that Moses   responded like that Here I am it's that   same word you see it so many times and   so I felt encouraged by it but honestly   once again just like being baptized I   didn't really do anything else my life   didn't look different the next day but   then in that in the meantime of that   happening I felt like I was supposed to   move to Nashville and this was like my   first like let it go moment it's like I   just feel like I'm supposed to do that   something in my heart's telling me I I   could go there and I could really be   used by God there and I could be I know   I could be used anywhere just like we   all can but I felt like I was supposed   to be there and so I told my parents we   had this long conversation about it and   I ended up moving to Nashville and when   I got there to be honest that was kind   of me saying Here I am but I still was   limiting God I still had so many   distractions going on I wasn't fully in   it but I took the first step and y'all   won't believe what happened this is so   crazy so I decided to go to a church   first Church I heard of somebody's like   you should go to the belonging I was   like okay Yeah right   so noise is going but I didn't I get to   the volume and this woman walks up on   stage her name's Alex Ely the same woman   who was the first preacher I ever saw   preach years ago and I'm like that is so   crazy it's Alex healing she's the one I   responded to so she gets up there and   I'll never forget she leans over and I'm   just like so excited to see that it's   her she didn't know me shouldn't even   know I was there I sat in the way--by   didn't anybody see me and she leans over   her podium just like this just on a   regular Church day and she said I feel   so different tonight and her Australian   accent   I'm not gonna preach the word that I   came to preach tonight she said I feel   like I'm supposed to change the word   because somebody in here needs to hear   something very specific and I'm so   interested on my Oh who's this gonna be   before I like looking around like trying   to see who's gonna respond who's gonna   be like oh my gosh and she's sitting   there and she's like um ya know and she   goes and before I start this she said if   God repeats himself you need to be   listening and I'm just like sitting here   like you know I'm already taking notes I   literally wrote down if God repeats   himself you'd better listen she said the   word is Hannity and I'm like oh it's me   and she's like I'm not even kidding I   was like oh shoot the Lord is literally   looking at me right now and she was like   the word isn't in here and it means Here   I am God and she said no limits no   distractions   send me she said if you recently prayed   that but she still have limits and you   still have distractions you need to let   go of your safety net and you need to   really let him send you oh goodness I   like was I mean it was the craziest   thing ever like Alex and I had never met   see I'm saying like that's her   responding to the Lord's voice and me   better be listening to the voice of the   Lord and I'm sitting there and I knew I   had limits I knew I had distractions I   knew I was putting the God of the   universe and a box but I didn't know how   big he was cuz I never trusted him   enough to step out and see because I was   just keeping all my little safety nuts   sure I moved to Nashville but I made   sure everything was in order and   everything was gonna be all right and my   life didn't really have to change that   much but after this moment I'm not   kidding the next day everything started   to shift I let go of my safety net and I   knew exactly what those things were cuz   the guy was dating it was the agency   that I thought I needed but no I really   just needed God it was different things   that I was saying well this is what the   world would say is the right thing to do   but that's definitely not what I had   peace to do and as I begin to do that   God began to blow me away so want to   talk to y'all and I want to challenge   you with that thought and how are you   responding to God it   be Here I am it might be I've already   walked forward it might be yes god I   love you I'm responding to you but is it   no limits no distractions I want you to   send me are you willing to walk for it   and trust them are you willing to let   down your safety net are we willing to   really respond to God   so I started to think about what is that   Here I am dot dot dot what's the next   phrase for most of us and I came up with   something kind of fun anybody do the   India Graham okay good   not kind of people if you don't know   what the India Graham is there's nine   different types personality test I love   the in agreement we're not really   talking about the India Graham but I   decided to make nine types of responders   to God and this is how we're gonna have   this teaching lesson and as we do this   it's gonna be fun there's some funny   stories or some funny gifts involved but   I really want you to think if that's you   if this is how you're responding to God   let's think about why and let's think   about laying that down and actually   saying getting to the point of st. here   I am no limits no distractions send me   so the first one we have it up the first   one is the runaways now this is the time   that hears the call of God so you really   heard him but then you run away from the   call of God this is really like Jonah so   Jonah we all know he was called by God   go to Nineveh he gets his big calling   and he's like yep   gotta go runs away well what happens to   journey we all know he got swallowed by   a whale well the Bible says a fish and   he was in there for three days until he   was like okay Lord you are the god of   the universe has this total repentance   turning moment and then God ends up   using him so the outcome of that is he   went back to the call so maybe some of   you were like that you've heard you felt   called you really feel like you know   what you're supposed to do and you just   kind of been running away from it   because it's really overwhelming you're   like yeah no I think I heard you totally   wrong got a run but you can't outrun the   call God we all know we sing it reckless   life he's coming after you he's chasing   after you his reckless love nothing can   separate you from that reckless love you   can't ignore it   you can try to ignore it you can try to   run from it but it's still there   you still know it and let me tell you if   you're waiting for peace your pieces on   the other side of that obedience you can   be in a way scarier situation but if you   have peace that surpasses all   understanding it don't really matter   where you're placed all right the next   one let's see what it is this is the   proven now this one is very relatable   I've actually totally done this before   and the funny thing about the nine types   is you've probably done a few of them to   prove it they typically asked for a sign   anybody asks for a sign yep we all have   we all been there it says they believe   God will use them when he does certain   things to prove that he will so this is   like Thomas anybody remember Thomas you   know Jesus is already resurrected but he   and he had shown himself to other people   but not yet Thomas and Thomas is sitting   there he's like yeah well if God really   resurrected I'd have to see the   nail-scarred hands then I would believe   it and then Jesus comes through a locked   door and it's like hey Thomas I want to   see something yeah you know like you   didn't do it like that Jesus a much more   humble and graceful but the point is he   proved it   Gideon he's like if you do this then   I'll believe God did it and so then he   went on and did it you know I don't   necessarily think we need to ask for a   sign Jesus kind of talked about not   asking for a sign he said a wicked   generation ask for sign I am your sign   he talks about that but I will tell you   one time I did ask for a sign and God   really does always prove it I am ashamed   to say I was dating this guy and I knew   it wasn't supposed to be with him but I   really didn't want to break out with him   and I was like oh it's gonna be so   terrible is like God just give me a sign   if I'm supposed to break out with him no   joke that weekend went on a date he ran   into a stop sign like ran into it yeah I   was like got you you proved it it's true   okay we need to end this right now so   I'm not saying that he won't respond to   his time but I'm just saying we   needed God God really is decide his   voice is enough   but if you actually need it you might   legit run into a stop sign okay next the   half listeners we might have some in the   voting right now maybe that's like me I   went to Nashville I halfway listen but   then I was like okay now that I'm here   I'm just gonna chill in my comfort zone   this is the type that here's God's plan   and kind of does it but really that's   what they want to do in other words it   just disobey   it's like Adam and Eve they hear the   plan they're like cool great   don't eat the Apple what do they do eat   the dang Apple you know I mean we   halfway listen but we didn't really   follow through with disobeyed Kings saw   a prime example of this he halfway   listen he the Lord said hey you're gonna   go into this bad I want you to destroy   everything about these people well he   destroyed almost all of it except for   the auxins because those look really   nice and some other nice animals and   then God was like it's not what I asked   and so what happened well they didn't   fully obey they didn't get the fullness   of God see that's the thing   God really is such a good God he's so   kind I mean if you don't respond to the   call that he has in your life I'm not   saying he's gonna strike you down but   there is a fullness that we can   experience on earth when we follow that   call of God like I'm saying I'm not   saying in a fullness cuz I think some   people misunderstand they're like well   life's not going so great I don't have   this I don't have this platform I don't   have this stage I don't have this amount   of money I'm not talking about anything   like that I'm talking about the fruit of   who he is like that's enough that's   better than anything the world has to   offer you and that's what you receive   when you're walking in the center of the   will that he has for for your life so   you want to fully listen   not because it's a burden to flew listen   because it's the best thing that you   could possibly do to fully listen   because you get the fullness of God all   right what's next the who Me's this is   probably my favorite one because this   gif is hilarious and I feel like I've   done that face to God a lot of times it   says they don't feel like they are the   one for the call God's given them   insecurities normally   this is Moses like God comes him he   actually did the whole Here I am think   this is the Here I am   and then God's like alright great here   you are you're listening I want you to   go back to Pharaoh and the immediate   Moses is like ooh not me Who am I that I   could do that and here Moses is asking   God trying to figure out who he is that   he could possibly do this and God simply   says wait a second it's not about who   you are I am Who I am and when Moses   gets this revelation it's so didn't ends   and Moses literally has this full-on   conversation with God gods like drop   your staff it turned into a snake pick   it back up you're showing a miracles   crazy things are happening but it really   all boiled down to one thing   Moses was there he knew God was real he   knew God knew his name he knew God could   do miracles but he could not get over   the fact that he had a speech problem   it's like some of us in here we're like   oh yeah we believe in God wholeheartedly   yes we know he can do all these amazing   things when we worship we feel this   presence when we feel called by him all   I seen but you know I'm only 17 oh I   have a speech problem I'm really not the   best at that well I really don't really   know what I would do if I was in that   and we start to list all the reasons why   we're not capable of what God has   equipped us to do and so I'm gonna say I   feel like I've done that so many times   Dahl was calling me to speak and I was   like God like I'm terrible on a   microphone like if somebody called me   out in class to read like the whole   popcorn situation that was like the   worst day of the year for me I like   hated that I would get so nervous   because I was not I didn't like that   kind of stuff so this is very ironic but   I'm telling you when God calls you to   something everybody says he equips you   for it I can attest he really does the   Bible talks about that to pray for that   that he would equip you with what you   need for those moments and whenever   Moses went back with God see that's the   difference he went back with God he   didn't just go back as Moses he went   back with the Father so maybe it's that   insecurity that you're holding on to   press past it was the next thing the   I've got this sir pride is normally the   downfall for this time they think their   plan is better than God's plan and King   Saul I know I mentioned him before but   here really is the   prime example for this because he   literally was like okay yeah I hear your   plan but then he disobeyed the plan   because he felt like he had this amazing   plan to keep all these awesome animals   for themselves and sometimes we do that   we're like kind of following God's plan   but then we see a better situation for   ourself and we're like well honey let me   just take a little left turn real fast   because that would be really appealing   that would be really nice and we get off   track what God is wanting us to do and   it says in the Bible God wish he had   never called him and found a new king   because here's the important thing to   understand when God calls us to   something it's for his kingdom purpose   it's not for our platform it's not for   our financial blessing it's for his   kingdom purpose and we don't always   understand why he calls us to certain   things we won't always understand why he   asked us to do certain things because   most of the time it's not gonna make   worldly sense but its heavens view like   when God called Moses Moses was probably   like why me I had this speech problem   why would you choose me but here God   sees that he's the one that pharaoh   would listen to cuz he lived in his   house for years you see God has this   plan and he can see it from a way bigger   of you than we can and so we have to   trust his plan even when it doesn't make   sense and no like without a shadow of a   doubt that we will humble ourself to   exalt his name and our plan will not be   better than his even if you have to   remind yourself of that every day remind   yourself that's an X that compares this   just mostly a girl struggle but I think   guys go through this too sometimes he   says this person has a call from God but   it's normally too distracted thinking   other people's calls are better than   theirs anybody relate to that you don't   have to raise your hand but thank you   for those who did because I know people   relate to that I mean I think a lot of   women definitely do because of Instagram   you know you sit around you're like oh   god I mean I would totally do anything   for kena but I'm not gonna be used like   her or I don't have as many followers as   her I couldn't really do that because I   don't look like this person or   this person or had that personality or   whatever it is or I whatever it is we   could cut with a million things and   believe it or not it's actually   something the Bible who kind of got   distracted by somebody else's call and   that's Peter Simon Peter is such a   legend and he walks so close with Jesus   they were Bros best friends and then we   all know right before Jesus was   crucified Peter denied Jesus three times   well the amazing thing is when Jesus   came back Jesus met Simon Peter at the   Sea of Galilee and they are catching up   and they were having breakfast and all   this stuff and Jesus has this amazing   moment where he gets to redeem a   situation with Peter and ask him three   times do you love me Peter was able to   say yes you love me Peter it says you   love me Peter said yes so there's this   whole Redemption here from this denial   to this love and then right after like   literally right after this amazing   moment with Jesus Peter it says turned   around and looked back at another   disciple and it says it was the one who   laid his head on Jesus at the supper   table and it says it was the one who   beat Simon Peter to the tomb so we know   he's already taken notice of who this   guy is and it was John and it said that   Peter asked Jesus a question he said but   what about John what are you gonna do   with John like after he had this   intentional amazing moment with Jesus   instead of just soaking in this moment   Peter his response was but what are you   gonna do with John's life and it was   different than what he was gonna do with   Peters and he felt jealous of that from   his understanding he thought John was   gonna live forever and you know what   Peter did by missing that moment he went   back to all of his disciples and he told   all the other people that John was gonna   live forever and that wasn't even true   it wasn't even true he literally   misunderstood the moment so much said   his story became John's outcome maybe   and I think we do that sometimes   you know we had these amazing moments   with Jesus just like this week we're   having this amazing time and then we go   back to the other people and instead of   saying what we experienced which   we start talking about another person's   drama or gossip and we're missing our   testimony and our testimony is the most   powerful thing ever because it says   sometimes Jesus would visit towns and   when he would leave more people would   come to know him by the power of the   testimony so the hope for a conference   like this would be when it's over more   people come to Jesus because of y'all's   testimony a witness from this place but       if we're comparing it to others we're   too insecure we're too prideful we want   our own plan that's not gonna happen but   if we can just focus and fix our eyes on   our response here I am God with no   limits no distractions send me use me   whatever way you want to then we can go   on and tell our testimonies and truly be   used by God and move the city to stay   and eventually the world what's the next   one the overwhelmed I figured I needed   to put a family member in here and he   seemed like the best option uh-huh so   this type goes in strong the go in super   strong to what God has called them to   but then quickly gets overwhelmed by the   call and wants to quit so this is like   Elijah Elijah y'all know this story he   was like my God is gonna send fire down   on this mountain and he believed in he   was such a righteous man and guess what   God did like he was in this call I mean   amazing things just happened   fire just fell from heaven in front of   all of these people and like he just got   up close and personally proved like God   just proved like he is here he is moving   he is using Elijah well then right after   that lie she gets this word that Jezebel   was coming after him and he literally   freaked out so much to the point that he   runs for his life he's so over owned   he's like oh no like I could handle the   whole fire thing and believing I was   gonna do that but somebody's gonna kill   me and he like screams and runs like we   do that too   we can't go in everything seems exciting   everything's going like real okay God we   would heard you here we heard you hear   there's a success here to says here we   see that you're moving on this and   there's   there's a little observation there's   like a hater on Instagram there's a   moment where somebody says it's not   gonna work really like you're probably   right yeah yeah I'm just gonna tap out   and we can't do that we can't quit there   we get so overwhelmed but listen to how   sweet it was but the Lord did in this   moment he whispered to Elijah he came   and he whispered to him it says that he   told Elijah he was gonna meet him on   this mountain he wasn't in the fire he   wasn't a store he wasn't in any of these   big things he actually was just in the   simple whisper and I wanted to put that   story in there because I wanted to   encourage you when you feel overwhelmed   you have to draw so near to the Lord   that you will hear the whisper don't get   distracted by the noise don't get   because you will be overwhelmed don't   get distracted about how big the the   room is or the stage or how big the   moment is or the calling is or whatever   because if you fix your eyes on God I   promise you he's a lot bigger and   whatever word he's gonna speak to you is   gonna be so sweet and so filled with   peace that you're gonna be able to trust   him for the next thing guys there have   been so many times I felt so overwhelmed   this year I spoke at passion I was like   so nervous it was I mean I was so   humbled to get to even stand in that   room and when Louie initially asked me   to speak I was like are you sure like I   mean there are so many amazing people   who could say so many amazing things I   know what your speak and they asked me a   year in advance and I'm not kidding I   prayed every single day and sought the   Lord every single day and I felt like I   had so many whispers that the stage did   not actually overwhelmed by the time I   was there and I know that might sound   crazy because we were saying you you   felt very confident and I actually say I   really was but not because I felt   capable of that moment at all the reason   I felt confident is because I didn't   feel capable at all and that's why I   knew it had to be God and I think in   those moments where you feel overwhelmed   sometimes those are the most confident   you can be because you can say truly I   would not be able to do this and less it   is you God and unless your spirit comes   through but you have to listen to the   whisper because those whispers are gonna   keep you confident all right what's the   next one the whole look backers this   makes me laugh so   this is the type that gets really   excited about what is gonna do God's   gonna do then you're getting stuck in   the past   they typically struggle with shame and   then they get hesitant and not sure if   the life God has for them would be   better than the one that they have so   the only person I was thinking about in   this is Lot's wife unfortunately she   turned into salt no you're not gonna   turn into salt if you look back but I do   want to encourage you with this because   I feel like we do this too you know we   get so far or whatever I feel like God   is about to do something big and then we   start looking back at all the things   that we've done and we start to feel   shame and we think can God really use me   can God really do something with this   story and a lot of the times we stop   right there and we go straight back to   what we were doing and we convinced   herself a why we can't move forward   because of our past or we think I don't   really know if what God has to offer me   is gonna be better than what I'm doing   now I'm having a lot of fun party I'm   having a lot of fun being the cool   person having a lot of fun doing things   I just make me feel numb some of us have   convinced ourselves that were there and   so we'd go back to what we've known   after something like this but I would   encourage you if you're the first person   and you think because of what you've   done God can't use you that is like the   big I don't even know how that got like   so twisted from this to that lie because   if you read these stories   everybody had a past everybody had   something that they had done that you   would think would maybe disqualify them   if you were looking from a super   religious point of view but the   greatness the great love of God and what   he did through Jesus is there's grace   Redemption and there's a moving forward   there's like a repentance in a turning   point that you literally get to move   forward and go on to live a life for   Jesus not for your will but for his to   be done like the whole story is that and   so that's just the biggest twisted lie   yes I can use you God used saw God used   Peter after denying him God used Moses   after being more afraid of his own   Security's God use so many people he use   prostitutes he used like so many people   he used me like you could look at   yourself you could look at every   preacher anybody if he can use us   absolutely 100 percent he can use you he   is just that good and then for the   second one is the life that God has   really gonna be better   I mean 1000% I'll just say from my   personal experience our family did have   a TV show it was successful we were able   to go on to do different things I was   able to go on a dance with the Stars I   was able to do some modeling things do   things that the world would think we're   really cool and I'm gonna tell you it   was really empty and I don't just say   that to say that where I am now I say   that in a very very real place when I   was on Dan Smith stars it was so fun it   really was but I was like not in the   right place and I had never experienced   more anxiety and I'm not gonna say that   there were amazing moments there were   amazing moments but the comments from   people and the hatred I was getting from   a very few amount of people in   comparison to the it was maybe 1% of a   hundred percent of good comments it was   really affecting me to the point I got   so insecure   I started struggling with an eating   disorder shortly after and I'm only   saying that to tell you the reality of   when you walk in the world's weight yes   it can look cool yes it can look   exciting and at times it can be but it's   not filling it will not fill your soul   and when you are an influencer and all   these people are looking at you if you   don't have something to say you feel   like a hypocrite and I'm say that in a   very real way because I want you to   understand the minute I said yeah this   is great but there's gotta be something   more and found Jesus and started talking   about him   I've never been more confident in my   life I've never had more joy never had   more peace never felt more loved   now do I still have haters absolutely do   they get to me not really because it   really doesn't matter people all the   time you don't like the number one thing   I get is that people hate my voice but   you know what   how God uses me so if I was to listen to   that then I wouldn't be able to be used   by God and when I felt hard to do and so   you can't let that stop you what I'm   saying is everything God has to offer us   so much more everything God has to offer   is so much more and it's so much more   filling and the last one this is the   move makers I just had to put Simone   biles because she's the goat and we can   all look up to her but she this is what   I'm saying for this time it's   characterized by faith they hear the   voice of God and respond and obedience   these are the ones that say Here I am   God with no limits to who you are with   no distractions send me now we see this   with the disciples the disciples all   responded they dropped everything they   had they felt like God we see this would   know it would Joseph Joshua David   Ananias who literally got called to go   lay hands and pray for Saul the guy who   used to persecute Christians and he did   we see knew this through so many people   in the Bible go read Hebrews 11 and the   most famous we see this with Jesus these   are all people that move by the Spirit   of God the hand of God was on them and   so I want to encourage you with that was   saying if you read the Bible you're   gonna see all the nine types and you're   also going to see all those other eight   and those are some of the ones that   became the move makers so does it matter   if you've been the one that's been in   insecurity if you've been the one that's   dealing with pride even the one that's   dealing with the shame of the past   everybody by the end of today can become   the one that says here I am God no   limits no distractions and your tomorrow   will look a whole lot different so I   thought of three pieces of advice I   wanted to leave y'all with just based on   things that I walked through in my life   because I just wanted this to be so   personal and the reason being is because   events like this when I was here last   year it got me so excited because it was   so similar to where I was at and I know   the impact these things can make when   you actually listen and you actually   respond because I would not be here if I   wasn't in this type of room writing the   things I was   I'll never forget the journal that I had   in this room I still have it it was the   first time I ever wrote in a journal   maybe I could do like a tour or   something and maybe I could just start   traveling around and speaking to people   about Jesus and we could call it live   original and now years later we've done   three tours written books and all these   things but it started responding to God   in a room just like this while I was   worshiping I was hearing the Lord people   were praying when I was coming up and   responding these rooms matter but it's   what you do from here that really   matters and so the three things that I   thought over these things you will   probably feel called before you feel   ready some of you are feeling called to   do things right now and you really don't   feel ready to do them let me encourage   you by this when I started getting asked   to speak places I told you I didn't feel   like I was capable of speaking let me   tell you I actually who was it when I   showed out to the first place I was   gonna speak this is me okay I'm just   gonna do it I kid you not I was supposed   to speak for 30 minutes I spoke for five   and the people asked for their money   back that is not a joke literally they   asked for their money back and guess   what that happened twice two times   places asked for their money back after   I left from speaking when I first   started because I was really that   nervous and I would get up there and I   would totally freeze and I would be like   God loves you oh gosh your goodbyes like   I was awkward as all get-out but doing   this the good Lord used me during that   and training me to humble myself and   that gosh I was gonna get humble no   matter what but just to keep saying yes   keep saying yes if you fall get back up   you know what there's like a proven fact   that if you fall in front of people you   get back out like 10 times faster very   true I fell in front of a lot of people   it get up faster you learn faster I've   been in the spotlight since I was 13   years old I've had a lot of fails but   man God is so graceful and he keeps   picking me back up with him and teaching   me as we go and now I can sit here and   be confident to talk to y'all freely and   you know just flow and talk about   whatever because I'm so confident how he   his word you know and so you you train   you train with him he teaches you don't   just respond one time you respond every   single day and so I want to encourage   you about that if you don't feel ready   for what you're called to you're in a   lot of good company and you got to start   somewhere and it's okay to start now   even when you're this young because   think about it if you start now how   awesome won't you be whenever you're 40   50 60 you know don't wait till you're   then started doing it now okay what's   the next one you will most likely have a   revelation of what you feel like God   wants you to do before you have a   realization of what he's actually going   to do now I know this is a mouthful but   the other day I felt like this was so   specific the Lord spoke to me as I was   journaling for this event and I say this   because a revelation is something that   like all the sudden you're just aware of   your life huh feel like I'm supposed to   do this and then a realization is like   an actual fact of what's happening when   I had a revelation of what I felt like I   always want me to do I'm sitting here   and I'm like I feel like God maybe wants   me to go on to where I'm gonna speak to   people maybe I'll call it live original   I don't really know like I never thought   until I was standing in those rooms I   had a realization that he was actually   gonna do it   like I never thought it was gonna be   what it was gonna be at the time yes we   had a following but not like I do now I   didn't know the place I would have never   thought I was faking it passion I would   never thought I would speak here I would   never thought I'd go on to do this but   that revelation was strong enough for me   to say I needed to start tapping into   that and I didn't start training I need   to start learning I need a start reading   Scripture I'm gonna stop listening to   other music Ellison to stop watching   shows i watch because I need to saturate   myself in the Word of God   I wouldn't know the stories I know today   had I not done that years ago when I   felt a revelation before I had a   realization just like Noah Noah had a   revelation who I needed a built-in Ark   the Lord told him that but he couldn't   have possibly had a realization of what   that actually meant until rain came but   thank God he started building an ark and   responding to God from the revelation   before the realization came and he   didn't have anything to go on we have to   listen and pay attention to that   relation and start asking God teach me   what I'm supposed to do with this before   I get to the moment where I'm gonna need   to actually be confident interesting   what you're gonna do through it the last   one this is so important the majority   the time spent walking out the call will   be in private I think a lot of people   think you know my life with the Lord has   mostly lived out public   oh no maybe 5% it has to be private if   you want it whatever whatever you're   doing in private it will come out in   public ask my dad the other day I said   what advice would you give for people   who are wanting to go into becoming like   a celebrity or any kind of Fame and he   said I would tell them first of all you   really need to think about it before you   do it he said but I would tell them this   I'd say whoever you are now you will   just be a magnified version of yourself   in public so if you're greedy if you're   selfish if you're angry if you're   jealous whatever you are you will be a   magnified on TV version of that because   you can't really hide who you are and so   if privately if you're soaking in this   word and reading this word and studying   this word and worshipping the Lord and   listening to the Lord and journaling   with the Lord and sitting and hearing   the whisper of God then publicly that is   the only thing that's gonna be able to   flow out of your lips because that's   what's within you and what's within you   from the heart will be the overflow of   life but if you're not and you expect to   just know it all and be it all whenever   you get on the platform it just won't   happen and so I encourage you study pray   respond but don't wait to respond just   in public spaces respond today but then   respond in the private moments every   single day when you wake up and so I   want to end this and I just wanna pray   and I know this is such a casual talk it   was learning my story to you what I've   seen God do and hopefully that   encouraged you to say yes to the call   that he has done and that he's calling   you in your own life but I want to pray   and I want us to give it a mo   to respond does it pray I just want   everybody to bow their heads and close   your eyes and let's just have a moment   where we can actually take some time to   respond   the first response I want to pray for   simply the one we talked about and some   of you might have already done this this   week you don't have to raise your hand   if you already feel it you'd respond to   God I only want you to raise your hand   if you truly feel like I've actually   never responded to the original call of   God just to believe that Jesus is the   Son of God who came to die on the cross   to forgive me of my sins he was   resurrected and now his spirit can live   in me if you've never responded to the   gospel of Jesus Christ today I just want   to give you a moment to do that because   that is the first response before you   will ever respond to the Spirit of God   so if that's you today raise your hand   amazing   hands all around at this moment I just   want you to take some time and I'll just   lead you in a prayer but really pray   your own prayer just say Jesus thank you   for coming and dying on the cross thank   you for forgiving my sin god I thank you   for being a God of love that would send   your son to die for me God today I lay   down my life my will my agenda and I   want to live for you and you alone God   or send your spirit into my heart and   what I learned to obey it every day for   those who responded that we're gonna   celebrate you in a minute   but now everybody keep your heads bowed   and your eyes closed some of you have   felt a specific call that God's called   you to it I don't know what type you   were how your response has been maybe   it's been fear maybe it's been shame   maybe it's been the past shame   no I don't know what it's been maybe   it's been doubt but today you're like   actually I'm laying all that aside and   today I want to respond here I am God   with no more limits to who you are with   no more distractions around me from who   you are   send to me if that's here today I just   want you to raise your hand   amazing you can put your hands down and   I'm gonna pray over everybody today but   I just want you to know if that's you   and you raise your hand   everything should change obedience has   to start rising up and let God teach you   ask God for the faith to believe what   he's gonna do ask God how to obey His   Word ask God to convict you of your   righteousness pray the hard prayers   because when he sends you be ready to   take a step god I thank you so much for   what you're doing in this room god I   thank you so much for the responses god   I thank you that all of these people are   saying I believe you I'm responding to   you I want to walk with you and god I   pray that your spirit would meet them   right where they're at God God I thank   you that there is never gonna be another   day that they can believe the lie that   they're alone that they're not loved   they're not cherished because God you   have a plan for them and I know you're   walking with them lord I pray that   Hebrews 10:35 or than if they would not   forget the confident trust so they have   in you for that will be richly rewarded   God and I pray that the moments that   they get to the places that you're   calling to go that that confident trust   would rise up in the moment for them to   continue to follow through and obey the   will that you have in their life god I   pray through this response that we would   begin to see Kingdom on earth God I pray   through this response that after this   event more people would come to know the   name of Jesus Christ because of the   testimonies they'll walk out of this   room god I pray that this here I am the   sin   actually is sent and there are move   makers God Lord I know we pray for the   move of God but I strongly believe we   are the move and so god I pray that we   would move we would be sent we would   activate faith among our generation   among the world god I pray that whenever   we have kids that they wouldn't know our   generation as this anxious generation   this depressed generation this selfie   generation but they would know the   generation of a generation who turned to   You God and who believed that you had   more for us and then your fullness came   so God I pray that that would be what   we're known for   because of these people in this room   living that out god I pray over tonight   I think you've heard Jimmy and his   message that he's gonna preach and God I   just pray that you would by your spirit   flow through him go through the worship   and continue to activate responses   throughout tonight and tomorrow's church   God we love you we praise you and we   celebrate all of these responses towards   your name and your name we pray amen   amen   good evening ladies and gentlemen good   evening ladies and gentlemen it's a   beautiful evening and we are all here to   celebrate

huff you are my   greatest and most evident touch of   heaven on earth   I see so many good things in you that   I've had the blessing of seeing in some   amazing men in my life you're sweet like   babish act a go-getter like Papa Howard   your love for the word is like Peppa   fill you seek and learn like to Baba and   you are confident and fun like my dad I   adore all these things in me but most   importantly you are so much like Jesus   in that let's change my life          one of my favorite verses is first John   4:12 no one has ever seen God but if we   love one another god abides in us and   his          thank you for letting me see him every   day through the way that you love me   people asked me when I knew that you   were the one there were two moments that   come to mind one was on our very first   date when you cranked up the music in   the car - yeah by Usher and waited for   me to get up and dance and the most   crowded parking lot in Nashville you   didn't care who was watching for your   eyes really liked on me laughing and   having fun   and it is two of my favorite things that   day your eyes and your humor   I always tell you I love your eyes not   just for how beautiful they are but for   what they seek and what they find          you were so intention on every way   you're not distracted by a crowd your   life quickly became my favorite sound   and your smile still makes me giddy   the other moment was when I called to   tell you that I'm sorry but I would not   be able to date you in the moment   because I need to focus on to her          you said never apologize for the things   God is doing in my life          and then you stated if it is a win for   the kingdom and a win for you then it's   a win for me          so that leads me to my first promise I   promise that if it's a win for God and a   win for you then it will always be a win   for me          I want you to know that you don't have   to hide because my desire is to know all   of you and my commitment is to always   love all of you          I promise to never put an expectation on   you or our life together to be perfect I   know we live in an imperfect world and   we are both imperfect people but I   choose to learn from God's perfect love   to love you the best I can          seventy times seven will be the   measurement of forgiveness          tonight I throw my fear gets a win so   that I will not hesitate to give you the   life and the love within me through   every moment in my life          I promise no matter where God takes us   or what life throws at us I will not let   my circumstances determine the joy of   our life or dress as we say about   everyday this is the day that the Lord   is made I will rejoice and be glad in it   today is the easiest day of our life to   Richard's          just thank you so much for all of our   family and friends here coming to   celebrate what you've done God and pray   that God through the way that we love

you we thank you for   this day ready today even made we were   what fam welcome back to the whoa that's   good hi cast I am thrilled today because   this has been a long time coming   I finally had passed your Alec Seeley on   the podcast and I couldn't be more   excited because people don't always know   this I do tell like half the people I   talk to but alex is actually part of the   reason why I started speaking I saw her   speak and preach one day and I was like   wow I didn't pack tin my life so much it   was the first time I responded to an   altar call and from there God just began   to speak to me about speaking like she   did and preaching and so Alex I'm   thrilled to have you on the podcast   you're so special to me          I am so honored and I was actually   thinking about the other day when I   first met you in the greenroom with Lisa   Nelson after that night and I remember   thinking just how special you are and to   see what God has done in your life is an   absolute Beauty sign and a wonder and   I'm just honored to have played a small   part in that initial launch yeah not so   crazy I know thinking about to that I   guess I was like 17 and I had no idea   where God was about to take me or any of   us but before I get to the question that   I asked everybody I also just want to   say and then I got to actually go to the   belonging to your church and you and   Henry for those who don't know they lead   a church called the belonging in   Nashville and I got to go there when I   lived in Nashville and I love that   church just the heart of worship I'm   telling you is amazing so so cool it got   had in store from that little moment   yeah I love it all right so let's get to   the question we asked everybody we   always ask them what that's good what is   the best piece of advice that you have   ever been given well that's a big   question it is it's loaded I know the   thing that will always come back around   was the very first piece of advice that   I got given I was 21 years of age when I   started in ministry full-time vocation   and I remember I just come out of Bible   College I thought I could take on the   world I thought that you know this is it   my time has come and I remember starting   on my first day in my mentor who I was   actually taking her position she sat me   down and she said Alex I've got one   piece of advice for you in life and in   ministry and it's just this always keep   a sweet spirit well and I remember at   the time going yeah sweet spirit what's   that it'd be bitter about my life is   awesome I'm just about to but I didn't   realize how pertinent that piece of   advice was now I'm 47 and how many times   that piece of advice has resonated in my   life when adversity has come when   injustice has come when   trail has come when disappointment has   come that piece of advice is Alex heap a   sweet spirit about you   that's so good well that's beautiful too   you know one of my favorite parts by   asking that question is because it's so   cool like most people that are on the   podcast have some sort of a platform and   so a lot of people get to see their life   from afar you know you recognize things   in people but you don't really know   where that comes from and so like I know   you I've seen you from afar and up close   and let you have such a sweet spirit and   so to backtrack all the way to 21 when   somebody told you that and you actually   took it and applied it is so cool and   that's what you know I hope people do on   this podcast like they hear something   like that and then they take it in their   own life and they're like oh yeah one   time Alex Neeley said that she you know   was given this piece of advice and then   they become that sweet spirited person   too and so I love that that is amazing   one of just the coolest things about you   and your family is that y'all are from   Australia and you move over to the   States which is like a huge thing you   start a church and a lot of people know   the belonging as their belonging like   y'all had this amazing album that went   out it's a big church but not everybody   knows like kind of how y'all start and   so I thought it'd be cool just to give   you a minute to just kind of share your   story of y'all moving and kind of   starting the church and what that looked   like yeah absolutely it's kind of a   crazy story my husband and I had been in   ministry like I said since I was 21 and   we moved we felt the call of God to just   leave everything behind in Australia   which is a crazy notion but God   confirmed it by giving us a green card   so we packed everything up and we moved   to Nashville Tennessee and we didn't   know what on earth God was doing because   we'd been serving a ministry for like   just under 20 years and we thought we're   going to be there forever and so we'd   always been second in charge you know   always helping our senior pastors and   when we moved to America it was quite   daunting because we knew nobody   we have no job lined up and we were just   living off our life savings Henry was   he's a record producer and mix engineer   and so he got about doing his work but   for me I've always been in ministry   I came to the south and realized that   there was no place for me in any of the   churches but what we discovered in that   year in 2012 was the lack of pastoral   care for the music community and the   artists that were traveling from   Wednesday through to Monday and they   weren't in church and something awakened   in me where I saw a need where there   were these sheep without a shepherd   and it looked quite harassed and needed   just needed a place a soft place to fall   and a safe place to worship and so we   accidentally started a church and a lot   of people don't believe us when we say   that but we really did we just opened up   our home on a Tuesday night and it was   kind of like a Bible study and I would   share the word and Henry would lead   worship and honestly Sadie I invited   five people and that was it   from 5:00 it just kept growing every   week people would just stop piling in   people that we didn't even know would   knock on our door saying somebody told   us about this place we never gave out   our address we never did anything it was   like the acts Church awesome and we saw   within a year over a hundred people and   then God spoke and confirmed and said   guys I don't know if you're aware about   this but this is a church and you need a   plan and you need to lead it and the   rest is history and Wow now we've got a   big jet amazing I love it I love that   nothing about it really is that   traditional I mean it's just awesome   you're right and so the extra I remember   Laney and I Laney one of my best friends   and we were roommates oh never we   started going to the belonging and I'm   not kidding we would dance into church   like we were like so we were touring   yeah and so we were like where we gonna   go to church well their belonging is   Tuesday night and I mean we would dance   people in the parking lot like these   people are going to Disneyworld that we   would be so excited just because God is   just he's always in every place he's   everywhere but just and y'all just   invite a space to just recognize that   he's here and it's amazing and so I love   it I love the church I love what y'all   do I want to talk to you a little bit   about   TaylorMade because she wrote this   amazing book cut tailor-made also the   opposite life so you're an author of two   books right now well just truth for now   I feel like you got a lot more coming   I'm on a bit of a break to are amazing   and tailor-made specifically I want to   talk to you about because I think it   goes along with kind of the message of   my ministry which is just live original   and it's about just being the original   person God created you to be but I   started to think about like TaylorMade   is that it's like another level of that   like how you're going to be able to live   original is by getting the message that   you wrote and tailor-made by knocking   these labels off your life and so   absolutely I think it's really timely   even to talk about what you wrote yes I   just wrote a book called live and I   worked on it for like two years and it   came out right before quarantine Wow and   it was really crazy because people were   saying like Sadie do you think it's kind   of weird that you wrote this book that's   like the subtitle is to have an exciting   and fulfilling life and now we're   quarantine and I like keep saying to   everybody that has said that unlike I   actually think it is perfect timing it   is so good I mean because the book is   about choosing life whenever you don't   want to when it doesn't seem like it has   value or meaning it's not doesn't feel   worth celebrating and so for you writing   a book like Taylor Made and looking at   the times were in how do you think kind   of that message could help people right   now with with where we're at yeah it was   funny I was actually thinking about how   I how I should relaunched the book   because I think more than ever right now   when people don't understand their   identity in Christ yep they let every   other voice every other bit of noise   dictate who they're becoming and who   they are and God has called each and   every one of us uniquely with a   perfectly structured mission that if we   know who we are and we remove the labels   that everybody has put on us and let me   tell you right from the get-go   it's an enemy assignment to keep you   silent and small so that you do not live   out your god-given   Destinee we are all meant to reflect a   facet of the nature and the image of God   when we don't know who we are and we   live under a certain label that that   kills us effectively yeah we don't rise   up to be who we are called to be and   that is a disservice to humanity it's a   disservice to one another because what   we're doing is we're letting the enemy   when we are being silent shut down and   then gods like hold on a minute   I created you to be a world changer I   created you to do something and everyone   has something unique stop looking to the   left stop comparing to the right yeah we   all have something unique so would you   just know who I say you are rather than   whatever society says you are whatever   culture says you are one of your parents   say you are if you've had a negative   experience your teachers your church   leaders whatever it is we've all had a   negative word placed on us and sometimes   the negative word speaks louder than   what God says and we've got to listen to   what God says that's so good a man for   people who maybe haven't read the Bible   aren't Christian haven't been Church and   they hear these things like believe who   God says that you are what are some of   those things that God says we are just   from reading the word knowing the word   and speaking it over your kids and   people's life like what are those things   that that you kind of hold on to as   label is that that God has put on us   yeah I think first and foremost we're a   son and a daughter of the Living God   whether you are a believer yet or not   you were made in the image of God and he   is our Father and when we understand   that we're made in an image of a great   majestic glorious King we have an   inheritance and we are heirs of that   therefore there's something special   about us and so I tell my kids all the   time I birthed you you are made in the   image of the father it's gay is the one   that not he knows your destiny better   than I do I can guide you and help you   discover but he put gifts inside of you   he put talents inside of you   put passions inside of you he formed all   of that in my womb that had nothing to   do with me I was just a carrier and a   birther of you but who you are was   actually formed before the foundations   of the world God had you in mind before   humanity even existed and he said you're   going to be born at this time and this   is what I've set you out to do so Psalm   139 actually talks about that we were   fashioned and formed in our mother's   womb and that he wrote every one of our   days in a book before they even came to   be so whether you know God or not there   is a book with your name on it and it   has details of what you're supposed to   do but the only way we get to know how   to do that is if we get to know our   maker and so that's the powerful thought   that someone greater than the world made   you with purpose in mind that's so cool   I believe that that is going to speak to   a lot of people right now that God made   you with purpose in mind that we all   have a purpose and were created for a   purpose by purpose and so it's amazing   for you and your own life even to me you   know you're such an inspiration I   respect you so much and just love the   way that you live your life just so open   and everything and I know you talked   about this in the book some and and you   preach about this but for you even   though you were 21 whenever so you were   young whenever you went to ministry when   was it for you that you really started   to take God at His Word like you started   to realize like wait a second this is   who God says I am and then you know that   boldness and you got confidence and you   kind of activate it because when you see   you preach you see the boldness you see   the confidence the authority that you   truly believe what you're saying but   when is it for you that you had that   like aha revelation that this is this is   real yeah well it was two moments in my   life had two pivotal awakenings and the   first one was when I was 11 years of age   and I got saved and I'd been brought up   in a Christian home but I'd never   actually heard the gospel that you   needed to repent and ask Jesus to you   know forgive you and enter into a   relationship and so for me I   physically I remember it like it was   yesterday I physically felt the weight   of sin and shame lift off me at the age   of eleven now I had not only done   anything wrong   that's why it's not about the deeds of   our flesh it's actually just about the   whole notion that we were all born   sinners and that we're separated from   God   and that when salvation takes place true   salvation and this is actually an issue   I have in the church I think we've put   in a preference for Jesus rather than a   picking up your cross and becoming a   disciple leaving everything behind so   you've had a true radical encounter with   Jesus your life is never the same so I   was 11 years of age I got filled and   baptized with the Holy Spirit a week   later and I became a mini evangelist in   my school I went to a Catholic private   school and I just began to tell   everybody about Jesus and something   changed in me but because there were   fractures and broken pieces in my life I   grew up where my mum was beautiful and   amazing and she is still to this day   she's one of my best friends but there   were some fractures in her life and so   just through a pattern of abuse and   physical abuse and verbal abuse I was   quite a fracture little girl so I had   this encounter with God but then I   believed these awful labels that I was   reject that I was stupid and that I   didn't really have a place in this world   so there was this tension and I feel   like this is gonna speak to someone   today because it's almost like well   that's great for you pastor Alex but I'm   broken and I feel unworthy and in part I   did too and so it wasn't until I was   actually I think I just turned 20 in I   just had kind of toyed with what my   heart is still broken I love Jesus with   all my heart but I still feel stuck and   it was when I was 20 that I drew this   line in the sand in my bedroom and I   said God if you're really who you say   you are and I really do have this call   of God on my life and I give you   everything because I'm tired of living   this kind of seesaw up one day down the   next and I remember the Holy Spirit just   saying in my heart just saying Alex I   need you to give me a hundred percent   cause you've only given me 90   hmm and I said what does that mean he   goes that means lay down your life and   give it all that means I'm going to need   some of those friends that you have to   go I'm going to need that relationship   that you're in to go because that's an   idol in your life I'm going to need you   to go after me like you've never gone   after something in your life and I   remember putting a line in my carpet and   I stepped over and I said Jesus I give   you my life and I cry when I think about   it because I I have never looked back   you know I'm 47 and I've never seen God   forsake me I've never that's why I'm   passionate it's it's still fresh to me   it's still alive to me because he took   this little broken girl and said watch   what I'll do with the surrendered life   watch what I'll do with a young person   who says it's all about Jesus and I'm   leaving everything behind and honestly   it's why today I get up every morning   people go you never a stale with your   faith I'm not God because every day is a   new mercy for me every day is a new   mercy and so I just love Jesus with a   passion and I've got to tell everyone   about him I love it I love it so much   you can see it it's so evident in your   life and that passion has touched so   many people including mine which ended   up touching so many more people too and   so thank you for that I will never   forget that actually that was what I   noticed that day when I saw you preach I   was like every word and that's what I   tell people I was like the difference in   my life   is whenever I responded that day because   when I saw you preach I was like every   word she says matters like every word   she says she truly believes it's gonna   change someone's life and it did and I   was like thinking about my own words   with the platform that I had I was like   am i saying words that matter am i   saying words that change people's heart   that change people's lives and like   bring them to Jesus bring them to love   bring them to joy and am I even   passionate or confident in what I'm   saying because if I'm not saying that I   might not be very confident and   passionate and so when I started to talk   about Jesus I started to talk about just   what he's done for me and me giving and   I actually truly like you said like pick   my cross changing my life everything   shifting like I was no longer afraid to   speak because I had so much passion I   was no longer free to speak I was so   confident when I was saying and so I can   just a test of what you're saying like   when you truly give your life to Christ   and you you don't go back you know you   truly pick up your cross everything   changes and that passion is contagious   its contagious   absolutely yeah I think it was what the   disciples were like it's why they died   for the cause of Christ because they   didn't counted something that changed   their lives so they were like everybody   needs this and this is what I why I   believe that even God said Henry and I   to Nashville because when we arrived   here I felt the church as a whole was   very complacent and very like it was   like entertain me yeah rather than   making disciples and so we've been very   diligent to make disciples   that's so not just entertain people and   let Christianity be a smorgasbord option   yeah it actually be the only option yeah   I love that and you know it's crazy I   think a lot of people from the outside   they might look at the blind because   they see like you know celebrities there   or yeah well who and they might think   like oh that would be a church that   would bring the entertainment yeah but   it's not I mean I told somebody every   time you go to the belonging you leave   like not just like fed you leave like   convicted in a good way and like you you   want action to spark in your life   because you and Henry both like when   y'all lead y'all lead in such a way   where you really lead the church like   you really lead your church to become   better and more like the church and the   Bride of Christ and it's really really   empowering and really powerful because   when you step in you're like man I'm a   part of the church yeah which is awesome   and so actually it was talking to   Christian about you know what I was   going to talk to you about and I shoulda   asked you something just about the   church because you know when stuff comes   up in life that we're going through   globally or in our world or in our state   or in our community you never shy away   from really speaking into it and I know   a lots going on right now in our world   and so I just wonder what are you and   this time like talking to your kids   about talking to the church   talking to the people that you pastor   because you know some people listening   they might not go to a church I'm gonna   have a home church right now none of us   are really going to a church and so just   at from a pastor's perspective what are   you kind of speaking into people's   hearts right now yeah well there's   obviously a two-fold thing that's   happening right now in our world and   that's obviously this pandemic that's   one thing and so we've been what I feel   so proud about our church is so many   people have even we've been talking   about this that I feel like we've   prepared our church that no matter what   the circumstances come our way what   circumstances come our way nothing will   move us and so I've watched our church   be resilient and move forward and not   fall apart in this season it's been   incredible to be nimble and flexible and   move with the Holy Spirit we're so used   to moving and ebbing and flowing with   God that this has not taken us out us   and our church you know those that have   lost jobs or those that have lost   incomes those that have actually had   their lives turned upside down and not   taken out and so we've prepared our   church that God is still on the throne   he's never let the right just be   Forsaken and that he covers our needs   and when you know like even just in   terms of giving nothing has changed   people are still sowing into the kingdom   why because they realize whether we're   in plenty or in luck I could do all   things through Christ who strengthens me   so that's been one good thing the only   thing right now is we're dealing with   this racial tension on epic proportions   and so yesterday I was able to preach to   the church and talk about the day of   Pentecost and actually how the day of   Pentecost was the birth of the way Jesus   wanted church to look like and that was   every nation under heaven in one place   and he decides to pour out his spirit   like he promised in Joel 2:28 that every   tribe in every tongue heard the wonders   of God in their own language and I think   God was very intentional about saying   this is how I want my church to look   like that one spiritual language that   fell in that upper room now   translates into everybody hearing the   gospel in their own language he wasn't   wanting anybody to change who they are   culturally he just wanted us to be one   in spirit and so now we're leading our   church we need to be a voice for the   voiceless we need to be a church that   stands up and stands against the demonic   realm of racism division hate and if the   church does not do it then no one else   will and I believe that we are in   unprecedented times that we get to   change church history in the area of   racism and so we're standing and I'm   teaching my kids that we have a voice   and that we stand in unity and and   things are going to change for the   better and so I'm excited about the   future it's going to take a lot of work   it's going to take consistency but we're   going to see change so great Alex I love   that I love whenever you preach because   you bring a lot of hope and also just   actual practical advice on what to do   and yeah it's really encouraging oh and   with this a lot of times I like to pull   one of my favorite piece of advice that   I received from you learn from you heard   from you and it's crazy because I had   written this down there their day just   to quote and you pretty much just said   it and you said our words form our world   I love that and I think it's really   powerful and impactful whenever we   starting to think about that I mean we   know that our tongue holds the power of   life and death the word talks about that   and you just talked about how that   you're teaching your kids or teaching   Church that we have a voice and like the   church right now has a huge we need to   be using her words we need to be using   our voice and so yeah I'm so encouraged   by you I am so inspired and I just know   that this is gonna help so many people   everybody out there listening I just   pray that you would take these words to   heart pray about the meditate on them   ask God how you can be a part of that   change how you can be a part of becoming   even learning more about his word about   what he says about you to be more   confident and the words that you're   choosing and saying and so Alex thank   you so much for being a part of this   podcast I know that this is gonna bless   so many people owe us so welcome it's

be on the podcast   and you know how like when you go into   the dms like you can   see if you've ever sent that person a   message yeah   i found a message that i sent you from   2015   yes   and i was like hey girl i like saw you   at the dubs tonight and i was like   are you gonna be at winter jam would   love to hang out with you   this is like literally five years ago i   sent this to you   so glad that we're finally getting to   talk but we've obviously gotten to hang   out several other times and i'm very   thankful for that but i was laughing so   hard i was like wow that's embarrassing   oh my gosh no i love that kind of stuff   i   when i tell you it's just what we were   talking about i am the world's   worst at any of that i feel like fans   will   go on and i'm like okay i need to go   look at the instagram   dms and just like even just spend an   hour just like looking at it or   30 minutes looking at it yeah i can   barely figure out i'm like now what is   your primary   wait what is your general i'm like i'm a   salsa i'm so lost   but um you know what sadie i love i   don't know if this has ever happened to   you   but this has happened to me where it's   almost like   god gives you um   almost a foreshadowing if you will of   the   the people that are going to be in your   life i've had those moments where   like people that i admired or   that inspired me or encouraged me on a   hard day um   it's crazy how at some point in life you   have   intersections with them and you're like   wow like five years ago god did this   and i i remember how influential that   was to me in that moment   and now we're friends like it's just i   don't know   how to explain it and it's not like like   for everybody listening   that might sound like yeah a celebrity   of some or whatever no it's like god   yeah literally predestines in your heart   like he says   yeah hey i'm gonna make you love   the connection with me through this   person yeah and   then all of a sudden he brings them into   your life like i remember   i was in high school   and i loved hillsong united like loved   loved love the first song i ever sang in   church was hosanna by hillsong   from that they were like would you lead   worship   for the youth group and so me and my   friends we would lead worship every   wednesday night   and we would just find like hillsong   worship hillsong united after   song after song after song and   i remember thinking like the highlight   of my life would just be   either like to see them live or to   go to one of their events or something   like that and like   or and then once i got into the music   industry the thing that's crazy   is um they asked me to tour with them   and i just remember thinking like god   you are so funny   that you write on my heart like this   deep connection with you through that   music   and then later in my life allow me to to   partner with what they were doing   so cool it's crazy i feel like i feel   like that   i love that i know i totally feel like   that and i love that you're so right   it's not like   a celebrity thing it really is like such   a god thing i remember   because the reason why i remember you   from the dove awards   um and honestly i didn't really know   much about christian music the first   time i went to the devil awards   we were kind of there because of dark   dynasty and we hadn't really been   like totally involved in the christian   um   industry world and so i just didn't   really know a lot of people but   back five years ago which is crazy just   to show how much the lord's done in my   life but i was just a very like   timid worshipper i guess i was honestly   thinking about myself too much i like i   never like   raised my hands and worshipped like i   just didn't feel the like emotion   and worship um because of just like a   lot of different like religious things   from my past and   anyways i'm at the devil words and you   were sitting in front of me and you were   worshiping with like just your heart   abandoned to the lord and   i just remember thinking like wow like i   want to have that freedom whenever i   worship and   um through several different things in   my life and really just having real   encounters with the lord   no i could not care who's watching i'll   worship like crazy by myself   and in front of people just because i   love the lord and the worship's so free   but i remember seeing that influence in   you   and that's really cool because i know   like a lot of girls obviously look up to   you   um because you know of all the songs   you've written and the things that you   do   but i just looked up to you before even   really knowing   much of like who you were to the world   just who you were   in person and that was really cool and   then obviously i fell in love with your   music and stuff but   i do think that was such a god thing i   saw that and i was like man i want to be   like that and you inspired me in that   moment and you continued to   so thanks for just being you it's   awesome   and you do encourage so many people like   i said you really have been the most   requested person on the podcast and   that's just   not just because you're cool or famous   which you are but it's because   so many people look up to you and the   words that you've written have   literally brought them to the heart of   worship so it's awesome   but i wanted to ask you the question we   ask everybody on the podcast to kick it   off   and the question is what's the best   piece of advice that you've been given   or   or a good piece of advice that you've   been given lately and the reason i ask   this is just because   most people on the podcast are people   that give advice to everybody else   and i think it's cool to hear what   advice they were given that kind of   influences them to be who they are and   so   anything sticking out to you from from   recently okay i think about this all the   time   it's not exactly recent as far as like   the   past like two weeks or something but   recent as far as this phase of my life   i remember i think it was like my   maybe it was like my third or fourth   tour i was ever on   i was with this guy his name is jason   gray and um   we were on the tour bus and he said to   me he was going through a really really   hard   kind of place in life and uh he had to   get   some counseling through that season and   he   told me in the best of ways he said um   lauren true freedom is giving people the   permission to misunderstand you   wow and i'll say it again just because   if you're like me   and like mildly adhd when like   the one-liners are dropped you're like   can you say it one more time please   so truth freedom is giving   someone the permission to misunderstand   you   well and that to me   has been so um so key and influential   because   a lot of times i'll take it from a few   different standpoints but   um a lot of times like offense   the other like another piece of advice   in the midst of that piece of advice is   like   offense is taken it's not given yeah   and so whenever you think about   people that you could be offending by   being   who you are um a lot of times   that can cause you to limit your   expressivity   or just who you are like the way god had   wired you the way god made you   when you're looking over your shoulder   like is this going to be accepted or is   that going to be accepted or will i be   liked   for being this way or will i be rejected   for being this way you know   um i feel like when you have   your identity in christ like on lock and   when you've   you've kind of paved that road and that   changes like there's always a right turn   then there's a left turn then there's   like a   curve you know but you're when you're on   that road   of knowing your identity and knowing you   know   who you are and him and kind of what he   has uniquely designed you guys   um you start to find that looking over   your shoulder   for acceptance and approval starts to   get   a little less and a little less with   each like risk if you will   um of being yourself and so i think i   was going through   you know when so many people are   looking at you and when you realize like   the platform is responsibility too like   it's not just   oh wow this is cool like i got to ride   on a tour bus and sing some songs and   there we go when you realize like no   your words   you will be held accountable for and in   pretty intense ways like   um my friend those words consistently   ring true   like not only in   okay when i'm in an interview ie right   now yeah or and i   you know and i botch something or i say   the wrong thing and it   gets taken in the wrong context or   whatever   um do i walk away and and   toil and labor and spin over that or do   i accept the fact that you know what   there was a moment of humanity that   slipped in there and   thank god for his goodness that he sees   my heart and he knows   all that is wrapped up in it you know   yeah um so   and so it's really it can be in those   intense moments but it can also be as   simple as like   i know a lot of people you know   concerned about what to wear   okay right and when i when i dress for   the day am i dressing because it's like   what i love to look like and   what makes me feel free or yeah is it   because i want   certain people to pay attention and yeah   i want people to   like me you know and none of those   and of themselves are actually bad it's   just when it actually comes and   takes away from the uniqueness of who   you are yeah um   and honestly what that ends up becoming   is   a stifling of boldness and   i feel like god delights in   the meek and he also delights the lights   in in boldness   and definitely like with the way that   the world is right now like   boldness is something that is to be   um protected and treasured and and cared   for   and nourished you know yeah and so   when you give people the permission to   misunderstand   it's saying this is this is what god has   placed inside of me this is the way he's   wired me to be these are the truth that   i stand upon   right and if you misunderstand it's okay   i will give you the luxury   of my permission to mis to take who i   am and turn it in a way that maybe   you only you can you know but yeah and   then the flip side is to love people   once they have misunderstood you yeah is   to still be there and to still say   god like that person in   they could have hurt me or they could um   have taken what i've said and ran with   it and allowed it to offend them or   become   you know something painful between us   um but it really is saying even   in that i'm gonna choose to love and to   bless   and to move forward with um good   intentions towards that person   that's so good wow that's so huge   honestly   i'm like taking a lot in right now for   my own heart   me a friend were just talking the other   day and we were talking about like our   biggest   like irrational fear like what's the   biggest thing that you're afraid of   that's just kind of irrational and she   said i think my biggest fear is honestly   being misunderstood   and wow we both just kind of talked   about that like   that feeling of being misunderstood is   so hard and it's so hard to swallow   but if you can get past the fear of that   and like   allow people to misunderstand you the   freedom you would feel like   what you're saying is so huge and it's   really cool that you said that because   i just shared with you why i asked   people the best piece of advice they've   been given it's normally because   it's what you know we see in you anyways   and it's something that somebody shared   and this has never been more   on point because my first like question   i was gonna   talk to you about was how you were like   the most   like free and fun and like fearless   person and that watch you and like   you just you don't let other people   his opinion or anything like seem to   really shake who you are and so   it was just like so spot on that you   literally   just said all of that because if i were   to say how do you do all that   it goes right back to that allowing   people   it's okay to misunderstand me and so   that way you can fully lift   free and have be your fun self and   be fearless in the way that you dress   and speak and   act and i just think that was so cool   that that's probably never played out so   perfectly that was really cool   that was awesome and i wanted to   ask um just along those lines because   you talked about like what people say   about you what people think about you   um i want to talk about you say you know   that that song like   literally wrecked the world like i   thought it was so cool as like a friend   i was like cheering you on left and   right every time i heard it on   any tv show or anytime in the car   i also belted it out not nearly as good   as you but   the words were just like everything i   wanted to clear over my   life um and what so many other people   even people who weren't christians that   were just like yes like   that's genuinely what every human wants   to believe that like   somebody says that they're loved and   that they belong and that they're all of   those things and   um you know whenever i write anything   whether it's a book or a blog or a   message like   getting to the words that i write like   it takes something for me like i have to   believe it first right like   something has to hit me like in a god   way for me to be like okay like   i believe this before i can ever go like   sing it or   write it or speak it or whatever and so   for you like   where did those words you say like come   from and how did you like   what was that moment like for you to   actually believe those things that   pretty much everybody in the world that   craves to   creates to believe okay so this is god   in his humor   that everything in this podcast is   connecting so good   ironically that came from the dev   awards um literally what started off   with this whole conversation but   yeah i was at the dev awards it was my   very first time there   and um i remember   like and okay tell me if you ever had   this   kind of thing go on but um   i remember feeling like   wow okay there's lights everywhere   there's cameras everywhere um   and there's just a piece of me that is a   longing for home like i'm just   longing for the girl that i once was   before all of this happened um and   at that point i was like kind of in the   crosshairs   so it was like how can it be come out   um but it wasn't quite   the magnitude of look up child you know   like i knew i was right on the cusp   and i remember just um   like the next day i had a co-write with   my producers and i walked in   and i was like i don't i don't know like   i can't   change for this like i don't want to   lose who i am   to change in order to fit what this   demands and like   what this looks like you know being in   the music industry   and um i remember that wrestle like   it was like staring back at the swamp   and like just   wishing that i could go out on the boat   or something   and like just genuinely missing that   way of life while being surrounded by   like tons of pressure lots of   expectation   a lot of demand and like i mean   louisiana people are so low-key like   we we really just are like we just have   a passion for simplicity   and we delight in each other you know   and so   when i was like all of a sudden thrust   into this world where it's just like   high demand high pressure high   expectation   i felt lost in the shuffle and i could   see where   it was going to take away from the girl   that i was in louisiana   and so kind of sitting at that   crosshairs   my producer said you need to just   replace all the lies and all the doubt   of what you're going into it was   definitely the fear of the unknown as   well   right um like replace all the lies and   all the doubt with the truth   and that's how we wrote the song like   wow point blank   like everything that uh was   tripping me up or was causing doubt or   causing me to be afraid of   taking a step forward yeah we just kind   of spoke   to those lies and wrote them with like   and it all goes back to identity like   when we   go into the bible and we see the   promises of who god says   we are like that allows our   identity and him to richen and to be   enhanced i don't even know if regen's a   word but i like it   i went with it to be enhanced   enriching there you go and um   is that even a word i don't know who   cares bottom line is it sounds like a   word   it does it's like fancy louisiana   vernacular thank you   um so it just once you know those   promises   right um it allows your identity to   become deeper and deeper   and then in that you know   who you can be walking in in this world   right like how to kind of take step by   step by step   um you know   so good that was so good honestly it's   really cool lauren to hear   the back story on that um because it's   so like   the song already felt really personal   but now it feels even more personal   because   i remember feeling the exact same way it   was like right after dancing with the   stars and   i just felt like where the world   and even life and even god like even   where it was   all pulling me i thought it was gonna   mean like me having to change a lot of   who i   am and what i love and i didn't want to   change that like i   i felt really comfortable uh here in   louisiana   and my small school that i love and   playing basketball and like you said you   said it so right   there's a passion for simplicity and   just family dinners and just being   here and just being uh low-key and all   of those things and i just um   i love that and i remember just feeling   that tug and being really afraid of it   and   i remember um just kind of getting on my   knees one day and just   being really honest with god and being   like god i think you chose the wrong   person because i do not fit this mold   i am not meant for fame i am definitely   not meant for hollywood   i do not want to move to california all   that i did not i'm not   not realizing that that wasn't even what   really god was calling me to   um that was just the route that i had   seen you know taken from so many and   thinking that was gonna happen to me and   wouldn't even be able to stand it and   all of those things and in those prayers   so that's when the word of god became   so true to my life and i was like okay   wow like   everything that you say in this world i   can take that personally and like   i can become just actually who   i'm meant to be in you and that doesn't   have to look anything like the world   and i can be confident in that and i   remember reading hebrews 10 35 and it   says so then do not forget the confident   trust that you have in the lord for that   will be richly rewarding   and just kind of taking him at his word   and all those things and   it's just really cool because i feel   like you know for both of us our story   happened to be like this moment of like   fame that brought us to this   moment of like who do you say i am but   the truth is like that song   literally meets everybody right where   they're at because   it's the same problem that we all go   through that wrestle with our identity   the wrestle with our confidence to   wrestle with   are we loved are we enough do we belong   um all of those different things and   everybody faces that like if you're   famous that kind of is like   you know it might not be like the crock   pot it's like the instant pot you know   it's like all of a sudden you kind of   feel it all rising really fast but in   life   it's a crock pot of all the things   you're gonna face those things and so   it's just so cool to know that that was   came from a time like that and that you   truly define your identity from god and   like   you can see how that's carried you   through highs and lows of   of everyday life and i would encourage   anybody listening you know   take that song take the words of god   take the scripture personally   because when you find your identity in   him you know it doesn't really matter   where he's taking you you can trust that   it's going to be good and   even if it's not what you thought it was   going to be for your own life like   finding not comfortability because it's   not going to be   comfortable but contentment in him is   going to   be i mean god's going to be able to use   you in so many more ways than you ever   could have thought for yourself   and i'm so glad that you know we decided   to trust him with that but man   um it is it is hard but those words   definitely do like sing over so many   people   um for where they're at and i love that   um i want to talk to you too about can i   just mention like the highs and lows of   life because yeah   definitely there are highs and lows in   life in 2020 we've hit some   we've hit some lows for sure and just   some some craziness   not that there hasn't been good things   that have come out but you know for you   i know that you were expecting to go on   like this world   tour um i was expected to be in london   all summer preaching and it was just   like kind of it   seemed like it was going to be this high   of a year and then everything got   cancelled and so for you like how do you   shift that expectation to like okay this   is what it thought it was gonna be but   now this is what it   is and it's kind of even like in life i   thought i was gonna be living in   louisiana doing this and now i'm doing   this like how do you   constantly navigate that shifting um   that maybe god takes you through a life   takes you through to just find like   a solid ground for where you're at okay   that is the question of   the century because i'm i   am someone like when i mean i hate   change like   i hate transition i hate change i do not   handle   it well whatsoever and um   in the moment like like big time change   i'm i'm pretty good at i can navigate   and like lead people through it   and then once like i'm done with the   leading aspect   it's like okay now i'm going to go in my   room and   like get on my knees and be like god   what are you doing   yeah um but so   for me like especially with this year i   was just at my house the other day just   kind of walking around and just thinking   and praying and um i remember locking a   door and i don't know what the   significance of that is but i'm   sure god will reveal it to me but there   was like   i was either walking in out of the door   or locking the door or whatever   and as i was doing that god   it was like in the dialogue i was just   like god   you had me on a path   that was finally at the apex   of what i had built since i was a kid   like what you had placed inside of me   since i was a little girl   it was finally meeting its fullest   potential and i said and then   it all stopped and i'll say that in this   regard like   i was i remember being a little girl   and hearing celine dion and hearing   whitney houston and hearing these   vocals that were just like out of   control and   thinking i wonder what that must be like   and you know telling people at five   years old i want to be a singer when i   grow up and then   well i i got to high school and i ended   up getting sick   with an illness and that made me on   homebound   and if anybody knows my story they've   heard that a million times it's like   almost   it's almost like how much more am i   going to talk about that but it was such   an influential   time you know and so um i   got sick and i was actually headed   towards like an academic route like   going to be a doctor   and when i was sick it was kind of when   god stilled me   and the passion for music   came back up and um it it kind of went   from like a pipe   dream idea to like oh i think this is   what god is like   asking of me like like come on let's do   this and so   um i remember like having visions like i   would   have visions about um   tour buses and stages in different   like arenas and all these things and   then i end up getting signed and then we   start touring and doing all of it   and it wasn't until this tour   that i saw what was in the dream   like wow like we had finally got to the   point of what   god was showing me as far as like a   touring perspective is   concerned and so i was like   lord i am i'm a little   dumbfounded like right talk about the   rug being ripped out because this wasn't   a part of the vision that you showed me   like yeah   but i think um i'm pretty   in these scenarios my grandmother kind   of taught me this like   whenever you have something difficult   it is 100 than making lemonade out of   lemons   like yeah it is your job and your   responsibility in life   to keep the positive perspective on   things   and so like i'm saying you as in me like   that's what she instilled in me   and it doesn't mean that you're not   gonna have hard days it doesn't mean   that you're not gonna say god   okay when is this gonna be over like   please for the love can we not have to   wear masks for the rest of our lives   like it doesn't mean that there aren't   these other things that   um aren't going to come it doesn't mean   there's not going to be restless nights   it doesn't mean that   there's got not going to be moments of   sorrow   like at a lost dream or something   you know i mean i think about all the   people who are graduating   like extreme tenures of   you know studying like i know a lot of   med students that had just finished med   school and didn't get to have a match   day and didn't get to have a graduation   and yeah kids that were in high school   and like basically when you're in the   fourth grade you start dreaming about   your high school graduation so like   thinking about all the time um that   you've been dreaming about something and   then the rug getting ripped out from   underneath you   and that dream looks like it's dead but   god has this beautiful way of   always giving back what seems like the   locusts have stolen   like he is so faithful in that   and so i've said okay god show me the   lemonade   show me how to like what is the recipe   like show me the recipe   and the recipe for me has been like   reconnecting with friends that i wasn't   as in touch with like you know how we i   started like a girls group   once a week we get on facetime and we   just like talk about life talk about   current events   we pray together we read the word and   it's just like   something that i hope continues even   when i go into touring because   you know it's kept me really connected   to friends and   when life gets harder when like you know   people talk about the end times or talk   about   you know the government or whatever like   who   who are gonna be the people that stand   beside you to hold you accountable   yeah like the ones that will say hey   this is that scripture don't you   remember it   this is the way we have to live like   this is the way we must walk   um and so i think it   for me the recipe was to make lemonade   get with your friends again like refresh   those relationships that   have been needed to be watered for quite   some time like ever since you went   touring like you've been needing to   water these friendships and then on the   flip side   like acknowledging the fact that i've   gotten to spend so much more time with   family   yeah and like you know   i have my grandfather's in the hospital   um   one of my other family members had a   baby and it's just like   the things that are really dear um   actually getting to be present for and   not just like   look past and say well but i could be in   brazil right now   i could like actually right now i think   i'm supposed to be in tokyo   you know i this was the first time i was   ever doing   a full world tour where we were going to   every continent except for antarctica   you know   and so i i was really looking forward to   that but   i know the promise that god says   and the truth and the validity that he   works all things out for the good of   those who love him and are   according to his purpose we hear it so   much but it's definitely in times like   this   where you're like god i know that   everything that feels like it's stolen   i know everything that feels like it has   been robbed   you will give me the grace and the   ability   to see the good in it you'll give me the   ability when the anxiety comes of like   how much longer you know people think   i'm just like   free and silly and all that and i am i   absolutely am   but it doesn't mean that there aren't   moments where i have for sure legit   anxiety where i'm like god i   need you to not like   when i look around and i see how much is   changing and like i said i'm the person   who hates change   when i see that like that initiates   anxiety in me   and so i say god i want to remain the   girl that dances   like i want to remain the girl that   knows how to laugh in the middle of a   storm   like how do i tend to that soil how do i   keep that   alive and alert and rich right now   because   it will be a positive perspective it   will be   a hopeful outlook that gets you from one   point to the next   whenever you feel like um the rug has   kind of been   ripped out from underneath you yeah it's   not to say that bad days aren't useful   or it's not to say that bad days aren't   helpful   but um because sometimes bad days point   you to   how much you need to keep a positive   perspective   you know and there's people that   struggle or deal with mental illness or   things like that and it is okay to have   a bad day   but to be able to pull from the truth of   god's word and say   god like you will continue me from this   point to the next like   it is your power that i will walk   through like   it is your grace that will get me to the   next step   god renew my mind like every day renew   my mind i don't want to be hostile   i don't want to be angry i don't want to   be depressed i want to stay   focused i want to be invigorated how do   i encourage other people in this time   like   what are those things that i need to do   in order to listen to your spirit in a   better way throughout this   period of time that's good um so that   for me   that's kind of the recipe on how to deal   with   different i love it at times that was a   long answer but i think   it's kind of we need it it's been a long   year it's been a long   six months so good lauren i am   so with you and it's even cool to hear   you say like yes you're   silly and fun and free and all those   things but you have legit anxiety like   same for me like i think a lot of people   and people even comment this like   how are you so happy during this time or   like   uh why would you be posting things that   are happy during this time like are you   not   like struggling or and it's not that i'm   not struggling   totally at times there are days that are   hard and there are days that are sad and   disappointing and   definitely days that anxiety can start   rising up and even i've woken up in the   night   anxious about different things you know   but at the same time like you said i   just feel like   it is up to me to like root myself in   the scripture and like   keep positive positivity in the best way   that we can   and not be naive to what's going on like   you said not be willing to sit in those   bad days and feel it for a minute and   also help other people through it but   yeah where it does said that   we are the light of the world right and   so it is kind of part of our job   to preach the light to share the light   to share jesus to share hope in the   midst of this   um and i love what you said christian   actually said to me today he's like   you know you know the bible talks about   like seeking and you will find he's like   i think in this time like more than ever   like you have to seek because   if you're not intentionally seeking then   you're gonna miss it like you're gonna   miss what god's doing but if you like   fix your eyes to seek like you're gonna   see god   even in the midst of this and he's it's   so true and he's so right   um i want to circle back uh to something   that you said that i thought was just   really cool   you were talking about like when you   were five and he started singing   and like you knew like uh i want to be a   singer but it was kind of like a side   passion you know you're like but i might   be a doctor because that's   actually what i'm good at um that was   kind of me too when i was five years old   i would   preach on the table to my parents and   they were like oh   she's you know she's a little preacher   all this stuff but like   never in a million years did i ever   think i would actually preach like no   way   i was actually banking on uh getting a   scholarship to college for   track and hoping to play basketball i   was like so dedicated to that   i didn't know what i'd do past them but   that was my goal um   and then whenever you know doug dynasty   all that started my grandpa found   a video of me preaching when i was five   and   uh it was just so crazy that that came   up during that time and   i just wanted to like share that with   people because i just wanted to   like encourage people who are listening   girls out there like don't underestimate   what god has put in you   don't underestimate what god has put in   you in a young age and the things that   you might think oh this is just   this is just silly this is just fun this   is just whatever   because god can use those little talents   and those little passions and the   purpose that you put in you in such   big ways also on the flip side don't put   an expectation of   exactly what that will look like because   you'll   you know you could think of a million   different things but his ways are going   to be higher than yours but   don't underestimate those little things   because i think god can use those things   in huge ways   and take you down roads that you never   thought you would go   so i wanted to encourage you with that   and also something i'm learning in this   time because i think a lot of you have   been asking like   how to get through these times of   quarantine and what god's teaching   and just for the sake of being on a   podcast i thought i'd share um   i was supposed to be in london and   lauren's talking about supposed to be in   tokyo and all these things and   there were these big plans ahead and i   remember at the beginning of quarantine   asking god like god like   what just happened like i thought i was   gonna be here and   why did i feel such a peace about that   why was i so excited about that like so   many   prayers went into that and as soon as i   said that to the lord like so   many prayers i just felt like such a   conviction and like i stopped and i was   like   wait a second like my prayer for london   the whole time was that the lord would   send just a   fresh revival in the young people in   london that they would just be excited   for the word and that   god's spirit would just be something   that was talked about amongst the youth   in london   and i was like wait a second like my   prayer   is still on like everything is canceled   but my prayer is still on and just   because god decided   to not use me in that place right now   doesn't mean that god's not still   working in that place right now and so i   think that that's something that i've   taken on   this year is that like maybe sometimes i   get so ahead of myself   then i'm actually like not just praying   and that's where all the power is like   beyond anything i can do like god's   gonna be the one that does the thing   and so just because everything in 2020   is canceled like prayer is still on   and god is still powerful and god is so   good and so whatever you were praying   and expecting   or maybe even not what you were praying   maybe what you were planning and   expecting that didn't work out   like shift that plans to like prayer and   see what god does during this time i   think we'll look back   and as hard as it is and as devastating   as some things will be i   do hope that we come out and years later   say man we grew so   much and we're so strengthened and   refined by   by that time even like lauren was saying   with friendships with family with   our identity and ourself what better   time to root yourself in scripture   and talk to god about who you are you   know when everything's stripped away   and so i do think some beautiful things   can come from this but lauren you're so   encouraging   i i feel really encouraged by this   conversation i want to go back and   listen   because i am the 80d person that will   miss the one-liners and be like wait i   need to listen again and write that like   everywhere   but you had so much good advice i know   people are going to be so encouraged and   strengthened   i for one and the lo team is so   for you and cheering you on so much and   everything that you do everything that   you say   also wanted to shout out i know you have   a podcast daiglebites   everybody go check out dagobytes and   ldtv   another thing that lauren has and go   follow her on instagram lauren   underscore daigle   she is a light in the world and um i   just love you think you're awesome   lawrence thank you so much   girl i love you and if it takes a   podcast for me to just hear your voice   and hear how you're doing   i'll do it any day it's so interesting   to hear from you   i wish you the best girl oh thank you   youtube friend   yep i'll see you soon bye everybody          are you ready for it well that's good   well that's bad advice i am ready for   that well that's good well it's whatever   that was that was done well that's good   well that's right advice   well that's good well that's bad advice   good job all right   so the one that's good and bad advice is   always brought to us   by the word that's good podcast   instagram where you all send in dms of   good   and bad advice all right fellow dancers   so thank you everyone who follows and   dms alright the first one we got   some people come into your life as a   blessing and some people come into your   life   as a lesson i thought that was supposed   to rhyme better than i just read it   no i think blessings i think you did a   good job i don't i don't know if it was   meant to rhyme actually   that's really good advice though yeah i   mean some people   you know definitely come in your life   whether you want to call it seasons or   a time period or whatever but certain   people um   you know just just for whatever stage of   life you're in you know people   definitely help you learn things and   teach you things and   you know sometimes you know certain   friendships last for for a long time and   some   some are short some are true some are   seasonal some are life long   yep gotta know you just summed up   everything else gonna say   well we're better as one um   it's funny actually because my dad's   been kind of roasting us for   our christianese apparently so you know   how like sometimes in the church people   say things that like nobody else in the   world really says   pivot pivot seasons seasons my tribe   all these different things and so now   we're like hyper aware when we say those   things so christian's like   well whether you call it seasons or   whatever   but i still i'm gonna say seasons and   because i don't care if my dad makes fun   of me   all right in a year from now you'll wish   you started today   there's no better time than no that's   true except for christian also likes to   inform me that you can't do everything   today   yeah that's so true yesterday was it   yesterday that we were talking about   yeah she   listed like 20 things that she was going   to do and i was like   you might do three of those because   there's only 24 hours in a day   technically 12 hours because   you sleep for like two hours so   there's not enough time as all the stuff   that you were wanting to do yeah i do   like to be well rested   i do feel like we operate better rested   okay   um but at the same time see i like to   set a big list and then if i get like a   lot of things then i'm like well hey   i might get more done setting like 20   things than i would if i set like three   things that's   yeah that's so true it's just my method   and then whatever i don't get   yeah so tomorrow tomorrow um she shoots   for the stars   yep and if you miss you'll hit the moon   is that the saying   oh man okay if you don't support me at   my worst you don't deserve me at my best          that's a hardcore just 90. if you don't   i mean it's probably true that's   probably true yeah i would say that's   probably good advice yeah you want do   you want friends who are   who love hit you worse and love you at   your best and are with you through thick   and thin   i don't know that it's good advice to   ever say that to anyone   yeah but it's a good advice to just kind   of touch it be aware like be aware of it   hey   they probably don't deserve me at best   if they can't   yeah yeah um god's way or the highway   that should be a song god's way you're   the highway   good advice could be um hope to win   but expect to lose that's good that's i   guess was kind of what we always talk   about expectations   yeah i'm surprised you said that you   never really expect to lose   that's true yeah but you also get in   life yeah you got to be humble   yeah wow i love that yeah yeah i'm   really pivoting   you are pivoting this is a new season   the season of pivot for   our drive   [Laughter]   oh man all right well thanks for sending

up women's good fam   i'm so excited for this wednesday we   have an incredible human being coming to   be on this podcast he   has a church church home a church home   app by this point you already know who   i'm talking about   judah smith uh welcome to the podcast   we're so excited to get to have a   conversation with you today   oh my gosh thank you for saying those   nice things about me i already feel   better being   being with you that's awesome i love it   i do hope that you feel   just as encouraged as everybody else   does today um but we'll start the   podcast the way that i start   off every podcast asking influential   people what's the best piece of advice   that you've   been given and i know that's a big   question but if you can think of   anything somebody said to you that stuck   with you   we'd love to hear it there's a number of   different things but this is the one i'm   going to go with today   and that is um the best advice i've   gotten   about just the world and the universe   and what it is   um is that it is it is completely about   jesus he's the main character   and the bible is actually not a   collection of principles with concepts   it's a love story and it's about a main   character and his name is jesus and the   entire universe   orients around him he is the focal point   and honestly   pain and tragedy and loss um   has uh there's a level of   um how should i say kind of   understanding that begins to fall into   place when we let the main   character be the main character and so   it's uh it's helped me in my darkest   nights i'll say that   wow that's so good when you let the main   character be the main character   that's huge i already feel like we're   going to church this is   awesome i'm like somebody needs to pause   right there and just think about that   for a minute   um so good my my questions that i had   kind of had prepared it's so funny   because this happens every time i love   the way god works   it's like everything i'm gonna ask they   you always just say   in the first thing i'm like exactly that   that is the point right there and   i was gonna talk to you about like your   passion for jesus and just kind of   asking like   because whenever i follow i've followed   you on instagram for years watched   sermons   um all the things been to church home i   love everything that you all do and   put out but something that i've always   noticed about you is just your sheer   passion for jesus and passion for people   and people around you   um and i just wanted to ask and where   does that come from where did that come   from   um when did you get super passionate   about sharing   jesus and about jesus in your own life   yeah it really was sadie for me and   thank you for saying all those nice   things they're so encouraging   um and like i said now i'm twice as   encouraged   uh this is my favorite podcast in the   history of the world i'm just going on   record to say that now this is so   encouraging but   honestly for me at 16 i kind of had this   euphoric   hyper existential experience with god   which i believe all those things are   possible it's what he does and so   he lives in a dimension called the   fourth dimension and so here i am in the   third dimension 16 years old trying to   be a basketball player because i knew   that i was the next alan iverson   and uh i i literally found myself on on   a floor of a prayer meeting not knowing   how i got on the floor   and while i was there at 16 i had a   vision of what i'm doing   um to an extent right now i saw myself   doing things and i woke up from that   and i knew he was real i knew he was   alive i knew he was a person   and i was in love with him and my life   began to day by day   take take more and more shape of of of   wanting to live like jesus and   and boy i feel less spiritual than i was   when i was 16 at 41 but   but uh um it's an awesome learning   process isn't it   that's awesome i love that and that's   probably gonna be so encouraging to   people listening who   are younger that you would even say that   about yourself   back then because you know i mean the   bible talks about don't let anyone look   down at you because you are young   and it's so hard when you're young not   to look down on yourself right and think   like   oh one day i'm gonna have it all figured   out but no it's in those times that god   that   god begins to speak he begins to give   vision and i think it's really cool to   hear what you said like i just started   walking that out day by day because i   think people get   really uh overwhelmed sometimes like   they feel like they have a vision they   have a direction from god but they're   like   how do i how how is that gonna happen   for for me and i kind of feel like for   me whenever i started feeling like   getting a sense of maybe what god was   gonna do through me or where he was   wanting me to step into it did overwhelm   me it made me   really afraid but it's that day by day   walk right of just kind of following the   footsteps following the trail the holy   spirit's whispers right   uh where is it gets you where you're   going um   i love that that's so good um for you   you are a pastor obviously at church   home if you've never been to church home   it's in   la it's amazing you've had just such a   success there and i say success not in a   way of like so many   people you've had a success for so many   people coming to know jesus right and   just really kingdom on earth moments in   the middle of   los angeles i think that's so cool and i   wanted to talk to you about that because   you know we're about to step into a new   college season and most of the people   listening to this podcast   are in college and going back to college   right now   and i think there's just fear that   people tell himself it's like okay like   how am i gonna share my love with jesus   in this like college scene right where   people don't know jesus people might not   be open to know jesus and so   i wanted to ask you i feel like you're   the perfect person to ask like how do   you get to the confidence   and who you are and what god is doing   and sharing that   no matter where you are oh man that's so   good can we just say   to every college student alive right now   and i mean this   i know that i'm given to exaggeration   and i tell everyone that i love them and   i have friends that tell me that's not   possible   and i disagree but the point is tim   tebow if you're out there you know i'm   talking about you   he gives me grief non-stop he's like   dude you can't tell everyone you love   them i'm like yes i can   tell you but anyways i think   college students are heroic and i just   got done telling my 16 and 13 year old   and sadie   same to you i have no idea   what it would be like and how   challenging it would be   to be a young person college age   teenage newly married to live in the   social media information   age and still have   a love like jesus and a lifestyle that   looks like him   i just can't even imagine i wasn't wired   for i wasn't made for it i'm 41 and   social media almost destroys my soul   i told my kids who obviously are very   minimally on social media but i said   you're my heroes i don't know how   you function but i know that god has   called like our   age is even ordained by god so god knew   that college students right now would be   college students in 2020   in the month of august so first of all   you got to go to the bank on that you   got to go wait a minute i was made for   this time i was   made for covet i was made for social   justice i was made for   you know what's happening in the world   and that's incredible and then   furthermore when it comes to sharing the   message of jesus can i just say it like   this   i've been married 20 years and it's not   the perfect marriage and i'm   certainly not the perfect husband but   i'm going to tell you right now it   doesn't take too long and you don't even   need to see the two rings on my fingers   but you're going to find out real quick   there's this lady named chelsea   and i am obsessed with her soul her body   her lifestyle her values her beauty   everything about her   and all you got to do is just run into   me somewhere and i   it's going to come out i'm married i'm   in love she's incredible do you want to   see a photo here's my kids   because it's a person i'm in   relationship with   when it comes to jesus and that's why we   have got to uncover recover   the reality of his person let us not   forget that we are here today following   jesus because   hundreds of people saw a real person   beat crucifixion   come out of the grave and levitate into   the clouds   and ever since then everyone's been   telling his story because the wild   things he taught before he beat   resurrection we were like   but the moment he beat death we were   like everything he said is true   and he's changed the world and that's   that passion which   it doesn't really know the confines of   doing evangelism which i think is great   it's just more of a i can't wait to   share this   romantic love relationship i have with   jesus   with pretty much everyone i come in   contact with in some of the most   natural ordinary ways i love that that   is   so good and it's so practical it's so   real it's so organic   and i think those are three words not a   lot of people don't really use when   sharing the gospel   or sharing jesus but when you talk about   like that love relationship that you're   just actually obsessed with that's it's   your whole life   like man that's so natural i love it i   was actually reading today um   your book um how's your soul and   something i wanted to talk to you about   was   the whole idea about love you said   something so brilliant i thought and i   want you to kind of unpack it for our   listeners and   if you are listening he's written a few   books and   the books are incredible jesus is   christian loves that book raves about   that book   whenever i was reading today about your   relationship   with chelsea and i love how you talk   about telling her you love   her and i want you to share that story   but then i kind of want you to unpack   for us that whole idea of   love is god and god is love because man   that blew my mind   and i am super passionate about   preaching about god is love i shared a   message at passion this year about   god being loved and what that looks like   because i think that you know   you know we always talk about as a young   kid like we need a dtr we need to find   the relationship and i'm like i know   paul kind of already defined love but   i think maybe we should help   re-encourage people what love really is   and   who god is and so first i'd love for   everybody to hear   you and chelsea's love story and then uh   just unpack that idea of   love is well our love story is unique   thanks for asking   it's our moms were best friends they   were pregnant together at the same time   in this place called portland oregon   it's a wild city that i'm still in love   with today   the motto of portland is keep portland   weird um but   i was born and raised in portland uh my   mom's best friend   also had a baby at around this about   three months and in those three months   um they put us in the same nursery   apparently we started playing together   and then um we uh   the plan was between these two mothers   that maybe they could have a boy and a   girl and get him married so they they   had a boy they had a girl and then they   were like   let's start plotting so every single   summer her family was the wealthy   business family uh my dad we were the   not   wealthy pastors family and they paid for   our vacation every summer   at a place called bend oregon and it's   there we fell in love when we were 11 12   13 and i have a box of notes from my   from my wife the only thing we didn't   get right is i said let's have three   kids   two girls and a boy and we ended up   having two boys and a girl so   um i was off a little there but she's   she's my only girlfriend   um it's it's wild i know but we've been   uh   that's awesome going steady since middle   school isn't that wild   amazing that is like the most ideal   situation you know you always talk about   that with your best friend like i hope   our kids fell in love that actually   happened that's so cool   it happened what's crazy sadie is we   have all these   awesome fun memories if you remember   blackbeard like you know   89 remember we watched like young   writers together when we watched like   rocky you know yeah it's cool that's   plaza   and then i mean thank you for the next   question about about love i think what's   really important for us to remember is   that god is love but love is not god   right and this is really important and i   think partially the infatuation with our   culture with the concept of love and i   say infatuation   in the most profound deepest meaning   ever because we are   obsessed with love in our culture   but of course our definition of love is   inherently   very selfish and self-serving and so   this thing we're obsessed with never   seems to deliver   because it's actually not what we were   made for we were not made in the name of   love to serve ourselves service   ourselves think about ourselves   and revolve our world around ourselves   because the bible says   that in this you know love this is love   not that we love god but that he loved   us and gave his son as a propitiation   big bible word that means he took our   place   so love defined by god is   giving yourself for   another and the bible says god doesn't   do   that that is actually who he is and the   one thing we understand about the   character of god   is god always acts in consistency with   the content of his character   so whoever he is is always how he acts   now he's the only person in the universe   who does that   it's one of the reasons i'm infatuated   i'm totally in love with him because   whatever he says   he's already did it he's doing it and   will always do it   so when it says that god is love it is a   it is a bombastic   declaration of the character of the   creator of heaven and earth that he   is by definition he is the selfless   giver he thinks about others   and yet his character is so perfect if   he only thought about himself he would   be right in doing that   but he is the definition and the   personification   of love it is who he is it is not what   he does now   conversely we oftentimes in the name of   love   we do noble acts but it's not actually   who we are or i should say it's our   actual inherent desire what jesus does   is he gives us a desire to live beyond   ourselves   let go of me myself and i   serve our fellow man be a good neighbor   love our spouse   and when you lose your life jesus says   it's there   you will find it so i truly believe   sadie if we can define and redefine love   as the person of jesus and let him set   the standard of what it is and what it   isn't   uh the world will change as we know it   amen i believe that   you're so right the world is obsessed   with love and   you talk about this in the book that   like yes because our soul   earns for that like that that's put in   us because that that   is who god is i love there's a quote in   your book and i always like to quote   people when they're on because   it's like kind of the best piece of   advice i receive but you said if any   if everyone is doing love by his or her   own definition it would be a pandemonium   and i'm like that's so true but that's   what we're doing like   we we are defining it for ourselves and   we're kind of running in blindly because   we keep redefining it as our feelings   take over and our emotions take over   and then we end up somewhere we didn't   mean to be or need to be   um but when we center on god and god   is love and we realize love is so much   bigger than this just obsession we have   but we're obsessed with god it helps   define even what love looks like in our   relationships based on the truth of his   word and so   when i was reading that i was just like   yes yes amen yes i want you to say all   that   um you know you're a super encouraging   person i think   probably by nature you're just an   encourager and   i don't know if that's that's true or   not but it seems to be you know during   this time i know a lot of people are   discouraged right there's   it's been a wild year like you can't   ignore that you can't   not see that and so i'm just wondering   for you and your life like   in your relationship with god what's   encouraging you in this time that   get keeps hope alive that keeps um you   smiling and keep you happy because i   think people are getting to the point   where they're like okay i know jesus   is real if you're a christian i know god   is real but yeah i'm so discouraged and   what is it for you that's kind of   waking you up in the morning and   reviving kind of your own heart   yeah i mean first of all thank you for   asking it's definitely that none of this   surprises god right we've got to keep   kind of saying that like none of this   surprises god god   is in control he sits in the heavens the   earth is his ottoman   and he laughs at those who oppose his   plan and purpose he laughs   because it is an impossibility to stop   the plan and purpose of god in the earth   it will come to pass his will will be   done   kingdom come will be done it's happening   as we speak   now having said that i think here's the   intersection that we're all gonna we're   all kind of either at and need to kind   of   understand biblically and that is we are   wondering   because god is eternal because god is   the forever god   because god is this he he literally   lives in a different dimension he made   the one   temporarily that we live in but there   will be a day where it'll give way to   forever forever will actually   take over time and space having said   that i think   theologically what we've done is we have   minimized   time and space what i mean by that is we   have said well it doesn't matter   and you know all this is fruitless and   all this is futile and of course   solomon before jesus before redemption   before the cross   he ends his ecclesiastes you know his   romans and ecclesiastes by saying   it doesn't matter life is fruitless fear   god keep his commandments well   that's solomon expressing a cry   for a savior to bring purpose and   definition the savior has come   so here's what we know the savior is   invested in time and space and i'll   prove that to you   the shortest verse in all the new   testament is jesus wept and yet it's one   of the most significant theological   verses we have today particularly around   our everyday life because here's the   reality when jesus wepts about three   verses later if i'm not mistaken   he raises lazarus yeah from the dead   which is the very reason he's crying   he's crying   because lazarus is dead and his closest   friends marry martha and lazarus lazarus   is dead but mary and martha the older   sisters of lazarus are   devastated in fact they told jesus   you are late and because you're late you   couldn't   heal him and now he's dead it's your   fault jesus   weeps and here's my question here's the   theological question which i think is so   pertinent right now   why does jesus cry when he knows he's   going to change the outcome   and here's why because the pain mary and   martha felt   let's call it in that verse yeah is not   any less or any less real   just because jesus is going to solve it   three verses later   and i want to say this to christians   everywhere with this view that   you know heaven's coming we're going to   get there everything's going to be fine   all this is fruitless and pointless and   we we shouldn't do any of these   initiatives and helping people and   serving people but wait a minute wait a   minute   wait a minute yes heaven's coming but   jesus   cares about right now so i just want to   say this for all those weeping for all   those hurting for all those broken   do not accept that jesus is in heaven   going   you're going to be with me forever stop   crying get over it no that's not the   jesus   the jesus you love and you serve in your   worship is with you right now in your   bedroom   he's with you right now in that car he's   with you in that park you're sitting on   that   on that blanket in in in in that central   park of your university listening to   this podcast thinking to yourself   is jesus with me and does he love me i'm   telling you the same jesus who wept with   mary and martha   over their little brother lazarus is the   same jesus that is feeling your pain   that empathizes with you that loves you   and knows your weakness   and he is not going to leave you and   i promise you he will walk through   whatever you're going through and that   continues to help me get up in the   morning and not only   know that jesus is weeping with me but   also being willing to weep with my   friends who are weeping as well   yeah i didn't mean to preach a sermon   saying i just get so excited about it   i'm so excited like   that's not just wake you up in the   morning that's like running in the   morning that is like   that is exactly what i needed to hear   that is i know   exactly what so many need to hear that   question that you asked why did jesus   weep if he knew was gonna   i've actually never thought about that   when i read the bible i like to ask   a lot of questions and think about a lot   of things that i never thought about   that but to know that jesus was with   them in their moment i mean   that is um a revelation i'm glad that   you shared with me today personally   and i i hope that so many people take   that and actually think about those   words and think about what you just said   that you're not just waiting until   heaven because sometimes i think i even   do that i'm like   okay well this world is not my home you   know like uh we used to sing this to him   like this world is not my home i'm just   a passing through and sometimes i'm like   yeah maybe i'm just like that but no   like god cares about the present moment   and just like you said earlier to the   college students that   you know god knew you were gonna be   alive in this moment like you   you're equipped for this moment there's   something in you for   this moment and all of these things i   mean even just in my own life i'm   sitting here i'm like man   i needed this like yes and amen   so i know so many people are going to be   so encouraged um   i i want to end it on that but i do just   want to ask one more thing because this   morning as i was just praying and   preparing for it   just this conversation i started to   think about so many people who aren't   christians or maybe who were and have   kind of   slipped away or just actually had not no   interest in going back to a church or   back to faith because maybe a church   hurt or maybe   a hurt between them and god or maybe   they've never even   thought about who god really is other   than what they've heard   and i was just thinking it'd be really   cool to just ask a pastor like   as a pastor when people come into your   church like   what do you hope they feel when they   leave because   i think a lot of people have this idea   of maybe what church is going to be like   or   but they've just never stepped in so   they don't know or maybe they   knew what it was or what it had been to   them and they were hurt by it so they   think all churches like that   but i feel like you redeemed so many   things for what people   who have been religious have thought of   who people who haven't   you know know anything about jesus i've   thought of you you redeem that by   setting out the gospel in such a   beautiful truthful and loving way   and so for you as a pastor when people   come into your doors and they sit in   church home like   how do you hope that they leave and what   do you hope they leave knowing   there's a story i'll make it brief   there's a story of a of an old   uh very wise brilliant college professor   and the first day   of his freshman class in this particular   university united states of america   he's uh he's doing math and he writes he   writes on the board the   i think it was a at the time it was a   chalkboard and he writes up   a math problem in the answer and it's   correct then he writes up the same math   problem in the answer and it's correct   he writes up another   math problem the same one and the answer   is correct he writes it up again   about the six or seven times this   brilliant professor writes up the same   math problem   and actually writes the wrong answer wow   chuckles begin to break out in this   elite   professor's classroom as the freshmen   begin to chuckle at the thought that the   brilliant professor   actually got his own math equation wrong   now he writes up the right equation and   the right answer again   another 15 to 20 times he turns around   to chuckles   and one courageous freshman raises his   hand and says uh professor   sir he's like yes he goes you actually   got it wrong   and he goes you're right welcome to life   wow   welcome to life you can get it right   every time   but the one time you get it wrong this   world will laugh at you   wow this world will think you are less   this world will   conclude you are dumb so   my brothers and anyone on but but i   think what he's explaining   is the dynamics of the human condition   in the human nature   you can get everything right in your   life which no one does   but the few things you do dumb even   sometimes the people you love the most   just have it in our nature to remind you   almost   you know tear you down so you don't get   a big head   and we remind each other of our   weaknesses   i want to build a community like   jesus where we remind people   not of their shortcomings and their   weaknesses   the holy spirit is so faithful and he   will   show us where to grow but the difference   between   condemnation and conviction   must we must put our arms around this   not only as   storytellers and communicators of the   gospel but jesus followers at large   we must ask ourselves are we going to   embrace conviction which by the way   conviction is this conviction is   god saying hey this isn't who you are   let's change this and everything inside   of you goes   yes let's do it condemnation says you're   an idiot   you got it wrong and you'll never do   what you think you're supposed to do i   want to build a community   where you can write up the same math   problem and get it wrong every time and   everybody in the room   jumps up surrounds you at the chalkboard   and says hey   we've got it wrong too let's do this   together   so we can get it right and we can   believe in each other and i want people   to leave church and believe that they   can   fly sadie that they can fly i don't why   don't we get to go to aladdin and think   we can fly   why can't i come to church and feel like   jesus will help me walk on water   jesus so help me do miracles because   honestly to live a life this day of   purpose you need the miraculous power   of jesus so i'm passionate and you know   what when people criticize us   let them say those people they're so   positive they're so loving they're so   kind they're so considerate   let that be their criticism and and i   i'll be okay i can sleep at night   knowing that   the criticism towards me is that i'm i   i'm too welcoming i'm too kind i'm too   encouraging i'm too it's like yep you   know what that's me   guilty great i love that so   good man i love that this podcast is   called   well that's good but it's kind of funny   sometimes because i i don't even realize   how much i said whoa that's good   i think i've said that like i think i've   replied that like five times at least   to the things that you've said but   seriously it's so   good and so helpful and i can't get over   how uh   so many things you said just made me   personally   so encouraged and so inspired to deepen   even my faith in this time what god's   doing what he's put in me for this time   and so thank you i know it's gonna help   so many people   uh judy you're the real deal you know i   just support everything that you are   doing and encourage so many people   if y'all haven't got the church home app   for those listening it's so great they   have guided prayers   um a community of people going on this   app that is a part of   i know their church home church but be a   part of it because guided prayers   marriage mondays with him and chelsea so   much encouragement and i know it'll   bless you in your daily   life and

a godly gospel   force in the universe it means the world   and thank you for having me on   thank you that means so much we love you   too and appreciate you so much   tell your family we said hi promise   hey bye thank you sadie   all right everybody all right everybody   well here's the thing well here's the   thing   are you repeating me yes i am oh my gosh   christian's not sharing the mic because   i have a hidden mic because we fancy   today   hey y'all i'm so excited because like   what did judah smith not just preach the   word   literally preached like 30 minutes   leaving the chat box if you're like   shook because we're shook i'm like if we   could raise our hand right now and just   say   amen and we'd all be raising our hands   and amen because that was church that's   church   that was straight church so good but now   we are going to get the good advice that   you guys sent into the world that's good   podcast   instagram page some good maybe some bad   we'll see what y'all chose to send in   we'll see and i also don't even know if   this mic is on because our computer died   so   true but it looks simple it looks   official though it adds to   i feel all right uh be a problem solver   not a problem announcer   that's good advice it's great i feel   like if you're a problem announcer   then you're just one of those people   that gossip and   i feel like or worried or anxious you   know there's   i feel like when there's a problem it's   normally already   known that it's a problem and sometimes   we like to just repeat the fact that   there's a problem over and over again   when it's like yeah we can't fix it   right now   you know we just need to figure out how   to solve it the world needs more problem   solvers yeah i have news for your mic   it is not working shoot i'm still going   to keep it but you can still use it i'm   still going to keep it up oh my gosh   oh this is cool life is short do at   least one thing you love every   day great advice if you're gonna take   that advice what would you do today   what i do today life is short do one   thing today that you love   that i love um drinking milkshake   i like that i drank a milkshake   yesterday i'm already on this train what   would you do   that was yesterday what would i do i'd   play tennis with everybody   oh well that's friends and family yeah   that's   uh what what no that's that's shame of   mine no that's better than my answer but   i'm thinking like we do that like every   day i don't know   emotion i know that's true i do often   but not every day   it's just getting okay okay   um you can't please everyone oh   oh yes that's true that's so cheap   that's just like fat jack like that's   just something you just take that to the   back   as judah said something he said that in   his message yeah i'm not judy even i   love what jesus said though he's like   you know if people are gonna criticize   me i hope they're criticizing me because   i'm too nice i'm too welcoming i'm too   loving i'm two of these things like   that's the best compliment if you're   like living a life like it's like what   would jesus do if i'm living a life   trying to be like jesus and people   criticize me for that then take a note   from jesus he was like well they hated   me first right yeah take heart you can't   please everyone   um i like this have a childlike faith   but a mature   attitude that is good yeah jesus talks   all   throughout the scriptures of having   faith like a child then   um you can learn a lot from children   yeah you can learn a lot from children   but i   i know that if my if i was like a child   you might lose then we probably wouldn't   be married if i was not   valid valid so yeah good advice   all right let's let's see be a warrior   not a worrier love that you guys are   sending in some   goals like we used to have like some   pretty weird advice   like not good advice but it was like   funny because we said sending good and   bad advice   and which still we like so if you've   ever gotten like super bad advice that's   like just hilarious and comical we'd   love to read it but this is like   good that's a good bumper sticker i love   that that is a bumper stick that is a   bumper sticker   all right let's see i'll do one more one   more   let me see   okay hmm there's so   there's so many   because i think that me and you would   probably disagree okay keep it simple   um i think that's is i think that's what   i'm trying to think of something because   you're trying to think what i'm going to   say differently but it's from the office   and michael asks dwight what the best   advice i've given you and then dwight   said kiss and just   keep it simple stupid that was my first   that's michael's with it's good moment   yeah that was michael   that was michael's well that's michael   scott well that's whoa   nobody loves the office more than   christian i challenge you um okay   besides his brother maybe   but and your brother and my brother okay   people do but   he loves it a lot but no i was gonna say   like i think there is   beauty to simplicity and the fact of   like even what we've seen the other day   like i will rejoice in the simple gospel   there's beauty to simplicity   but i also feel like expressing yourself   and sharing details and stuff like that   can also add a level of   um depth to stories that can   be like a connecting point for different   people but you're very simple you would   say what i would say   in 20 words and five that's so true yeah   i'm a man of   few words but jesus when he um gives his   parables   i think that he was maybe trying to i   don't know if they were trying to be   simple   but i think it makes you want to think   yeah i think he made you want to like he   wanted you to think about it   it appears simple but there's so much   there's so much richness to it that's   why you can read the same scripture like   so many times   you get something different out of it   each time yeah anyways great advice guys   so stoked um about this because i know   you are gonna have a lot of   what are you saying everyone in front of   me for a lot of little nuggets   oh nuggets to chew on   chick-fil-a over here uh it's my   pleasure   nuggets we tried to get a chick-fil-a on   sunday to get a 12 count but

questions   that you have sent   in to the dm so welcome jenny again to   the boy that's good podcast          oh this is so fun girl i love hanging   out with you so   fun i love it and i'm so excited for   this moment because   you know i feel really special and   honored just to even   be your friend have your number go on   trips with you to where i can ask you   some of these hard life questions that   i'm facing right like   anytime i have a bible question or a   thought like i   know i have access to call you and talk   to you about it and that's such a gift   in my life and so i'm really excited now   because now we're kind of opening that   up to a lot of different   girls and guys who have really sent in   dms to our   live original orwell that's good podcast   instagram page and people have   honestly asked some pretty tough   questions you can really read through   these   dms that people are really going through   some stuff and seeking wisdom   and advice so we're just gonna jump   right in um   the first question or one of the first   questions that we got   was did your history of anxiety and fear   ever impact your relationship with your   husband   or your boyfriend if so how did you   overcome it   when is the right balance of talking   about anxiety with your partner and not   overwhelming them that's such a good   question   and first of all i just want to say to   everybody listening   this word this huge word anxiety i know   it's super familiar to everybody right   now   we are in the midst of a crazy season   and   we're all feeling that so i think i   think there's this universal anxiety   right now that   that even people that don't typically   feel it have felt just because   what anxiety is is a fear of the unknown   it's a fear of   of what could happen yep and and so   that's that's i mean if there's ever   been a definition for this moment it's   that we have a lot of   unknowns and a lot of things we cannot   control   and so you know it's like this is of   course this   is the enemy we're fighting right now so   so yay for the person that asked this   because   we have to know how well first of all we   have to know that it is going to affect   our relationships   100 yeah it is you you think   that your thoughts are invisible to   people but   honestly your thoughts probably wouldn't   surprise   people because it's so true it always   comes out   in some form or fashion and what i found   is if i use my words   and say hey this is how i'm feeling   today   what i garner in that comment is a lot   of empathy   so the minute that i admit now what's   hard   hardest about that is so many of us   don't even know we're feeling that   so many of us don't even we we just have   a we're uncomfortable we're not having a   good day we're cranky we're edgy   you know but we don't ever call it what   it is which is   really we're worried about something   we're anxious about something   yeah and so i think the first step we   all have to take is just   diagnosing it ourselves and knowing you   know what this is what i'm feeling   i think where we can get in a mess with   relationships   is if we dump without   wanting to change or without wanting   help that's good and so that's where   you know there's certainly times where i   tell my husband hey i just need you to   listen like can we just sit down   for 30 minutes i don't want you to give   me any advice i just want you to listen   there are times for that but you better   set it up that way   yeah and i would say you're what you're   doing is you're providing   input right like that's why you tell   somebody is you're you're inviting   relationship you're inviting their   thoughts back into yours and so   we can't be so afraid of welcoming   other people's thoughts that that we're   just   basically constantly venting i think   that's where relationships can get   unhealthy   because if you think the answer is just   dump all of your concerns on somebody   else   and and don't you know ever allow them   to speak into it and to help you and to   get the help you need   that's going to be constant it's never   going to heal you're just going to keep   being hurt you're going to keep   dragging that person down but i would   say that   the healthiest relationships i have are   the friendships i can   i can speak and say hey this is where i   am yeah   and then i can say to them what do you   think what do you think i need to do   what do you think i need to see that i'm   not seeing   what do you think you know god thinks   about this and invite   them to bring truth into that situation   and   yeah i think we we sometimes over um   we have too high of expectations on   people to just listen perfectly   sure and to be the perfect empathetic   listener and it's like you know what   we really have to help people do that   well so we have to say this is what i   need right now   and and if it goes poorly you kind of   need to say okay so   that was thank you so much for listening   um what what i really need right now is   is advice or what i really need right   now is   is just for you to listen yeah um and   don't don't be too hard on that other   person because   all of us are a little bit of a mess and   i think healthy relationships are those   that   that can communicate your own needs and   then   also realize it may or may not um   extend past your your boyfriend or   husband's ability to deal with it right   so   certainly my husband has not been the   end-all be-all there have been times   i've needed to pull in a counselor a   mentor   a friend a girlfriend you know sometimes   it's like you know what he doesn't need   to listen to the hour-long version but i   need to tell the hour-long version   you know what i go hang out with a   girlfriend and and so i think it's just   knowing   knowing your audience you know knowing   nobody you're talking to   you're terribly disappointed in them   yeah   don't be terribly disappointed in them   if if they don't quite   hit the mark that your mom did when you   were in seventh grade and you came home   with your problems   that is so true funny story this   literally played out like two weeks ago   with me and christian   um and i love how you said like   sometimes you just have to like   tell people like this is what i need   right now like i'm about to vent or this   about to   i'm about to like say what i'm gonna say   and like i need you like i don't want   this to turn into vinnie i actually want   you to encourage me i actually want you   to challenge me   and when we don't set that up it can go   wrong like me and christian the other   day   we were coming home and i find like   whenever i get   really busy i have like a lot more   anxious thoughts because   whenever i'm not so busy like i can i   feel like i can kind of fight those a   little bit better i'm kind of more   unnoticed and more but when my life gets   busy like i   i kind of get lazy with my thoughts   right and i we were on our way home from   like   another trip we have been driving so   many places because flying's crazy right   now with covenant and we're still trying   to   do a lot of things that we had scheduled   through driving we were getting home and   i just had this moment where i was like   about to have a panic attack   and i felt like this car was following   me and i was like   told christian i'm like i feel like this   car is following me i'm getting really   freaked out about it and blah blah and i   just need to tell you   and he responds like oh no like okay   then let's go to your parents house   and i was like no i was like you're   supposed to tell me i'm being crazy and   the car is not following me   and it was just funny because he was   like trying to help me saying like   oh well if you're scared anything is   following you go to your parents house   but i wanted him to tell me like   you're being crazy that's just anxiety   talking the car's not following you go   home you're fine   but it's funny like you have to give   people the invitation to speak truth in   your life and sometimes you   have to tell them like hey like i want   you to tell me when my fear is   irrational like i   want you to tell me and challenge me   when i know it's crazy and i think for   me   you know sometimes for me like saying   stuff it's not that i really think that   it's just that i need to just like get   it out   i just need to tell somebody this is   what i'm thinking i know it's irrational   i need you to be with me and say yeah   that's kind of crazy but i still love   you   and so it was funny because that totally   played out for us the other day   in a really funny way um the next   question somebody sent in was   have you ever had to cut people out that   you love out of your life because they   were toxic to you   how did you end that relationship and do   it in a way that still honors them   and can be done in love wow this is such   a tough one   i know yes yes i have had to do that   before   and i think we've got to be really   careful to put someone in that category   because   you know we really are called to love   people in the midst of difficult   circumstances and so one of the grids i   have for   is this a relationship that needs to i   need to press through this conflict   and really fight for or is this a   friendship that   really probably needs to kind of fade   away and and i would say the first   question i   ask is um how many times have i   tried and truth to speak or in love to   speak the truth   how many times have i tried to reconcile   how many times have i   and and how has that gone in the past   right so so have they been humble have   they   wanted to change have they wanted um to   reconcile   yeah and then and then for on their side   you know have they   you know been clear communicators about   what is difficult for them   and i think there are people that you   have done that with three   four five six times and it's still   not changing at all and i don't mean   it's still you know   it's all relationships are broken all   relationships are full of two centers   so you can't have this you know   unrealistic expectation of somebody   but if you just feel like you know what   we are not getting anywhere   um i i also have another rule so that's   the first thing is how many times have   you confronted them   the second thing is is this somebody   that you need   or is this somebody that needs you if   someone doesn't fall   in one of those categories for me i   probably am not going to spend   energy and time with them i'm not saying   they're not a worthy individual   on earth and like yeah hopefully they   have those people that need them and   that that   they need but it you know   and there's just a lot of relationships   that kind of fall in this peripheral   that's kind of i mean i would call it   more than an acquaintance but   they're really not you know required in   our lives and they're really   not um somebody that is   that you're really investing in or that   and i think   when that that level of person starts   costing you a lot of energy   yeah you know that's somebody that   you're like you know what i'm just going   to kind of back   up i'm just going to kind of um i'm not   going to call as much i'm not going to   spend as much time with them   um and then you get into do you return   their calls or what do you say to them   i am so direct that is the way i'm wired   i say   pretty matter of factly and so you know   a lot of those people   we've had pretty direct conversations   about our friendship and just been like   you know what   um this isn't this isn't working anymore   yeah and   and so that's that's really hard to do   and   i prefer um it just kind of distancing a   little   um but but then here's another here's   another   situation where it gets complicated is   sometimes people think you're distancing   from them and you're not   you know so that's true that's where i   am i'm a fan of direct communication i   think you just say it you say it and   then you tell your friends   because sadie you me we're busy like we   are traveling we are doing the next   thing and so people can think   yeah you know that that we don't value   them anymore we don't need them anymore   and   and that's not true and so i've just   told my closest friends the people in   those two categories   um hey by the way i'm gonna go through   seasons where i feel distant   that's not me quitting you yes if   anything were to happen   i'll be direct and i'll tell you yep so   i think i'm gonna side with on that one   direct communication   i just think it always is because two   maybe they could grow from it and you   know what there's a lot of immature   people out there   that are going to punish you for that   that are just going to talk bad about   you   they're going to gossip and you know   what you'll live yeah you live   it's okay people can be mad at you you   can disappoint people   they can gossip about you and you can be   okay through that   you will live i love that that's so good   jenny   i agree i'm 100 for direct communication   and like you said it is   so hard and your stomach will want to   drop right before you go into those   conversations it will drop right before   you go to those conversations   but it's always so worth it even if the   end of that conversation means you both   kind of agree to say we're in different   places and that's okay and we were   friends for a time and   i'm for you in a different way now a   little bit further away but for you   um those that conversation or it ends up   resulting in an   and something that y'all hadn't actually   just needed to talk about and you mend a   relationship i think direct conversation   can go one of two ways and both normally   end up good and if it doesn't like you   said you will live   what i've realized is that like when we   spend too much time on those   relationships   that just are toxic you don't realize   how much that affects your relationships   that are healthy like   you don't realize that like when you are   so   invested in a toxic relationship and   it's taking so much energy   and thought and hurt out of you that's   the that's what you're bringing into   other relationships i remember   i walked through that for a few years   and my friend did too and   we were like we were struggling with our   friendship not because we were off but   because of   other people we were just allowing to   just we were constantly giving more time   to that than truly just the friendship   that was right in front of us that was   so from the lord that was so encouraging   that was so awesome and so i think that   you know   in order to do justice to yourself and   the people around you that you love   it is important that you have this   direct conversations that you need to   have   and know when it's time to like you said   not just leave somebody high and dry   but but walk away in a noble way right   um well and i'm thinking of a great   story i'm thinking of a great story of a   friend of mine that what she said was   to to this group of friends that she   kind of always felt like   were upset with her and disappointed in   her and she just said you know what   i don't think i'm supposed to be in this   group of friends because i think you all   have higher expectations   for each other than i can ever meet and   i care about you   but i'm just i'm gonna i'm gonna kind of   go ahead in this different direction   because i don't want to keep   disappointing you   i thought that was a really strong bold   way to kind of draw a boundary of saying   hey i don't want to keep disappointing   you i don't want to put you in that   position so i'm going to i'm going to   back up from this   that is so good wow i love that i feel   like that's going to help a lot of   people right now   because i can think about like three   friends right now that i've been having   this conversation with that that   right there is really gonna help um all   right another girl said this and   i think this is something so many people   struggle with but she said how can i   overcome thinking poorly of myself   such a big one and with thoughts and the   whole get out of your head thing   i feel like this is huge yeah i gotta   sit up for this one   um first of all what great questions my   gosh i love every one of them and   and i do think these are your team or or   somebody pick the right ones because i   know right these are the ones i bet   you're hearing all the time sadie   because i hear these all the time   um these are the categories right so um   so   how we view ourselves i would say this   the first thing i'm just going to take   people through the process here because   i think it's so helpful   is the first thing you've got to   understand is how are you viewing   yourself   i think again we walk through life with   these feelings of insecurity and   insignificance   and um and we'd never give it a name and   we never say   we never say this is what i'm feeling we   just   have all these thoughts that run wild in   our mind my son the other day   he his um his enemy is rejection   so when he feels rejection even in a   small way you know he's 12 years old   so that happens a lot when you're 12.   yeah you know   you know a daily occurrence so so when   you feel   when he feels any rejection no matter   how small it is he reacts   so dramatically and so what we've been   praying against   is the spirit of rejection that he   constantly feels and lives with and and   you know he he was adopted and so   that rejection is so deep and it came   from such a young age   yeah and the reason i tell that story is   i think we've got to realize that these   passing thoughts in our head   are coming from pretty deep places right   yeah   so so those that feeling of what you   just said that that you   that you don't value yourself this   person that wrote in the question   what what i would say to you is   the first thing is that is in direct   opposition   from the truth yep that the bible is   clear about that god   designed you and formed you and knows   every   hair on your head and he set you apart   for purposes that he created in advance   for you to do so   so the value and the worth and the   dignity not to mention he sends jesus   christ to die   for you so your worth your value who you   are is so significant   that the god of the universe would   would be you know brokenhearted   at that because it's just it's so not   true it's a lie from the enemy so   so we got to decide what lie is it like   what people don't just   feel in general bad about themselves   they they have   a bad body image well that can come from   you know   a perfectionistic father that that was   critical of you that can come from   um being surrounded constantly by people   that   talk about um their physical appearance   so so i think just narrowing down   what it is that that that   haunts you yeah now what's interesting   about the enemy his favorite thing to do   is whatever that thing is   like if you know if if to get my son to   admit that he feels rejection   that's very hard for him to do actually   yeah um   that thing is you're actually so   embarrassed about that thing   that you never want to say it out loud   well so you work   harder to cover that thing up even   though that thing whatever it is   is somewhat universal like so true   rarely have i heard   or have i said a a lie or a fear   or a sin that i didn't get head nods   pretty quickly from other people true so   it's   the that's what the enemy though is so   good at because what shame does   is shame you know will will have you say   a general thing like i have a bad   self-estee esteem   where what you really feel is rejection   from   your father or rejection from your   friendships or rejection from   guys maybe a specific guy that that was   critical of you   and so well that's the thing that's hard   to say   you know that's the thing that takes so   much vulnerability now why   why am i going so deep here because if   we don't dig out   the root of where that thing came from   and how is god supposed to heal it   well if we can't name it if we don't   know what it is and may i think   most of us know what it is but we're   afraid to say it because shame has   attached itself so   tightly to it that we hide it and then   the enemy has won   because you know this is where the book   i mean this is   my story you know i i struggled with   doubt for so long   i mean 18 months of a season of doubt   where it grew and grew and grew and i   was losing my faith literally   losing my faith and and then   i say it out loud and almost the moment   i said it out loud   there was this power that was released   from it where i wasn't alone in the dark   anymore with the devil or he could tell   me whatever he wanted   and so so my prayer and my hope is that   that we're good friends to each other   that we ask the hard questions that we   don't stop   at you don't feel good about yourself   but we really go why yep   why if you don't know if your friend is   sharing something with you   or you want to be a good friend the   greatest question you can ask is why   that's so good keep asking it and when   they say   the answer to that say but why again   like yeah keep digging you know just   keep going because there's probably a   deeper reason that that came from and   before you know it that person will be   crying i could   i could tell you because i've done this   to too many people yes they will start   crying because at some point you'll   strike the thing they don't want to say   yeah when you strike it they'll probably   cry and and this is how we friend each   other guys like this is   we we go to the deep dark place where   the devil is holding us hostage   and we say it out loud so yeah so back   to the view of ourselves   all of us um have believed that lie so   so   just so that person listening knows   it is not just you you are not alone it   is not just you   we have all bought that lie in some form   or fashion to where   um our significance has eroded from   what god did put in us as as human   beings on earth that he designed so   so you're not alone and that means you   can say it out loud and that   that somebody else can help you process   that because we need   people beside us to fight for us to help   us believe the truth   that day that i shared you know my deep   dark thing   i was with two friends and they began to   speak truth over me they fasted they   prayed for me   they fought for me as much as any two   people could   fight for me and that was the beginning   of healing for me and it's amazing   and i think we've got to realize the   enemy's involved we can't just   make this just about our thought life   sure we can't you know and that's where   my bad reviews have come in is   this is this is not you know this isn't   just about your thought lives you all   this about jesus and bible   and the devil you know because because   that's where the war is being fought and   second corinthians 10 says that it says   you know don't fight the spirit with   fleshly weapons   fight spirit with spirit because it's   good you're not we're at war with spirit   and and so that lie that you believe   that   that possibly was even planted by your   father the enemy has   has built that up and and taken that   to a place where it's grown and grown   and grown and grown and the best example   i have of this is   um i grew up with a dad that was   critical   and i struggled with an eating disorder   in   college and then really until i was a   young mom   i i struggled with it and and it was   very consuming and i didn't i wanted out   and i didn't know how to get out and i   didn't know how to view myself   yeah rightly and and i remember   um one day specifically you know going   to my dad and i'd written   all of these i really worked through it   and and found a lot of healing because   of jesus and   and counseling and all that and and then   i on the other side of that though i   take   to my dad you know i want a strong   relationship with him still   and so i take to him you know how it   felt to be around him where i always   felt   like there were arrows you know pointed   at me and   and i didn't feel safe yeah so i   expected him to either   one affirm this negative view i had of   myself like yes i was critical of you   which would be hard to hear because i i   kind of wanted to hope that   he didn't mean all that you know yeah or   he would say   i didn't say any of that or i didn't   mean any of that and then it would   not validate anything i'd been through i   was so scared to take it to him   but i knew it was obedience and i wanted   to lift that anchor in my life i didn't   want to stay   you know with this heavy thing in my   life and so so i take him this letter   and i read it to him it's six pages long   and the thing i never could have dreamed   and some of you your dads will never say   this to you but the thing i never   could have dreamed is that he cried   well and he said jenny it wasn't you   it was me well and he owned   his struggles and talked about his life   growing up and how   he was raised and and it just it was a   thing i never saw coming and i think   even if your dad or   or somebody you love doesn't have the   maturity to be able to say that i love   my dad so much for saying that   and recognizing that that's true like   like people take you know because i   don't think it's always as simple as   just   us in our heads alone thinking negative   thoughts about ourselves i think they   came from somewhere and wherever they   came from just remember that person was   broken too   yeah and somebody was critical of them   and maybe this isn't about you maybe   this is about them   well a man what a crazy   beautiful story i know i hate to say   beautiful because i know it's so hard to   walk through that for so many years   but beautiful redeeming story and now   y'all my dad is my biggest fan   is he has grown so much in that i think   it broke his heart more than it broke   mine and yeah   and that reconciliation has just been   better than i could have ever dreamed   i mean a lot of you out there i bet you   i bet you sadie a lot of people are   going to go have an important   conversation with a   relative and and i can't promise it'll   go so well   but i can promise you that god will use   it and god will be enough for you even   if it goes   poorly so true so just to encourage   everybody listening like actually think   about that   kind of like this is me saying to you   why   like why and keep going a little bit   deeper with the why you've been feeling   the way that you've been feeling because   you don't need to spend another day   having those toxic thoughts about   yourself or   thinking you're the only one struggling   with that so why why   are you thinking those things about   yourself and if you can pinpoint that   and be able to have the conversations   that you need to have like breakthroughs   gonna happen   and it's gonna look different than   jenny's story and it's gonna look   different than my story but it's gonna   be   god and your story um i remember i had a   similar   thing happen to me and it's funny   because i struggled too with   eating disorder in a way my brain was   just telling me all kinds my mind was   telling all kinds of crazy thoughts   and i kind of pinpointed it back to um   this guy i was dating and some of the   things that he spoke over me   and this also doesn't always happen but   we were able to have a conversation a   year and a half after he broke up   and he apologized and he said   the same thing he was like it was me   where i was at in that time   i was struggling so much with insecurity   and i saw what god was doing in your   life   and it was just my way of like bringing   you down a little bit you know   and it's crazy because like i would have   not ever thought   that he would have said that right and   then i struggled for so long   from being the reciprocate of all of   those things but   and so that's what happens you know   somebody speaks something and then   they're struggling and now you're   struggling and then you go years of   struggle whenever really we just have to   stop that thought we have to ask   yourself   why like jenny said uproot those things   so that god's able to heal it   um so good i want to ask two more things   um   kind of i know we're asking real kind of   heavy stuff but at the same time   when do you ever get to sit down with   danielle and have an amazing   conversation   someone who knows the word of god has   kids herself   loves this generation like this is a   rare moment so i'm asking all the hard   questions because i love it   like you said these are questions i get   all the time and sometimes i   don't know what to say honestly um   because   sometimes i'm still battling them you   know and so   i'm this is like the things i'm asking   people um   but this one particularly i've gotten a   lot   um and this one is the it says how do   you deal with intrusive thoughts   specifically in pure thought and i think   this is   another one of those things that you   kind of said it's like you know the   minute you say something you realize   like you're not the only one because   somebody will head not or be like oh   i've struggled with that too   and recently we have actually gotten a   ton of dms from girls   about struggling with pornography and   masturbation and impure thoughts   and um it's one of those things where   every one of them thinks they're the   only   one and i think it's because we talk   about   guys struggling with that a lot we don't   really talk about girls struggling   it's like a more shameful again the word   shame   thing to admit that you struggle with   but the amount of dms we get and the   amount of people that comment   i'm like i just first want everybody to   know we get a lot   you're not the only one that doesn't   mean it's okay   that you know just like fear fear is   still not we still don't want to   struggle with anxiety even though   everybody pretty much struggles with   anxiety   we still want to fight that but you're   not alone and so jenny   what are some some of the advice that   you give to people who are just   struggling with those   impure uh thoughts that just keep coming   up or that   that addiction and they feel like   they're stuck or they're only they're   the only one   well the first thing is the fact that   they're asking out loud is so   great because that that shows two things   number one it shows that they   don't have um a comfortable relationship   with that sin   they want it to change right true and   that's huge and then two   they're not in so much shame that they   won't reach out and so yeah   my thing with this is it is just like   anything else one of my best friends   this is her story and she talks about it   all the time in fact she talked about   said the word masturbation from the if   gathering stage last year or two years   ago   and it was so powerful and you cannot   believe the hundreds   of messages we got and she got from   girls saying exactly this   thank you thank you thank you for saying   it out loud because so many girls are   struggling with it so that is a big fat   lie   that you're the only one that is not   true at all so many girls in fact most   girls   in this generation are going to struggle   with it and the reason why   is because we live in such a sexualized   culture right it is   everywhere i don't even mean to see   stuff and i see it online so   you can't you can't you can't escape it   and so   you you know that that's real however we   can fight it and we can fight it really   well   and i i know that in our house um we   have   such we have really open conversations   about absolutely everything in our house   and   i would expect that i mean caroline   looks at me the other day and   you know we're just talking through all   these kind of things every day and so   she's   asking me like what would you do if i   told you blank and you know of course   immediately i'm like well tell me you   know like yeah is this your roundabout   way you know of telling me   and and so i said it really doesn't   matter what you tell me the the same   answer if it's   you know if it's any i just named   everything i hear from girls right   abortion   whatever and i just name it all yeah i   was like whatever it is   we just don't want you to be alone like   we want to go through it with you   and so i don't know how long young your   listeners are   certainly if you're in high school and   middle school i would tell a mentor   a parent somebody that is older if you   just tell your peers   they do not know what to do with it   right so true and i can't promise you   your parents or your mentor will either   but keep telling somebody until somebody   doesn't overreact and can help you   because it's good   there there are a lot of people that   that have walked through this that are   ahead of you and so you want to find   those people um also yeah if you're in   college same thing goes you want to find   somebody above   you to to share this with um and   and i think the the beauty is you know   i'm gonna go on down in um   second corinthians 10 because it says   that we have   um divine weapons that have the power to   destroy   destroy strongholds okay yeah so this   has certainly become a stronghold in a   lot of people's lives this has become an   addiction   and a stronghold and the way we fight   strongholds and addictions are a little   bit different than a negative thought   um although they're not it's not that   different we've got to be able to   um name it and and fight it right   and bring people around it and all that   but i do think   that that there are ways to fight this   that are are more drastic and i think i   go back to the verse that says   you know if your eyes causing you to   stumble you know cut off your eye now   i'm not going to say cut out your eye   because of pornography   i'm not but i'm going to say we take it   that seriously right   we really protect ourselves so you get   the software that you need to protect   your computer   you um you don't go see movies i control   my input so much so my struggle was   doubt   which um was what the enemy used to just   run   rampant in my mind and that grew if i   always exposed myself   to cynical people i had to cut out   twitter   i had to cut out movies that were really   dark   um those had would affect me for for   days and it would   i had to cut out a lot of news and   things that were secular because it just   made me   um it made me struggle with that and   make made me feel like i was dumb for   believing all this and   and so it kind of reinforced some of   those lies same things   go with anything you're addicted to if   it's alcohol if it's   um unhealthy relationships like you've   just got to draw those boundaries and be   really   good protective with those but it's not   fun and it's not sexy right like nobody   wants to   say okay i'm struggling with alcohol and   i'm never going to drink again   because i might be an alcoholic nobody   wants to say that that's a bummer you   know   you want to be able to say oh i don't   have that big of a struggle with it i   socially drink or   you know you you might need to never   have another drink of alcohol   and you may need very strict software on   your computer and your phone and   you know it's okay you know that's what   we do that's what the cutting   you know the eye out that's causing you   to stumble means is that you   you do radical things to protect   yourself so that it doesn't enslave   you and let me give you the reason why   because it's not actually that you're   going to get massively punished by god   although   there is a road to sin and death and a   road to life and peace and we want to   avoid the road to sin and death because   it causes even if we're going to be   saved eternally   it causes sin and death and destruction   in our lives any sin that we walk in   um doubt did for me it caused you know   fear of death and anxiety and all these   things grew   the road to sin and death will always   lead that direction   it's because we want to be on the road   to life and peace i mean   that's the real thing is like rather   than feeling like you know what   this road i just can't go down it i   can't go down and it's like no   build a vision of of a healthy marriage   where you're not constantly distracted   by   lust yeah outside of your marriage like   imagine that and fight for that it's   worth it   that's so great and i think you've got   it you know that's what kept me   more pure i certainly had my share of um   falling off the rails when it came to   purity but but   what what helped me the most was   actually a vision   of of peace and life   and joy and walking with god and and a   better   you know and following his way in a   better road than the road   that i was on with that's so true oh my   gosh that is so   good i'm so excited for people to listen   to that even for   me like that was so helpful that was so   helpful and i can say the same thing   chris and i have talked about this since   and christian's been open about his   story before we met   and one of the things we talked about is   i said i've always been what helped me   with purity   even though same kind of went off the   roles every now and then it wasn't   perfect but what helped me with that   to keep purity in mind was i i had this   idea   of what it would look like to just be   with my husband that peace and that love   and   just get to share that and when   christian i taught he was like that's so   cool that you thought about that like   you thought about me you thought about   our future kids   and he was sharing like i never thought   about that like i didn't consider   my wife i didn't even think that because   i was in high school you know   and i think you know if you're in high   school listening to this or you're in   middle school or   you're in college like consider your   wife consider your husband   consider your life and your relationship   with god consider your peace of mind   when you go to sleep at night if it's   like   anxiety and fear consider your peace of   mind when you go to sleep at night if   it's doubt like that's for me i   have to like i cannot watch anything   dark no movie no tv show i can't listen   to anything dark like i am so   sensitive to what i watch or what i   listen to because i know   i'm exchanging it for a piece of mind   and so   just consider those things that you're   whatever you're putting in or whatever   you're looking at whatever you're   listening to and how they're going to   affect your future   or your tonight or your tomorrow morning   because they will have an effect   for sure now but that was so good um   this is the last question and this is   also a big one   but again something so many people are   asking   it's not shocking that they're asking   because we are living in the year 2020   and it is   cray-cray um but a lot of people have   questions about the end times and this   is how   this girl phrases it so i'll read it   like her she said i have anxiety and   fear over the end times and what is   happening in her world right now   i know i shouldn't fear the end but i do   exclamation point um and i think that   that's   so real for so many people so many   people have been asking questions it   feels like the end times the end times   what do i do   all the thoughts and so i would love for   you to just give some peace to people   who   are having those overwhelming thoughts   about the end times and just   the state of the world that we're in   right now   okay well first of all i would say i   kind of feel excited by it all   i love it i do i feel really excited i   want to be alive when   when the wild things start happening   right because we want our lives to count   and so   um i i think you know the crazier it   gets the more   like some of my friends and i are kind   of like okay like game on let's go   so i think maybe we could just shift our   view of it because it's really an   honor if in our generation this began to   unfold so   so i think we we need to not be afraid   of it i think we need to be prepared for   it and we need to realize that   it's not easy and what scripture tells   us is   this is going to get worse and worse and   worse and you know i always look at my   kids and i think   is it going to get worse and worse and   worse and you all are going to be the   ones that get to usher in the kingdom   you know   um and i know i'll get to too because i   i mean i know i'll be part of it but to   be alive   on earth when when jesus comes back to   be alive on earth for the tribulation   like those kind of things that's   that's where um i think everybody's   thinking and talking   i think that would be an incredible   honor and and hard   too you know depending on where you fall   on um the rapture and   that timeline i always like to think   we're gonna get i'm always a pre-rapture   person not because necessarily i don't   see   the op the evidence for it in scripture   but i'm like might as well miss the   tribulation like if i'm gonna have to   pick   what to believe i'm like i might as well   that's awesome but   no matter where you fall on that that   we're in the middle of the tribulation   that   that we are about to start it or that um   you know it's coming and will be   raptured first i do think   that um things are are certainly growing   in their in   intensity and and we can't   deny that i remember chris kane told me   we were talking about this and   and i asked her i was like what's your   gut you know her prophetic gifts and   and she said she said well i know when   you're pregnant   and your contractions get this close   together   then it probably means the baby's about   to come   and so you know i think i think it's   it's i think we all i think every   generation including the disciples   are supposed to live true as if it's in   our generation   i think that's actually our downfall if   we don't consider that so yeah i don't   think we're melodramatic to be like this   could be   you know coming to an end and and how do   we live because of that because   again even the first generation of the   church thought that way so   so let's think that way you know and   then and then how does that make us live   but we shouldn't   fear it we should be excited for for   that because   because our god is is going at that   point it's going to make   things right right that's true that's   ultimately what's coming he's going to   make things right he's going to take us   home we're going to be with him   now the the other side the flip side of   that is   who's coming and who's not and and what   a great place for us to   you know in this conversation sadie   because there's nothing that matters   more   than giving jesus away to our generation   and true   and in light of everything we've talked   about   that's this is ultimately why we've got   to be free right   this is why we cannot be drained and   in unhealthy toxic relationships this is   why   we have to fight our anxiety and   and not live in our minds in an   unhealthy way this is why   we have to be able to name our sin and   fight it i mean we've really covered   like   like a lot of parts of life where the   enemy gets us and and gets unhealthy and   and the ultimate reason why we don't   want to be bound we don't want to be   stuck in these places so we don't want   to be in bondage   the ultimate reason is because we've got   a job to do   yeah you know it's like we will be made   if you believe in jesus christ   you're not working for your salvation   you're not working for him to be pleased   with you   you're working because you want to spend   your life well   for the glory of god because this life   is so short so it's great   so that is the most motivating reason to   be free   and to live free to be pure and to   pursue holiness is because   i don't want to waste my life i want it   to count i want   people to see my god through me i want   people to be able to go   um into the kingdom because i was you   know   showing them hope and that road to life   and peace rather than the road to sin   and death so   it's great you know that's the ultimate   motivation and i think   i don't know i just get i truly get   giddy and giggly about it i'm like   let's let's go like i love it something   in me is like let's go to war let's go   fight you know and we   are we are and and whatever generation   it comes in   it matters and and we are ushering our   generation into the kingdom even if the   end times is 10 generations from now   it will come and the work we do in our   generation will matter for eternity   hey man somebody quote that that is   so good you remind me so much of a   security guard i have one time he's   a favorite security yard ever his name   is eric   he has been with me on so many tours and   every time we go on tour he meets with   the whole tour   and he always tells everybody the same   thing every time he said   just remember if there's ever a   situation happening   if i'm running one direction you run the   other   because he says i'm gonna be running   towards the problem   and i think of you when i hear that   because you're like   just remember whatever happens i'm gonna   be running   towards the fight like you're in it   you're excited by it and   and it helps my faith as a believer i'm   like yes   i should be too like i need to have that   confidence and that courage to be   excited about those times and   yes what better thing than to be here   when jesus comes back like that would be   an   honor like you said and so i hope that   encourages so many of you out there i   know we've talked about some   stuff that i think all of you need to   hear i'm not even gonna say   it was hard it was heavy because it's   what we're going through like it's   real and so i hope you guys are so   encouraged you might need to listen to   this again take some notes   ask yourself the why and like she said   even practically   think about your future draw yourself   visions actually take what we're saying   and apply it to your life because i   believe if you do   there's so much wisdom in that and   you're going to come out as like so much   stronger in your faith   so much stronger as a person and your   relationships and   you'll truly be set free by the power of   god that he has a real life and so   jenny i'm excited i cannot wait for   people to listen to this so thank you so   much for all of your wisdom   and just being so real with

whoa   that's good podcast   we have a very special guest with us   with   with us today formerly known as sadie   robertson now she's sadie rob huff   thanks for joining us today well thanks   christian for having me on your podcast   well that's good that's such a great   concept yeah it was crazy i was doing   this q a one time and my mother-in-law   said whoa that's good and i said i   should totally start a podcast   that's good our stories are so similar   yeah it's crazy it's really blown up   it's awesome check it out he said make   sure i practice today   so sadie our fans our followers our   people our friends one they're wanting   to ask you some questions   okay be careful who you trust   salt and sugar look the same oh   that's good that is good advice that is   really good   yeah salt and sugar do look the same but   i'm telling you if you put salt in my   tea it would be disgusting   yeah but you put sugar in my tea yeah   i love that i actually think that's   really great advice be careful you trust   and it's also takes a sermon but   sometimes you don't know right off the   bat   um everything about somebody so give it   time you know sometimes it's not   like as prominent as salt being in your   tea sometimes   it takes a few sips to realize that   somebody might not be a trustworthy   person but when you find out   put the drink down for lack of a better   term um   walk away be kind be honorable but know   who the people are that you can tell   your things to and who the people are   you might just want to   be a friend too but not have to give   your heart to whoa that's really good   yeah   um i think so too i think you definitely   have to be careful with who you trust   and when i   first saw that i for i thought of um the   verse in the gospels where   um it says that they believed in jesus   because of the signs and they said he   did not entrust himself to them yeah   it's just so profound that like even   jesus like you know if you're wondering   if you can't trust it and when jesus   didn't trust people when he was on earth   yeah um so then you know give yourself   that freedom if someone   um gives you bad vibes or whatever   or they give you this bad feeling so   millennial   you don't necessarily have to you're on   my podcast right now   you don't necessarily have to trust them   yeah um but you know use wisdom and you   do want to get people to benefit the   doubt most of the time   you're good yeah don't cross me okay   it's better to ask for forgiveness than   permission   horrible yeah i don't like that i mean   if it's like not detrimental to anything   yes like but if that's your motive like   yeah   that should not be but there are times   you're like okay   okay never mind bad advice   i'm in the wrong i'm realizing i am in   the hot seat   yes don't do that ask for permission   yeah because then you won't have to ask   for forgiveness there you go   yeah thank you thank you   okay i feel like this is the problem   there is somebody in this dream right   now her name is stuff she's my friend i   keep looking at her because she knows i   do that like i do stuff and now i'm like   it's better to ask   for forgiveness so i feel like   i would not be truthful to the people   watching myself my husband or my friend   to say i have not done that   that's so true but i also think like but   i also think it can be like a sneaky   kind of thing oh yeah you know like in   our marriage like i'm not gonna like   no yeah that's that was my first year   it's not dead if it's not detrimental   bad advice but yes   also for those listening my guest today   is my wife um   this person is asking here again this is   not your podcast   this is my podcast we are one this is   our podcast who's one asking the   questions   i have the questions thank you um   i'm sure this is a question about life   maybe not that's   necessarily running way this about life   because this is life   life's a marathon not a sprint   yes life is a marathon life well   unless like you well no life is a matter   of that   these are hard because you like you   start to think super deep about it   but then you have to bring it back to   actually the question you're like okay   actually yes life is a marathon not a   spread in the grand scheme of things   yes we are like a vapor it's fast but we   also have to take life as a marathon and   like take   breaks every now and then go slow speed   up sometimes so you can't just go full   speed ahead like you will   literally crash yeah yeah it's   definitely marathon not a sprint yeah   for sure um i think you're gonna like   this one   i've seen some clips of you just from   some different things   falling down is an accident staying down   as a choice   i feel like sometimes i see you fall you   just you kind of can be kind of clumsy   sometimes mission   huh oh my gosh   you had a great you had a great quote i   saw the video of you speaking at the   global leadership conference last week   really good   um but you said something about falling   down in public can you yeah can you tell   our guests and our friends that you're   such a great interviewer christian i was   talking about falling down   and i read this thing one time and it   said for those who fall down in public   they get it twice as fast   and it's true i mean think about   physically following when you fall   like and everybody's looking through you   get up   you get your butt up quick i don't care   your whole   knee is bleeding it's scary you're a   bruised left and right you get out and   you're like that   hurt i'm fine i'm really fine really and   it's the same   when you fall emotionally or spiritually   at times like if you fall in public   it's important that you get up and a lot   of times when it is public you'll get up   twice as fast even though it's   embarrassing and it's hard   kind of helps you recover a little bit   faster but yeah i love that falling down   is yeah that's really good and i talked   about that the other day   um i think unforgiveness can have   something to do with   keeping us down a lot of times and i   talked about how like   um someone like getting the wind knocked   out of you and how somebody said   something to me one time where i just   physically felt the wind getting knocked   out of me even though nobody touched me   um like i didn't get punched but i felt   like oh i took my breath away   when that person said something so   hurtful and i feel like i   kind of face planted right you're on the   ground it's in those moments where you   have a choice you can stay on the ground   you can wallow in it and you can get   bitter and you can   live your life in that same place or you   can get back up and   that getting back up has to do with   forgiving the person that spoke that   over you   and um you know letting out that   bitterness in your heart and letting out   the seeds that they planted in your   heart so it doesn't keep you on the   ground   um and you just gotta move on i mean you   just gotta keep going because   again life is a marathon not a sprint   but it's it's definitely some sort of   running right you got to keep   going you know you can't just sit on the   sidelines and watch it go by when you   can   but that's not a way to live the only   life you've been given   that's awesome you should have my job   it's crazy that's awesome   okay all right last question just   because it's a treat we have you in the   house today   always say what you are thinking no   there is   wisdom and not speaking the bible talks   about be slow   to speak quick to listen and um what   does it say   you sort of speak quick to listen and so   to become angry yeah   so um yeah yeah i don't think it's wise   to always say what you're thinking for   sure yeah well it was a treat yeah and   the bible talks about our tongue   yeah it holds the power of life and   death so for sure   well it was a treat having you here   today i said treat   that was the second time i've said it   but thank you for being here   you are awesome and we love you   thanks guys

welcome back to the whoa   that's good podcast y'all today i am   so excited geeking out because i have   one of my family's favorite people my   dad's best friend   someone who welcomed me and to live with   him for a few months when i first moved   to nashville   you probably don't know who i'm talking   about actually by this but we have   luke bryan on the show he is such a   great guy i cannot wait to hear his   advice   and some of his funny stories and also   just go a little deeper with him   but here's the thing he has a new album   out it's called born here die here   live here luke has so much incredible   music go check it out i can't wait for   this conversation          thank you so much for taking time we are   so excited   we can jump right in to the question   that is the question of the woe that's   good podcast   what is one of the best pieces of advice   that you've ever been given   that's a that's a great question i mean   and i'm sure   in your family you've been given so much   advice oh yeah a piece of advice that   has always   stuck with me as my dad when i was a   little boy he always said   do it right the first time and you will   not have to go back   and do it over again that's good and now   have i completely lived by that you know   not   always yeah sometimes as you're   navigating life and going through   life you don't necessarily get a 10 out   of 10. but you know it's something   that's always stuck with me that my dad   said and and you know that's been a   major one but you know just   manners and being a gentleman and   politeness yeah that's good   you know the deal kind of the southern   way of being brought up and   just always putting others first and   it's good but definitely my dad's advice   was really really big for me   i love that that's so good i actually   was gonna ask you about being a dad   yourself and so we could just go right   into it um   your song build me a daddy is so sweet   it's so   awesome and powerful and emotional it's   so great but you know i've gotten the   privilege to get to see you with your   kids   and you're such a good dad and so i just   wanted to ask like   what kind of dad when you think about   you being a dad to your boys do you want   to be and what do you hope they see in   you   well i want to be inspiring for them i   want first and foremost for them to know   that   i'm a christian and i want them to see   some of that now do i   do the perfect walk with that every day   certainly not but   even just questions as they get older   about   christianity and spirituality and stuff   like that being able to have the right   answers and then i want them to be able   to see   that me and caroline are very much in   love and yeah   have fun with each other and i want them   to know that   mom and dad enjoy each other and have   fun now   we're not those parents that you know if   we have a big argument we don't go   hide and have the argument you know we   yeah we lay it all out there   right in front of them just you know   they got to learn they got to watch mom   and dad   go through life it's awesome and deal   with life's little challenges   but those are big things and then i want   them to watch me   hopefully be the best gentleman i can   and be the best   role model and inspiration and i want   them to see   me you know hustling getting up working   and love on them every chance i can   being kind and polite to people   it's awesome there's so many qualities   of my dad that i have that people come   up to me and say god   you sound just like your daddy and   anytime people come up to me and say   your boys did something that looks like   it's   exactly something you would do it's   always very exciting and flattering and   it makes you smile   that's awesome honestly just even   following you on instagram and getting   to see you up close   um we all see that you and caroline love   each other so much and i think that's   such a great example for your kids like   for me there's been so much security in   my life that's come from like seeing the   way mom and dad love each other   and they never like looked like it was   perfect right like they're the same way   like   they had the arguments some of the   arguments in front of us but they i feel   like they kind of taught us in a way how   to argue and overcome things and   see things differently about the end of   the day you know still love each other   um but one of my favorite things about   you and caroline is y'alls pranks   they are hilarious you guys have more   fun than anybody   well with us i mean i think the bottom   line is we just keep   our households really fun and   spontaneous   and what's even more fun is now the boys   you know they'll come up to me and   they're like hey dad   we want to do a prank on mama so that's   the main thing i mean you know just   keeping a very   fun family dynamic around the house and   make sure everybody's in a good positive   mood   it's awesome i love it so for you like   you are   really busy obviously i mean yes we're   in the middle of a   quarantine but at the same time you're   still doing american idol   you're still writing songs your songs   have been hit singles lately   um and i mean you're busy and so for you   like how   do you keep that family dynamic saying   so grounded and just   always you know hanging out and stuff   this year's been amazing i mean i've   gotten to spend so much time with my   family and   just waking up and sleeping in my bed   every night has been   yeah it's been you know just one of the   if there's a silver lining or a bright   spot   through everything it's just me having   the opportunity to be home even like   yesterday tate wants to play football so   i got to go   pick out all of his football gear and   bought him a helmet and stuff   it's awesome he comes home and i got it   all waiting on him and   you know in a lot of other situations   caroline would have had to be running   out   and doing dad stuff but the main thing   is coming in off the road   and just trying to be there as much as i   can you know obviously   it's a lot you know you're trying to   give all you can to your wife you're   trying to give all you can to your   children   the people that work for you your family   and then then you're trying through all   this   to have a little time for yourself so   you know it's been challenging through   the years and a lot of being   wore down and tired but yeah you just   have to hopefully make the time together   really really count   yeah it's awesome like i said for years   when i come off the road   i mean there's been many times i'll go   get the boys out of school around   1pm and go take them hunting or fishing   or something   because i knew i was going to be out of   town for several days and so   yeah sometimes it's just really   important to go grab them out of school   and just spend a couple of hours with   them   yeah it's awesome you never have the   right formula but the main thing is just   trying to keep your energy level up and   hopefully be the best dad you can and   the best husband you can   i love that it's so much intentionality   you know i think whenever we're so busy   like it just takes being   intentional and i love that like just go   get them out of school   go football shopping with them whatever   it takes to stay close as a family and   my dad he's been cooking a lot lately   you know he he's a   expert chef in the kitchen um and it's   funny because like i've always just   thought you know dad just like cooks   first that's what he does but   recently i've like noticed no dad like   intentionally cooks for us because   that's how he like   that's how he loves on us that's how we   spend time together and so   those things are so seen um you know   obviously you're   from um a really small town you um grew   up   didn't you grow up on a farm or buy a   farm   kind of farm life living yeah well i   grew up in leesburg georgia   right in town but i could walk to cotton   fields and peanut fields i mean it was   awesome ag   going on right in the city limits you   know my dad owned a fertilizer company   in a peanut meal   so in the fall we were harvesting   peanuts and   working in ag a lot so that's cool a lot   of amazing memories and a lot of just   special memories growing up in such a   small   type of environment that's awesome so   i'm assuming growing up there you   probably didn't ever think that your   life was going to pan out the way   that it did or maybe you did you know   going from that to   being um one of the biggest country   music artists and then a judge on   american idol and all the things that   you do   um for you like what gave you the   confidence to like go with the thing   that you knew you were good at cause i   think a lot of people especially   listening they're in college and they're   just now kind of at the point where they   feel like either god's put it on their   heart what they're gonna do or they're   getting really passionate about that but   what gave you the confidence   to actually just go for it you know the   main thing that   really was the motivating factor for me   to go chase my dreams   was i had a lot of support i had a lot   of support from   my family and my friends and they were   very very encouraging   while you're young that's your time to   really go for it   yeah if there's something you dream   about don't let   life in people and don't let other   little things deviate you from your past   pick that thing that you love that when   you wake up you can do it   24 7 and it never feels like work it   feels like just   it's a part of you it's awesome it took   a lot of encouraging   to get me from leesburg georgia to   nashville   but once i made the big leap i felt at   home i felt like i was finally in the   right   spot it's cool i felt like i kind of i   just saw the light   you know yeah and from that moment on my   life was just about doing what i love   and then a bunch of   amazing things started happening because   of that love of music and the love of   what i was trying to go for   yeah that's awesome i love that i love   that it came from the place of like   something you truly just loved and we're   passionate about and that the people   around you were the ones that pushed you   into it   um for you you know i think you know   sometimes when people   see you or see anybody in your position   like they see   you now and they don't know like the   story or the journey that you've been on   and so um obviously now you seem super   confident in what you do but was there   ever a point where you were like   nervous or scared uh even performing or   going to nashville   how did you overcome that fear that   might would have   wanted to tell you no don't do this this   is scary   oh my gosh i mean there's so many   different levels   of being scared i remember moving to   nashville   and meeting these other talented writers   and   singers they were so much better than me   but it really motivated me to try to   work harder and do what i can   to overachieve and be better than my   peers   you know it's amazing i mean when you   look at all of the big   hurdles along the way i mean the one   thing that was always   constant is just saying a prayer and   asking god to get you through these   challenges it's cool   there's been so many times like my first   time i performed   on the cmas you know me and my band we   we huddled up and you say a prayer wow   and you go out there and you give it   your best   that's awesome i look at so many moments   in my career where   i didn't do the best i could but   you know the people and the fans are   forgiving too and understanding that   that you don't have to try to be perfect   every day yeah well i think   when you make a mistake you own it you   apologize or   you try to handle it the best you can   and then move on and   pick up the pieces that rock on yeah   colon it's great   well like when i did the national anthem   at the super bowl i mean gosh   i bet i said a million prayers that day   and i just walked out there and somehow   survived it and now i can live to tell   about it   yeah oh that's so good like people need   to hear that because   i think people sometimes go in with this   like okay i'm not gonna be afraid if   everything goes   everything has to go right though and   then the minute something goes wrong   it's just like crumble   but no like you keep getting back up and   you got to keep going   my grandpa told me this one time i like   love it he said people who fall in   public get up twice as fast   and i was like that's so true and it's   true physically if you fall like you're   gonna get up fast if you're in front of   people and like act like it didn't hurt   but it's the same thing if you sing the   national ant   in front of the super bowl if you fall   in public like it pushes you to get up   twice as fast because   hey you got fans you got people who love   you got people who support you and   would be so sad to see you not keep   going and   since then look at how much you've done   so that's awesome um   i want to ask you because you've been   super open just with   your family and y'all's life and the   things that you've gone through and some   really really tough things and first of   all i think it's just amazing that   you're like   willing to share that with the world   because so many people are facing so   many   so many similar things like just a   friend of mine recently lost her brother   and   i know that's so hard for her but people   like you who speak out about those   things   it helps you know because people know   there's somebody else who understands   them and so i know you've lost   your siblings and you've taken in your   nieces and nephews and so   um you know we've watched you rise   up and continue to move on in that sense   of your life too   do you feel like your faith in any way   has helped you through seasons like that   and how have you just   continued to to move forward   well i think you must have faith in   god's plan   no matter how frustrating it is and no   matter how mad you want to get it god   you really just have to step back and   just   really kind of give yourself up to   well this is his plan yeah and with us   if i talk about it and i help one person   if i talk about the emotions of losing   both my siblings and and losing my   brother-in-law   and our niece i mean i think people out   there that are dealing with tragic   losses   when they can not feel alone in in the   journey of life and they can feel like   well this guy gets back up and keeps   pushing and maybe it inspires somebody i   mean   for sure even in my travels there's some   people out there that have had   tougher rougher things than me that are   out there battling every day   yeah and they're inspiring for me so   i think if you live a long beautiful   long life   you're going to have those moments for   sure no matter whether   if you're 15 years old or you're 85   years old   if i'm ever in a restaurant and there's   you know an elderly person just sitting   there i almost want to   walk up and go put my arms around and be   like   i can't imagine what you've seen in your   life to get to 85   90 years old and i think no matter what   age you are   challenges and struggles in life they're   gonna happen it's just a part of the   journey   and i think you just really have to   trust that this is a part of your   journey   and this is what god had in store for   you   and never never forget the people you   lose along the way and always   cherish the memories and yeah cherish   the pictures and   yeah and like i said it's not easy i   mean i was even   this morning my wife had already left   but i was in her side of the closet and   she had   our wedding picture and you know there's   my sister and her husband   and they're both gone and i just sat   there and looked at that wedding picture   and i was like   wow i mean it's frustrating that they're   not here but   you just have to take a little pause and   keep their memory alive and   i tell people you know if you lose   somebody   you're never back to a hundred percent   you don't expect it   there'll always be a void and a hole in   your heart   but just try your best to stay positive   through all the challenges   well that's so good thank you for   sharing that i know   um even people sitting in this room with   my team listening it's   you know inspiring us and hitting us so   you know everybody's thinking of their   person and so   you being willing to share your story   you know you said if it helps one i know   it's helping   so many people but i know you'd still   share it if it was just one   and so thank you for just uh sharing   from such a vulnerable place and   i know people are struggling and people   are going through those hard things but   to know that there's   hope in the sense that that you just   have to trust that that   that was god's plan that god has   something good and that he   is still good and to keep moving forward   not moving on because you're never gonna   move on from moving forward in life with   it and taking   even like you've taken your nieces and   nephews and making something positive   out of it is just beautiful   and so i just i thank you so much luke   like this   talk has been so good and i know it's   gonna help so many people and i was just   thinking about that song build me a   daddy like so many people out there need   like a fatherly voice or wisdom   and the things that you just shared i   feel like it's just like from a father   to everyone like good advice   and like so much love like a hug from a   dad and so   luke seriously thank you not we always   don't get to see this side of you i love   your hilariousness and your   uh all the music and all the pranks and   everything but thank you for just going   there with us today   i really appreciate it   well you're welcome and listen thank you   for all you do for so many young people   out there   and all the um inspirational stuff you   do   and it's fun knowing you when you were   you know just a   young girl and now to see you blossom   into such a wonderful woman doing so   many great things it's really really   amazing and   don't stop the fight oh i appreciate it   thank you   those words mean so much thank you so   much luke seriously   you're welcome babe thank you thank you              all right christian everybody for some   good and bad advice i'm ready for some   good   bad advice all right let's go here on   the world let's go podcast   instagram we have some good invite   advice sent to us what do you think   about this   if you didn't make the mess don't clean   it up   bad advice bad yeah bad yeah we want   helpers we need helpers in this   yeah did your mom ever sing to you uh   clean up   clean up everybody everywhere   videos for that song you know you   learned the more articular version i   guess you share   what did you learn clean up clean up   everybody clean up   maybe that was for the less educated   kids   maybe your mom forgot the words maybe   she did maybe you forgot maybe i forgot   him but   the point is everybody clean up   everybody   that's so true yeah that's a much better   lyrics   the point is the same clean up   okay i like it we got to a good place um   all right next question victory or not   really a question statement victory is   always possible for the person who   refuses to stop   fighting yeah the underdog but is it   really always possible for the person   that refuses   possible it's not always possible i   would say i mean obviously   victory in christ like you can always   come up victorious yeah   if you're still fighting you're in like   a hard place but i mean practically   speaking that there are some things that   are worth fighting for and they're and   like marriage obviously and then there   are some things like   dating relationships aren't healthy for   you that you just actually don't need to   keep fighting   for if it's not right yeah that's not   true and i think like you know i think a   lot of times our culture tells you know   don't ever give up   but sometimes there is wisdom in giving   up you know if   if the outcome doesn't look promising or   right or what   we're not even giving up but just   shifting just shifting yeah pivoting we   talked about that on last week's episode   seems like the word of the year is the   word of the year just pivot   um all right just   pivot here's something   you can all right christian   last thing i want to run by you keep   your face   always towards the sunshine always   always   jesus is like 10 songs you could have   done for   that song the sunshine i'm walking on   sets   but no i mean i think i think you know   jesus says that you know we   we are to be bright lights and i think   that you know if we're facing him then   you know we're radiant there's the verse   that says um   you know we're radiant and i think it's   that idea of always   why you laughing that's some wisdom no   it's the straight wizard it's just funny   because   i knew you were trying to the university   that's the verse it says   you're right i can't remember the verse   but it's something about radiance and   the sun   um we can y'all should go look it up   but no it's true i mean i think that   that um i mean if we keep our gaze fixed   on christ then we are going to be bright   lights and that's what he calls us to be   that's good actually was straight wisdom   and he was i think it was   whenever it talks about how moses went   and met with the father yeah   and he came back and his face was   radiated had been like meeting with the   father and so like we do want to keep   our faith in the sun we want to keep our   face towards the father and hopefully   the light that we um are seeking is now   shining off of us   and through us yes that was but it's   just funny because i know you so well   and i think like people will put a lot   of pressure on them so like how do they   know like the whole bible verse   it's always just funny to be like   totally somebody's like   okay verses on radiance in the bible   type into google but   also use wisdom because and now it's not   necessarily smart just to go stand   outside in the sun and i'll be blinding   so useless wear sunscreen wear sunscreen   close your eyes all right kids this has   been a great   um great great about advice thanks for   sending it into the woods good podcast   hope you have fun with me and my husband   i know we did

    you   what's up fam welcome back to the world   that's good podcast y'all i   am so excited we have a treat today   we have lisa harper and y'all we're   calling her in the middle of a busy day   for her she's actually   literally in the airport on a layover   and so we're getting her   right in the midst of some craziness   there might be some sound in the   background but listen if you can hone in   on what she's saying   she has so much wisdom if you don't know   lisa harper she is the funniest woman in   the world but she's also   a theologian like she is the smartest   woman in the world she's actually a   theological scholar   she's written over 10 books well over 10   books she's a mom to her   sweet adopted daughter missy she is just   incredible she's one of my favorite   preachers and teachers   so i cannot wait i'm so glad she's given   us some of her time   in the middle of the airport it's gonna   be a great conversation so let's go   ahead and call lisa   we can just jump right in to the   question of the world that's good   podcast   what is the best piece of advice that   you've ever been given   okay i'm going to totally cheat because   i i couldn't decide between two   one is super easy and it is   eat cake first and so that's   that that's my first answer my second   answer   is from one of my favorite theologians i   usually love all the dead guys but this   guy is still   alive um his name is frederick beekner   just an amazing   writer and theologian and he said listen   to your life   see it for the fabulous mystery it is in   the boredom   and pain of it no less than in the   excitement and gladness touch   taste smell your way to the holy and   hidden heart of it because in the last   analysis   all moments are key moments and life   itself is grace   and sadie if i had to hang on to just   one   statement of apart from biblical wisdom   just one statement i've heard   it would probably be life itself is   grace   wow i think sometimes we get so caught   up   in you know hoping for the huge   breakthroughs or the massive   shifts that we miss those little   miracles that happen every year   um yesterday we were in new hampshire   and i was with my little girl she's 11.   of course i'm pathologically biased but   i think she's the most amazing kid in   the world   and and we found this like the little   kind of   spot where you could jump off rocks into   this river and it was maybe a 15-foot   jump   and we had kind of faced that same exact   type of jump   um in montana with levi and jenny lesko   and their kids we were on the float trip   a few weeks ago   and missy was scared she was really   scared we were the lust goes and after a   while with a kid you're like honey it's   no big deal   you don't have to make this jump well   here it is you know three or four weeks   later we're in new hampshire   same thing where maybe i don't know 15   feet above the water cleaning deep   enough for a jump   but she was really scared and so i was   like baby it's okay you don't have to   make this jump i said but if you want to   i'll hold your hand to go in with you   and i jumped several times it took her   like 30 minutes   and then she just she could tell she   just decided i am not going to let fear   rule me   mama we made this jump into this   freezing cold water   and to watch my little girl's face just   illuminate with   oh i did it i thought that's wow   that's enough miracle there's a carrying   me for the next week and so   i think that would be the best wisdom   i've gotten at least from someone   i don't know would be that life itself   is grace don't don't miss the small   moment moments finding for the big ones   that is beautiful i love that so much   that's so true   you know i've really noticed that   recently especially in this quarantine   just the little moments that have become   so big   you know to me recently even i told my   husband   as i was like the sunsets have just been   getting me lately and the sun rises it's   just that reminder   that like a new day is starting and yes   of course like   you know that that hits everybody but   for me it's just been hitting me extra   sweet lately and   so that's so cool that you said that um   before we get into other people's   questions   i want to ask you my own question   because you're honestly one of the most   hilarious people   ever like i mean i love listening to   yourself   i watch so many of your sermons my   friends know i send them to them as well   but you have such a great balance of   just being   so funny like your first piece of advice   eat cake first which is great   and then your second piece of advice   which is just so   deep and beautifully spoken and said um   and so how do you find that balance of   not taking yourself too seriously in   life but not taking life too seriously   yeah oh gosh that's a great question   sadie you know i think when i was your   age i was such a poser   i was really afraid um   to let kind of my crack show you know   because i just   swallowed the light that that perfection   was a prerequisite to have a   relationship with god   and so i thought oh jeez if i really you   know if i show people my real self   either they'll be disappointed or worse   still they'll be disappointed in   god and think god is less than perfect   because he has this total yahoo you know   on his team   and and he just he's so   gracious to teach us it took me a long   time to really get   that perfection or feigned perfection   is overrated and i still remember saying   i was part of a women's convert years   ago   and the head of the conference this wise   older woman   she just said it you know sometimes   people will like drop these wisdom bombs   and you're like   dang i need to like cross stitch that   that was amazing yes   but she said lisa she said women   are not impressed with what she got   right   they're impressed with where you got it   wrong and god rescued you   and i remember i was probably i don't   know maybe i was 30 and i thought oh my   goodness   jesus needs to be the hero of every   story and so   i think that kind of allows you to   exhale   and realize hey i don't need to i don't   need to present my best face to the   world i always say we don't have to wear   spanx with other people   literally and spiritually because   because of god's mercy   and so i always want him to be the hero   of the story   and so you know if that feels good kind   of laughs at myself   so be it no big deal that is so   good honestly it's so funny like you   will literally make me laugh   like so hard that i'm crying and then   you turn it into i'm actually crying   uh that's what i always tell my friends   about your speaking it's so good i love   it   when we got some great questions in from   people on   the ello sister app we got questions in   from instagram   uh people are just really needing   spiritual guidance honestly   especially in today's day not a lot of   people have you know a good   mentor or even mom or older person in   their life who can pour into them so i'm   super excited about this um   the first question someone sent in is   how do you know when god is   calling you to something or calling you   somewhere   you know there's uh there is i don't   want to ever give acrostics for really   good questions like   oh abc or one two three because i think   that's right   almost disrespectful to the question   because that's a profound question   i would say that when god is calling you   to something   god doesn't try to trip us up so he's   not trying to punk you he's   not trying to go hey hey you know   present this over here and see if   they'll fall for it   god will corroborate where he's calling   you   in my opinion through three things the   first   is his word and so if you're really in   god's word that's how we communicate   with god   and so it's not this dry textbook it's   not a collection of morality tales this   is god's living word it's living   conversation and so if you   if you have your nose and the promises   of god this love story he left us   he'll confirm it through his word he'll   confirm it through his holy spirit   if you've given your heart and your life   to jesus christ then the holy spirit   god says quickens us the holy spirit is   that whisper in your mind and heart that   says   you have the right to call the king of   all kings   abba dad and so it's through his word   through his holy spirit and then   scripture says it's through the council   of wisdom so if you've got two or three   friends especially two or three people   who are a little   further along in their walk of faith   doesn't necessarily mean they're   chronologically   older but just they've been walking with   jesus a little longer than you have   god will confirm his will through those   three things so if you've kind of got   you know if you got powerball all three   bananas come up across the screen you go   yeah   god's totally lead me in this area and   then i always think personally   that god if we're in motion   if you're taking steps it's easier for   god to direct   us because i see some people who are   like okay i'm just going to sit here on   the couch until basically like   a plane flies overhead pulling the   banner you know that tells me what i'm   supposed to do next i'm like   well maybe just take the next right step   like you don't have to be able to see   around the corner just if god is nudging   you   take the next right step and trust that   he'll   he'll eliminate the ones to call it   that's so   good oh i love that that's gonna help so   many people i feel like   in my own life i've struggled with that   too especially before i really   understood   you know what the holy spirit's job was   in life   and also that it's always going to   confirm his word those really two things   is that really i remember being a   pivotal thing in my life i think that's   so good   yeah it's like chips in queso those two   go together   oh amen don't they the best combo that's   funny   um somebody said how do i train my mind   and actions to do what christ wants me   to do and think   i think it's such a beautiful question   yeah beautiful question it really goes   back to that   knowing the voice of god um   you know when i first my little girl was   adopted i brought her home from haiti   six years ago and when i brought missy   home from haiti she was four years old   didn't speak english   and so for the first couple of months we   did charades because my creole was   abysmal   she was learning english and so she   couldn't understand what i was asking   her to do   because she couldn't speak my language   the language of god   is through spirit and word and so if you   want to be   totally in sync with jesus how god's   calling you to live   how he's calling you to change the   trajectory of your life walk into more   abundance to peace and joy   you have got to speak god's language and   so you've really got to get into his   word and i think   one of the things that's broken my heart   over the last uh let's just say the last   10 years   is you know we've got so many amazing   podcasts so many amazing preachers so   many amazing books   that i see people going yeah i don't   really need to be in the in the bible   because these people are really funny   these people are really exciting or they   do like   this awesome video stuff and it explains   the bible to me   and i'm like oh man that's like you know   that's like   not going to to hamilton   and just reading the notes of hamilton   on your phone you can't   you can't begin to understand   how much god's god loves you if you're   taking somebody else's word for it   so really i'd say first and foremost   dive into god's word   certainly use you know helps that'll   help you   understand his words some of the books   can be hard to understand   so absolutely use commentaries get get   preacher's notes   and then i'd say really spend time in   prayer   you know i do all different kinds of   prayer we live out in the venues on a   hill   and so one of my favorite prayers is to   gasp and pray   because when i walk uphill i'm in a   fluffy season and it's kind of hard for   me to get going uphill   but i walk and pray and so the more   i really am in tune with the lord   through prayer that conversation with   god i   start recognizing this voice and you the   bible says that   the bible says if you walk with jesus   you'll begin to recognize his voice and   it won't sound like anybody else's voice   it's not going to sound like your mama's   voice your boyfriend's voice your   therapist voice you'll go oh   that right there is my creator redeemer   so spend   spend time in this love story and spend   time in prayer   that's so cool i love that i love how   you call it a love story too because it   is   and i i would just say that to everybody   who even follows me and   watches me i know that a lot of you are   encouraged by things that i say but   again what she's saying this is like   nothing   compared to you yourself going and   diving into the word of god and praying   for yourself and starting that own   relationship   uh with god and a lot of you actually   ask questions about   how do i have my own relationship with   god and i think she just answered that   so for those of you who sent in that   question   um that was such a beautiful answer and   i love how you talk about your daughter   missy   you guys are the cutest pair y'all are   also light chips in case so a great   combo   um y'all are so cute i wanted to ask you   about the adoption process because my   family's   adopted and it's such a long process i   know you all had a very   long process and so any advice to people   who   maybe are walking out adoption for   themselves in that long process or just   anything where they're having to   patiently wait   um on something to happen yeah well i'd   say first of all we've got to go back to   the basics and just   remember check your own scaffolding that   our god is a good god   even when your future seems messy or   seems really blurry   our god is a redeemer ultimately   everything every single thing   will work out for our good and his glory   and i had to keep reminding myself that   sadie i   i lost two adoptions one was at the 11th   hour four days before i was supposed to   bring the baby home and i mean it   gutted me i felt like you know my heart   had been   run over by my truck and i really wasn't   sure i'd be able to   kind of peel myself up off the pavement   plus i started really   late i was i was just as   thick as a brick and i don't mean that   in like a hip kind of way   when i was in my 20s and 30s i was   really broken   dated a lot of abusive men from just   kind of got bent when i was younger   there was a lot of sexual molestation   and so those are the guys i was   drawn to in my 20s and 30s so god   protected me from them   and then the few good godly guys like   the older version of your husband   of christian that i dated god protected   them for me   because i was hot mess on a stick and so   by the time he had pulled kind of the   deepest toxic   roots out of my heart you know i was in   my early 40s   and i thought oh man i'm not going to   get to be a mom   not that god is capricious but you know   there are consequences to bad behavior   and i thought   i'm i'm not going to get to have my own   kids because my   ovaries are raisins at this point and   too long a story to share but just   it really was a miracle that god wove   adoption into my life but   after those two losses i was just like   oh   golly jeepers i'm not i'm not sure i can   kind of keep hope alive you know when   you've been   that devastated and it was just   two weeks after i lost uh   this baby but a friend called and she   said lisa   you know i know you're still really   wrecked but i just got home from haiti   and while i was there one of the young   moms in the village i was visiting died   of odes   and she left behind a two-year-old who's   really really sick she has hiv and color   and tuberculosis and   she said the doctors have told us she'll   die within a couple of months if   somebody really   anybody doesn't step in the gap for her   and she   said you know i don't know if you have   the bandwidth to even make this decision   but would you consider praying   about stepping in this process you know   another another adoption attempt   and you know it was so much messier so   much scarier than the first two   adoptions i had lost   but um i said no i said i'm not willing   to pray about it i said i've been   praying about this for 30 years   michelle signed me up and lest sadie   any any of your friends listening think   that i'm all that   i'm going to be real honest to tell you   when i hung up the phone i said a word   that's not in the bible   because i thought oh yeah i said i don't   know how to do this   how do i adopt a child that's really   sick from   haiti i mean i didn't know beginning   kind of goes back to that question of   how do we walk out   god's will one step at a time you just   take   the next step i had no idea it would be   this   you know two-year really tumultuous   process that missy would get really sick   that we'd be afraid we'd   lose her a few times but i'm telling you   two years   almost to the day i started the process   i brought her home easter week   2014 and she is   jesus is my hope but i'm telling you   missy   is this tangible miracle wow every time   i look at my kid she's healthy as a   horse   you know i'm convinced we look alike   even though she's from haiti although i   can promise you we don't dance alike my   kid has a lot more   a lot more rhythm than me but but what   god   has for us is so worth   staying the course for and i'm sure in   light of the last five months you've got   people listening who   you know you just feel like i'm a fit   into my robe and maybe even at this   point of thinking   god doesn't see me or has forgotten   about me   and i've i've been there   but i can tell you as a 57 year old   woman   i can look back over my life and say i   promised you there's not been   one chapter that i can look back now on   and say god's absence that i experienced   as abstinence i've never experienced his   absence   i've experienced doubt and i experienced   my own frail faith but god has always   been kind he's always redeemed you know   the biggest messes in my life   that i thought there's just no stinking   way this is too tangled or this is too   painful   there's always been redemption on the   other side so i would just say stay the   course   just keep walking toward jesus that's   beautiful   thank you for sharing that that's gonna   i feel like that's just gonna rain true   for so many   people and set so many people free in   this moment so if you're listening right   now   you know take it personal let the words   that she's saying   speak to you you know the reason i call   these people who   are friends of mine have amazing wisdom   is for you it's for you to   receive that advice and oftentimes more   than not   i'm actually hugely impacted by every   word   that you say as well so take it personal   um you kind of just talked about this   but i thought this question was really   good and it came from such a raw place   in someone's life   but they said how do i stop regretting   things that happen in my past   and just move on and begin to learn from   those experiences   well i'm going to borrow from the book   of christine kane who is one of my best   friends and i know you love chris as   well too sadie i   remember um gosh i don't know maybe 10   years ago   um chris and i were to conference   together and she stood up   and she took we have some similar past   as far as molestation   molestation and abuse and just some hard   stuff but she   stood up and she just really simply said   i was sexually abused   for 12 years and i'm now 52. so she said   i have not been being abused   for 40 years and she said you know   whenever   what god has done for you becomes bigger   in your heart and mind and what was done   to you then you'll really start walking   to peace and abundance   um you know that doesn't mean we we   pretend things that didn't hurt you know   over and over and over again in the   gospels   jesus compelled people to admit they   hurt   he compelled people to go i can't make   it by myself   so i think that confession of this hurts   or i'm dying here   that is incumbent upon us as humans to   go   gosh i can't fix the same hole in my   heart or i can't heal this bruise   but when you confess that trust that   jesus will redeem it   and and ultimately when you get to the   other side of that sorrow you'll go   wow i've actually been walking in peace   longer than i was walking in pain but   again there's there's so much to be said   for just you put your head down   and you keep putting one foot in front   of the front of the other and everything   you do comes from that core belief that   god is good even when life is just   cruddy   god is good that's so good oh that's so   great i love that   i actually just recently was talking to   lisa turkers   and she said the same thing she was   talking about how like you have to just   have it as a banner that god is good   like   go into things with the idea that god is   good come out of things with the idea   that god is good even when life gets so   bad   so that's so cool yeah i was gonna say   sometimes i think it helps to even do   tangible things i'm not the   the sharpest tool in the show and so   sometimes you know   you know sometimes you have to remind   your heart i feel like my heart lags   behind my head i can read all this greek   study stuff in school and read these   books with multisyllabic theological   terms   but it's like sometimes my heart needs   to be reminded and so i work with   girls in nashville who are in recovery   from drug and alcohol abuse a lot of   girls who are in addiction   recovery and i was with some girls   recently and they were just   you know talking about how hard their   life has been and you know they're   turning their lives around they're like   miss lisa do you know how little we make   like we made a whole lot more hooking   than we make   you know working minimum wages as a   hotel   attendant or chipotle and and there's   some real   hard stuff so i don't ever need to make   light of people who walk through   difficulties and a ton of your friends   do   but i said y'all we've got to remember   that this world is in our home   and that god's love is bigger than any   any difficulty we face so i said here's   what i want y'all to start doing   just between now and when i come back   next week i want y'all when you get your   laundry out of the dryer to start   putting your laundry on your beds   close the door when you have just a   second to yourself leaning   back into that warm laundry and just   imagine   jesus holding you and they were like oh   miss   lisa you ain't right that is they just   kind of went nuts and i was like just   take me at my word   just try it because you they're all in   this dorm they're like   people are gonna think i'm a nut but   they started doing it and they were like   oh my goodness those five or six seconds   when i   really let myself lean into that warmth   and imagine jesus embracing me they said   it really   began to change kind of settle my spirit   my favorite verse sadie probably in all   of scripture but certainly in the old   testament   is this one simple verse in the song of   solomon   and you know most people think that's   like this hyper lusty   you know wild x-rated poetry in the   bible but it's it's actually about the   kind of   intimacy we can have with jesus there is   of course an application for marriage   but   since i'm single i'm 57 i can't talk   about getting jiggy with it i just have   to talk about jesus   you know the bigger application is us   and and our divine husband our divine   bridegroom   but there's this scene in that story   where god   says to us his bride with one   glance of your eyes you captured my   heart   so you stop and think of that when you   looked at christian   and y'all were exchanging vows and you   probably the whole world could have   disappeared   and you would have felt absolutely   secure in that moment because your   securities   love that god is saying that's your only   human context   of that kind of love he's saying my love   for you is even   better than that and i think so many   people even   christians walk through this life   assuming god   is like a unibrow librarian mad at them   and in reality he's a bridegroom looking   at   us with such pure perfect love going   if you can only get you had me at hello   and i think when we begin to model our   lives   after the affection of god instead of   thinking god is mad at us   that kind of even changes the motives of   our heart definitely changes our   security   it's great oh it's so good thank you for   sharing that that's beautiful   um the last question that i asked and i   think this one   is really good um and it clearly comes   from a struggle that they're going   through and   actually so many people sent in this   question   um this is how do i deal with a family   member who isn't a believer   i've been there i was there for years   and years my   stepfather was not only not a believer   he was a vehement agnostic   really hated anything to do with with   god   um i was a senior in high school he   threw my bible out of the front   door in a rainstorm because he said he   didn't want that bs in his house anymore   and it was   um a loved one that desperately wanted   him to love me   and so i know um how incredibly painful   that can be especially if it's ongoing   what helped me my stepdad came to christ   eight weeks before he died   it was just i'm still convinced angels   just fell out when dad walked in glory   like   no seeking way   but um you know in the beginning of   genesis   it says that every human being is made   in god's image   the latin concept is imago day that   means   anybody even the cruelest people we see   even people who don't acknowledge   god they still bare his thumbprint   and back in probably my 30s i started   asking god help me see   your reflection and my step-dad because   he was   he was just um he didn't love me well   it was a it was a difficult relationship   and i thought if   i'm basing my love on his deservedness   or lack thereof   i'm just i'm not gonna love him well i   don't have that in me but if i can begin   to   see god's thumbprint and i begin to see   that this man is absolutely adored   by the creator of the universe the god   that i bow my knee before   then god will grow my respect god will   allow me to   answer his unkind questions with   kindness and i   it changed the way i'm not saying i did   it well goodness   sometimes i was such a brat but it   changed the posture of my heart   toward my dad and i could begin to treat   him   with uh that he was a man who deserved   respect   and dignity and value because he he bore   my heavenly father's thumbprint   so i would say be careful if you're in a   relationship with somebody who's   physically abusive emotionally abusive   back back up so that god can guard your   heart and your mind   but as best you can stay engaged by   seeing that family member of that loved   one   as imago dei as someone who bears god's   image and then i'd also say   pray for them by name speak   their name out loud you know that's   something that's really   common in culture right now   and in the social justice movement is to   speak the names of people we don't want   to forget   well i would say don't let your heart   forget or become   numb to those people who are in your   family who   are difficult to deal with don't yet   know jesus speak their name   out loud in prayer and that will keep   them coming on the forefront   of your mind and heart that's great oh   that's so good i know that's going to   help   so many people listening i know so many   names are coming to hearts   all around and so take a minute pause   the podcast pray for those people that   you're thinking of right now by name   lisa you are just incredible thank you   so much   for all of your wisdom i i like to   sometimes pull out one of the best   pieces   of advice that i've received from you   and there is a quote that made me laugh   but it was so great it said i'm so   grateful for opportunities god's given   me but don't forget he often uses   donkeys and rocks too   and i just love your tie of wisdom   and humility and humor and all the   things and so thank you for   who you are and for sharing so much   advice with us today i know so many   people   are so grateful sadie missy wanted to   extend a special invitation   she loves you when i told her i got to   talk with mercedes she said please tell   her to come go for a motorcycle ride   with us   next time you're in nashville and if   your husband allows missy wants to take   you for a motorcycle ride out in the   booty   oh that would be my greatest joy and hey   he would not only allow it he would ask   if he could go on a   only ride am not going to stand next to   you in leather pants honey   that's awesome well i cannot wait for   this day to come   you're awesome   who's ready for some wtg wtb   well that's good one that's right advice   sent in by the world          instagram page we are so pumped to read   some of the things that y'all asked us   also i actually want to ask you one   serious question first and i'm not i   know this is like sounds like i'm not   being serious but   um we just obviously had an interview   with lisa harper and we had dms in it   and somebody sent a dm that said how do   you   crawl out of a pit of habitual sin like   something that you just like cannot   knock and that's a really serious   question but i felt like you would be a   good one to answer that   yeah i think it kind of gets to the   point where you're so fed up with it   and it really gets to the point where   like you know you   you know that this is something that you   know only the lord can deliver you from   and it's nothing that you can kind of   come out of in your own strength and it   i know for me there was stuff i was   dealing with a few years ago and it   um you know it was like you know you'd   come out of it then you kind of get   pulled back in   and it really for me was when i was like   okay that's it no matter what i have to   do   i'm eliminating this for my life and it   um that really happened when i   was like no matter what has to happen   i'm going to   get through this the lord's going to   deliver me this is going to be   part of my testimony part of my story   and um yes i think getting to that point   where   you're like enough enough i know that   this can be difficult and i'm gonna   maybe still struggle with this but   i'm not gonna live in that yeah and i   think too like the lord   like he said like the lord still deliver   you from it it's not gonna be in your   own words but at the same time like you   can   definitely do things that um   yeah like say if you struggle with porn   like get   like don't get on the website get the   websites that you know   the canine browser all the things that   make your computer safe to where you   don't   like you can't physically click on those   things delete instagram delete snapchat   delete youtube you so we're drinking you   might not want to be going out to   parties and stuff where   drinks are all around like there are   actual things that you can do   to help yourself get out of that pit if   you struggle with   doing things whenever you're alone like   try to have friends over try to have   accountability   um turn on worship music to where like   you're just like you know   you can do stuff to get really serious   about not dealing with sin   in your life anymore paul actually says   it like this one time   um i think it was paul and wasn't it   paul who got spiritually annoyed   or is it peter i care i think it's paul   but there was a time in the bible where   there was this demon possessed woman and   like she was driving paul crazy to where   paul was just like   be healed like he got so spiritually   annoyed and just   called it out of her and she was healed   and so i think of that sometimes with   sin like sometimes we have to get so   spiritually annoyed with something that   we're like   in jesus name no more and keep speaking   that out until that thing   stops uh so that was a serious start   that wasn't uh   i was going as bad but that was a   question sent into the dm's i thought   was worth noting   that's a great question and you know   jesus does have the profound line of   saying you know if   if your eye causes you to send gouge it   out and i think that just addresses   the seriousness of sin and how it can   how it can   infest its way into your life and and he   addresses it so seriously with saying   you know deal with it eliminate it cut   it out yeah   so good all right we're gonna go on to   some not as serious things   and this says just make it to 2021 get a   better advice   um well i mean 2020 has been a difficult   year but i do think that   um you know james it talks about you   know going through trials another lord   you know brings you out of those and you   know kind of joy when you   um you know face those trials so i do   think that   this is a year of refinement nothing   that the lord's doing something   um that we would have never seen him   doing so i think that if we just wish   for   the next year or wish to be out of this   trial then i think we   we will lose some of the refinement   aspect that he's wanting to sanctify us   in   i agree i don't think you should just   wish 2020 away i mean it's here   it's clearly hard it's definitely   refining us but   i was thinking about this the other day   like we can forever hold 2020 as like   the worst year ever or we can hold it as   the year that we really got to know god   in a more   personable way and and that's not   dependent on the things turn around   that's   in the midst of the hard things in the   midst of the trials like christians say   we count it joy because there's going to   be perseverance that   we gain in that and so yeah i don't   think we should wish it away or just   make it to 2020. i hope that we can make   it to 2020 and say we're better because   of   uh 2021 because we're better for 2020   happening even though it's hard   all right live from love not for   love that's good advice yeah wtg   baby franny actually said that on the i   think that was a couple weeks ago his   podcast yeah she just said that yeah i   remember her saying that yeah   but um and even just the idea of god is   love   and um yeah we were talking earlier   about um the verse in john   15 where jesus says that um that he's   the   divine and where the branch is from   apart from him we can do nothing and   it's that idea   of if we're not connected to the source   then we're not living we're not living   in love we're not living from love   yeah so good all right lastly i think   this is so good true community shouldn't   always be easy   hmm i'll see what i think it's good yeah   it's good because i think i think that's   good too but i was just trying to   wrap my brain around yeah i think in the   sense of this   like you can have friends who it's like   easy with but you don't actually go deep   or you don't actually share within the   hard things that you're going through in   life   and just to be honest like life is hard   like like we just talked about 2020 has   been rough and like   if you don't have the friends who you   can talk about those things and that   it's messy like   it's not always going to be easy but   true community is there for those times   or even like you have to call somebody   out for something they're doing their   life for sin that they   have going on you're like hey like   you're better than that like that's not   always   easy but it's something you need to hear   and i think sometimes community is just   easy they just go to the flow but they   don't call each other to the best their   potential   and they're also not there for each   other and it's like hard times yeah that   was really good wtg   all right guys thanks so much for   sitting in good bed

excited to step into this moment i'm   honestly just excited to be in a church   building   this is like such a blessing um so i'm   pumped first i just want to pray and   then   i'm just going to step out of the way   and let let god move   god i thank you so much for this   incredible   incredible day god i thank you so much   for pastor miles   and courtney who are head of acc and   just the

in your name we   pray amen amen   how many of you know that you have like   the best pastors ever i just have to say   that first   because we got to give honor where honor   is due miles and courtney you guys are   amazing   i was honored to actually get to go to   acc for a few months with christian   we loved it here and he asked me to   preach whenever we first got here and i   said   can i just go to church here like i love   it like i just   love it and then one day one day when   it's right and this could not be   more of a right moment obviously this   year is not what we thought it would be   at all but we do know that god is still   good that god is still   real god is still alive jesus still rose   from the grave the holy spirit is still   active and alive and so i'm excited to   preach about that   the holy spirit when it's talked about   in the bible it's talked about and it's   translated to the word   rooha everybody say because i know you   all wanted to say it because when i   learned that i was like that is such a   good word   it's very cool but anyways it's   translated that and what it means   it means it's god's personal presence or   the energy   of god's presence it's the same word   that was translated for   the way that the clouds move or the way   that the trees   move so it's kind of also translated as   the energy   of the wind which is kind of cool when   you think about this series being the   fresh   wind it's literally we're talking about   the wind of god if you haven't picked   that up the wind   of the personal presence of god the holy   spirit that   ruja that personal presence and myles   has taught to us a little bit   about what the holy spirit has meant i   won't say a little bit a lot i've been   tracking with this series   and it's changed my life personally me   and christian have just been mind blown   every week so if you haven't watched the   last two weeks   go watch the last two weeks because a   lot of what i'm saying is recapping that   and then kind of going through a story   in acts 27 of where all of this kind of   plays out   but many of you you might not have known   what the holy spirit was before this   series honestly i didn't understand the   holy spirit at all until i was like 17   years old   and even then i was like what's   happening i grew up in a more   traditional church and then i went to   this summer camp   and everybody was just worshiping heart   abandon they were just   going for it and i was like what's going   on   like can we just stand here and like   maybe snap   like i was just like what's happening   but then somebody came up to me they're   like hey   just let the spirit move just let the   spirit move in your life and i didn't   even know what that meant i have no   concept for really what that meant i   knew god was awesome   i knew jesus died for our sins but i   didn't know what the holy spirit was   and in this moment i was like okay i'm   just gonna let it go i'm just gonna let   the spirit move   and i just began to weep and i just   began to feel   god's presence and it was so powerful   when worship   actually began to usher in the presence   of god for me the holy spirit is the   energy of god's presence some of you   might have been afraid of the holy   spirit because you've heard different   things   but myles has recapped it so beautifully   some of the highlights from the last   week are just wrote down it says the   holy spirit   he comes to set you free the holy spirit   he comes and gives you the presence of   god in the moment that you're in   he gives you the power of god he fills   you with that presence he enlightens you   he makes you the righteousness of god so   there's no reason to be afraid   of the holy spirit the holy spirit is   powerful myles even said   that jesus said he was like hey it's   better if i go   because who i'm sending is better y'all   that that's insane   we think about that like we want jesus   so desperately to come   in this moment especially in 2020 like   jesus just come back   just come we need you god but don't miss   that the holy spirit is here   like don't miss that the holy spirit is   inside of you and can do something   powerful   even in the midst of this year and wants   to do something powerful through you   yes we want jesus to come back but don't   forget that the holy spirit   is here with us i want to recap a verse   that miles talked about a few   i guess last week he talked about romans   8 so powerful if you haven't read   romans 8 in a while circle back because   this is where it's at   but in verse 6 of chapter 8 it says for   to set the mind on the flesh   is death but to set the mind on the   spirit   is life and peace everybody say life and   peace   isn't that something we crave right now   life and peace to set the mind on the   spirit   is life and peace but to set the mind on   the flesh   is death another translation says the   mind governed by the flesh is death but   the mind   governed by the spirit is life   so we're going to talk today a little   bit   about the two different winds there's a   wind of the world   and there's the wind of the spirit and   today i want to ask everybody this   question whether you're watching online   or even in this room   what is your mind governed by and what   wind is guiding your life is it the wind   of the world   is it the wind of the spirit and we're   going to follow acts 27 to   kind of look at paul's life and then   look at our own life and see how this   relates   in chapter 27 of acts they're on they're   setting sail   paul was a prisoner at this point if you   don't know paul a little recap paul used   to be saul   he used to be persecutor of christians   and then he had this radical life change   where jesus got a hold of his life   he had a name change to paul and paul is   just a savage for the gospel i mean he   is   absolutely amazing i mean holy spirit   what's happening i'm just kidding i've   got to stop saying that christian said   stop saying paul's a savage i'm like he   was like he was just amazing like   he did everything you know he just went   full force   and i love reading the life of paul and   at this point paul had been preaching in   jerusalem   once again thrown in prison well they   didn't find anything wrong with him so   they're like send him to rome so he's   going to rome at this point he's a   prisoner   on the boat and the wind isn't looking   too good in their favor at this point   and so paul   as a prisoner speaks up to the centurion   guards   and tells them this isn't a good idea   what you have to think he's a prisoner   so what's about to happen   kind of makes sense but i want us to   look at it and how it relates to our   life   so acts 27 we're gonna start at verse   the end of verse nine   said paul advised them saying sirs i   perceive that this voyage will be with   injury   and much loss not only of the cargo in   the ship   but also of our life so paul kind of had   this moment   and i don't know that it was the holy   spirit or that it was just wisdom   because sometimes you know we could say   this might have been the holy spirit   telling him it didn't actually say that   it could have just been wisdom knowing   hey this is not going to be good   the wind is clearly not in our favor so   paul used wisdom and maybe the spirit to   say hey i don't i don't think this is   this is a good thing to do we're   probably going to lose the ship   we're probably going to lose our cargo   and we're also probably going to lose   our life   and listen what happened so but the   centurion paid more attention to the   pilot   the owner of the ship than what paul   said and because the harbor was not   suitable to spend the winter   and the majority decided to put out to   the sea from there on the chance that   somehow they could reach phoenix a   harbor of crete   facing both southwest and southwest and   north   west and spend the winter there so they   were like okay   we hear you but you're a prisoner while   we would listen to you   listen the pilot said we need to go this   way so we're going to go this way   and i want us to look at that because i   want us to think about how the holy   spirit speaks to us sometimes   sometimes we just kind of get a nugget   of wisdom in our life we just kind of   get hey   this is probably not going to be a good   idea you probably don't actually want to   get in that relationship you probably   don't actually   want to go to that party you probably   don't actually want to take that   position   like something in you is a wisdom or a   message from god saying that   might not be a good idea but you're   looking around and everybody else seems   to be fine with it   and it doesn't really seem to be a   problem for some people and people   smarter than you are wiser   than you are saying no it's okay it's   gonna be fine we're gonna make it let's   just do it   anybody relate to that well listen to   what happens   verse 13. now when the south wind blew   gently supposing that they had obtained   their purpose they weighed anchor   and sailed a long creek close to the   shore but   soon take note but soon a tempestuous   wind called the northeaster   which literally is winds like hurricane   force it shrugged down the land   and when the ship was caught and could   not face the wind   we gave way to it and were driven along   i just want to make a note that the   world's wind   is very misleading for about one second   everything looked great they the wind   blew   gently it was fine everything was great   they even thought they obtained their   purpose they were like   whatever what was he thinking everything   is smooth sailing   and then boom all of a sudden out of   nowhere this   huge wind comes and now they're driven   by the wind of the world   the wind of the world will be very   deceiving it will come very gently it'll   be a little whisper   and then all of a sudden you will lose   full control   you see sometimes i feel like we do that   we jump on the ship   of an ungodly relationship and we still   expect smooth sailing   we jump on the ship of gossip   and we expect smooth sailing we jump on   the ship   of drinking a party and a porn of sex   and all these things and we still   expect to obtain the purpose that god   has for our life   and we're confused when all of a sudden   we're at the point where we have no   control   when we let the wind guide us it's not   going to seem bad at first   but it will be before you know it that   you don't know how to get back the wind   of the world is going to be distracting   from your purpose   but the wind of god will always be   leading you towards your purpose   it will be guiding you on the route of   your purpose so all of him   them here they're like oh my goodness   they're freaking out because now they   have no   they can't control the wind at all   they're going they have no idea where   they're going they're lost and where it   led them   was to hopelessness we read in just a   few verses that they lost   all hope of being saved they're like   we're literally not gonna make it out of   this   like we're gonna die and that is what   the wind of the world does   it leads you to the point of so much   anxiety   of so much insecurity of so much   anxiousness that you think i'm not gonna   make it   it leads you to hopelessness but i think   this is amazing   because in this moment paul stands up   and he has a word for   everybody on the boat and the reason why   i talked about how i'm not sure that it   was the holy spirit when   whenever he had this little advice to   everybody he was saying i don't think   this is a good idea because it didn't   say that   but i do want us to note that although   the holy spirit might not have said that   to him the holy spirit was with him   the whole way because i do want you to   know that you can still be guided by the   holy spirit and be   on a boat like this like paul was guided   by the spirit of god   he was fully in the presence of god he   was fully   being obedient to god and he's on the   same boat with everybody else   like you could be fully guided by the   spirit of god   fully in the presence of god fully   obedient to god and still be in 2020   and you didn't do anything wrong you're   just here   but what do we do in this time what do   we do when we end up on a boat   getting tossed by the wind when we   didn't have anything to do with that and   yes   we're not perfect so i will say we do   need to check our hearts and say god   what can i do what have i done what do i   need to repent from   but at the same time sometimes life   happens and we didn't do anything to   deserve it but we're in this moment so   what did paul   say paul stood up and he said well you   should have listened   sure listen to me totally called this   but then he goes on he humbles himself   he says yeah   now i urge you to take heart verse 22   for there will actually be no loss of   life among you   but only of the ship i do want us to   note that that paul said   you're not going to lose your life but   we are going to lose the boat   that's an important thing to think about   guys because sometimes god's gonna get   you   through something but the stuff that you   were carrying on to is not coming with   you   so he said you're gonna make it but   you're not the ship's not gonna make it   for this very night   there stood before me an angel of the   lord to whom i belong and whom i worship   and he said do not be afraid paul   do not be afraid you must stand before   caesar i want to stop here for a second   we just talked about how the wind of the   world   it led them to anxiousness that led them   to being lost it led them to being   hopeless but yet paul on the same boat   is sitting here with the angel of the   lord saying don't be afraid   paul you know the bible talks about that   god didn't give us a spirit of fear   but he gave his one a power love and a   sound mind paul is the guy that said   that   so paul sitting on the boat amidst   everybody as like god didn't give me a   spirit of fear   i want a power love and a sound mind   he's sitting here and angel said   don't be afraid i just want to encourage   you with that that when the whole world   is freaking out   when everything is going wrong it says   in um   psalms 46 it talks about how even when   the winds come even when everything   pretty much goes wrong it talks about   how when nations fall or when kingdoms   trouble   that we have to be still and know that   god is god   that's like paul right here i'm being   still i'm knowing that god is god and i   encourage you with that too when   everything's going wrong   be still and know that god is god and   he's still working he said don't be   afraid   you must stand before caesar in other   words you have a purpose here   on this boat and behold god has granted   you those who sail with you   so then he told the man take heart for i   have faith in god   it will be exactly as i have been told i   love the   faith in this moment paul's saying   yes i see what's going on right now but   my god just told me this   my god just gave me a word my god just   said i still have a purpose my god just   said i'm not done   i have to get to caesar and i believe   that it's going to be exactly as my god   told   me and so we're all going to be okay   we're all going to make it but the   ship's not going to make it   what faith does that take you know   obeying and following the voice of god   it's always going to retr   require trust and the reason it's always   going to require so much trust   is because it's normally going to   contradict the way that the wind of the   world is moving   like it's normally going to be in the   moment that everything's going wrong   that the wind's going crazy that we're   going to get a word from god or we're   going to read the word from god and   realize   actually we're going to be okay actually   there's no weapon that could be formed   against us that could prosper   like actually we're fine actually god's   spirit is gonna give us peace   it's gonna give us strength it's gonna   give us hope in the middle of this   moment and i believe it's gonna be that   because that's what my god said   so i just encourage this church like   when the whole world is being driven by   the wind   to remain driven by the wind of the   spirit within you   to say i have hope that it's going to be   exactly   what my god said no matter what else   happens on this boat   we go on and after this happened you   might think oh okay well this is   going pretty good now everybody should   be fine because an angel just showed up   and said you're gonna be okay   but no everybody's still freaking out   besides paul   and we get down a little further and yes   we are literally going through all of   acts 27   because i love this chapter and it is   life-changing   i think sometimes you know as church we   might say like oh i'm sorry i'm reading   so much scripture but i don't ever want   to apologize for reading the word of god   because it is like   it's active and alive so i want to read   this it says and fearing that we might   run on the rocks they let down four   anchors and stearns and pray for day to   come   and as the sailors were seeking to   escape from the ship they had lowered   the ship's boat into the sea   under the pretense of laying out anchors   on the boat so what they were doing   right now   is these soldiers were acting like they   were going down the back and just laying   down some anchors but they were actually   laying down lifeboats like they were   actually trying to get the rescue boats   and escape   they were tricking people but paul saw   this and paul said to centurion soldiers   unless these men stay on the ship you   cannot be saved   then the soldiers went and they cut the   ropes of the boat and listen to these   words they let   it go everybody say let it go   see these men were getting afraid   because of the crazy winds and so they   thought we're gonna get off of this boat   because   paul just said that the ship's not gonna   make it   but here's the thing i heard this one   time it changed my life the safest place   you can ever be is in the center of   god's will   safest place you can ever be in this in   the center of god's will paul said to   them   unless they stay on the ship they're not   gonna make it in other words i don't   know what's gonna happen whenever they   get out and that crazy wind   but i do know what's gonna happen if you   stay on this boat   cause god said we're gonna make it but   don't get off this boat   because this is the center of god's will   this boat has a purpose this is where   the presence of god is i would not try   to escape this boat   and i think sometimes the reason why we   don't have a fresh wind come in our life   is because we still try to use the   coping mechanisms of the wind of the   world   to heal us from whatever we're going   through   it's like this in 2020 in a year like   this   we just try to sleep through it we just   try to make it through we just try to   get   to things maybe are a little better and   then we'll deal with our anxiety we try   to escape   the wind of this moment right now   instead of letting god   heal us in the middle of this instead of   letting god raise   faith up in the middle of this moment   instead of letting us see what god could   actually do if we stay   placed where he has this you ever think   about the fact that god knew you when he   formed you and he numbered your days   i say that because he knew you were   going to be alive here   he knew you were going to be alive in   2020. the wind of the world is not   shocking to him   it doesn't surprise him he's like   literally saying yeah this wind is bad   your ship's not going to make it but i   have you   i have you in the palm of my hand i have   your day's number   i have purpose for you i don't the the   rest of the world it   this wind it can touch everything around   this boat it can even touch this boat   but it cannot touch you because my   presence is in you   so yes it can things can happen   but if he's in you he's sovereign and   that doesn't mean bad things won't   happen to you   but it means his strength will be within   you just like i said when paul's in this   moment   bad things are happening to him but he   has strength he has   peace he's not afraid he has joy because   he has hope   he knows god is there he knows god is   doing something so i encourage you   let go whatever your lifeboat is let go   of whatever you're coping   mechanism is and let the holy spirit of   god   the fresh wind of god come and do   something in you right where you're at   and just be obedient where you are   just be obedient where you are keep   going a little bit longer   and at this point you really think   nothing worse can happen but it gets   worse   again this really is so much like 20 20.   it's crazy um   now they're about to be shipwrecked but   it's crazy right before their shipwreck   there was this like last minute like   burst of hope from everybody they   actually like thought they were gonna   make it   it says now when it was day they did not   recognize the land   but they noticed a bay on a beach on   which they planned if possible to run   the ship ashore   so i just want to point this out because   at this point although everything kind   of went bad they kind of had this   turnaround point   they were like actually because what   just happened and i didn't read this   part but they all just got to eat before   they threw the car go over   they were all fed everybody was kind of   fine and then they see land and they're   like you know what i actually think   we're going to make it like this is   actually going to be great   and right when they see that they cast   the anchors and left them in the sea at   the same time loosening the ropes and   tie the rudders then hosting the for   sale to the wind   they made way to the beach so they're   like ahoy   we've made it it's not that bad we all   survived and then   boom again but striking a reef they ran   the vessel   ground the boat struck and remained   immovable and the stern was broken up   by the surf right when they thought   we're gonna make it   it's all gonna be okay they actually   were shipwrecked   they couldn't move they were absolutely   stuck and the soldier's plan was to kill   the prisoners at least any of them swim   away because remember they are   prisoners so now the soldiers are like   what do we do we're just gonna have to   kill them   but the centurion wishing to save paul   kept them from carrying out their plan   he ordered those who could swim to jump   overboard first   and make for land and the rest on planks   and pieces of the ship   i mean isn't that a crazy thing to   envision like they're shipwrecked it's   all these prisoners and they're   literally like they can't even swim   and so they're like breaking off the   ship and they're like paddling with the   ship like this is like the craziest   story ever   because like so many crazy things have   happened they're supposed to die but   notice   all of them the last verse were brought   safely to the land   just as the lord said your ship's not   gonna make it   but you're gonna make it god is so   faithful but i wanna talk to us about   this part because i think it's the   shipwreck part that i feel like so many   of us can relate to   and this is where it's gonna get really   real because some of you watching and   some of you listening   you're like okay which wind am i driven   by am i driven by the wind of the world   or am i driven by the wind of god and by   this point you should be able to kind of   tell   by the fruit of your life or the   direction that you're going do i have   purpose am i going to the purpose of god   or am i totally being distracted from   the purpose of god   if i'm on the wind of the world or when   to god or if my mind is governed by the   flesh   are governed by the spirit but at this   point i feel like there's another group   of people   who actually just feel like i don't   actually know what wind i'm driven by   because i just feel like i got the wind   knocked out of me   like i i don't actually feel anything i   don't feel any energy   like i don't feel like i'm driven by the   spirit i don't really know that i'm even   driven by the world i just feel like i   totally got the win   knocked out of me if you've never got   the wind knocked out of you you've   probably seen people get the wind   knocked out of them if you've ever   watched college football or soccer or   anything   it's that moment where somebody's like   running full speed ahead   and they normally don't see it coming   and then out of nowhere it's like   boom and you just can like see it it's   like   you know that moment you can't breathe   and life's the same way it's normally   when you're running it's when you think   you made it it's when you think you're   almost going to get there it's when   things are actually turning out good and   you don't see it coming and then   something out of nowhere   hits you sometimes it's sin sometimes   it's your own doing but sometimes you   had nothing to do with it   sometimes it's just so unfair and so   unjust it just hits you   i want to read you what it actually   looks like to get the wind knocked out   of you   it says getting the wind knocked out of   you it's called getting the wind knocked   out of you but it turns out   that it's not the air that's the problem   i thought that was really interesting   that the air is actually not the problem   the moment that you get the wind night   daddy it feels like it's the problem i   feel like i can't get air right now but   it's actually not the problem   it's your diaphragm that's the problem   the diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle   under your lungs when you inhale the   diaphragm pulls down to help the air   into the lungs when you exhale the   diaphragm pushes to help the air out of   your lungs so   it's not the air that's the problem why   do i say that and why is that hopeful to   me   because when life hits you so hard   although it   feels like you're not gonna be able to   breathe again   the air is not the problem the inside of   you is the problem   the holy spirit is still there the holy   spirit is still available   the holy spirit is still there the   minute that you ask him into   your life and into your heart the minute   you ask him to govern   your heart it's the inside of you that   needs to be healed   i remember a time that i felt like i got   the wind knocked out of me because   here's the thing about getting the wind   knocked out of you   you might have faced this before and i   kind of talked about this with live   there are moments   that you physically feel the wind get   knocked out of you when nobody really   touched you   when nobody pushed you when you didn't   get just completely just sacked it's   just like somebody   said something so hurtful that you   literally had the same feeling that   i don't feel like i can breathe personal   story of mine i haven't really shared   this with   people but um i was thinking i was like   god when is the time that i felt the   wind get knocked out of me this was the   first thing that popped up when i   genuinely felt like i   can't breathe and i don't really know   what tomorrow's gonna look like   and that might sound dramatic but if   you've ever been in this moment you know   exactly the thought you know exactly the   feeling   i had actually been set up with this guy   and   he was like the nice guy he was the guy   everybody loved he was a church kid   everybody was like you should totally go   on a date with him um he knows the bible   so well he wants to be a preacher   it's funny how people want to set you up   like that miles is a good set up person   but   but this one this one was not a good   setup all right everybody had high   expectation   so i go on this date and you know   honestly she's expecting great things   and i i just thought it was going to be   great smooth sailing you know i did not   see anything coming   i didn't really feel like i needed to   have any kind of like boundary talk with   him because he's the church guy he loves   bible he wants to be a pastor it'll be   great   so we go on this date and we get back   and and then he starts kissing me   and then he starts touching me very   inappropriately and i get really   uncomfortable and   it really shocked me i kind of just   remember just being frozen in time   and i don't know if that's ever happened   to you and the reason i'm sharing that   even though it's super personal is   because i've talked to other people   and there's too many girls this has   happened to to not say this   to not help people who are still in that   frozen moment   and i pushed him away and i said no   and he looked at me and he smirked and   he laughed and he said   hey listen there are plenty of other   fish in the sea   and then he left and   i cannot lie to you it felt like the   wind   got knocked out of me i felt so   belittled   i felt so ugly i felt so   devalued and i went inside my roommates   were there i just cried i couldn't even   talk   then i said i just laid on the couch   didn't do anything and i'm not that   person   i'm like wake up what we doing but i   couldn't move like   i was just knocked out because i didn't   expect it   it came out of nowhere and honestly i   was really bitter towards him   you know sin will knock the wind out of   you but something else that will keep   the wind knocked out of you is   unforgiveness   and i want to talk to y'all about that   because we need a fresh wind   we really do we need individuals to have   a fresh win   and we need a world fresh win but if you   want a fresh win one you got to look at   the wind of your life and you got to get   the sin out of your life you got to stop   jumping on the ships   that you know are going to lead you   astray but two you gotta forgive the   people who did things to you   that were totally unfair and totally   unjust that   you gotta forgive them and it's so hard   and it's so painful but it's actually   required it's actually something that   jesus instructs that we have to forgive   people so that we can love people   we have to forgive people so that we can   move on   i want to read y'all something i think   is really really crazy it's actually   the story the science behind the   crucifixion   it says this it says normally to breathe   in the diaphragm the large muscle that   separates the chest cavity from the   abdominal cavity must move down   yes we did just read this when we talked   about the wind getting knocked out of   you   it's weird how similar this is this   enlarges the chest cavity   and air automatically moves into the   lungs to exhale the diaphragm raises up   which compresses the air   we just talked about this this is the   science behind the crucifixion   then it says as jesus hangs on the cross   the weight of his body pulled down on   the diaphragm   and the air moved into his lungs and it   just remained there   the weight do you understand that the   weight that jesus was carrying was the   weight of our sin   so who knocked the wind out of jesus in   this moment   we did it's arson   somebody else's sin might have knocked   the wind out of you it's weighty it   hurts it   feels hard to breathe but in this moment   it remained there and jesus must   push up on the nails in his feet causing   him more pain in order to exhale   in order to speak air must pass through   the vocal cords during exhalation   the gospel notes that jesus spoke seven   times on the cross   so seven times jesus had to inhale and   push up on his else just so his   diaphragm   would be able to get the air in to say   the words that he was going to say   and you know the words that jesus said   he said forgive them for they know not   what they do   it is painful to forgive   it is painful to carry sin it is   weighty it hurts it literally compresses   the air from you but you know what   it also says about getting the wind   knocked out of you although it is so   scary it's actually not life-threatening   why is it not life-threatening when you   see a moment like that when somebody   gets sacked when somebody   is in that kind of pain because it's not   the air that goes anywhere it's the   inside of you   that needs to heal jesus himself   it didn't knock life out of him boy for   three days   but then the power of the presence of   god the spirit of god   filled his body and revived him back to   life   the wind of god brought him back to life   and in romans 8 it says the same spirit   that brought   jesus back to life that raised jesus   from the dead   is a spirit living in you   so the same spirit that brought air into   his lungs that revived him to be able to   breathe again walk in in wholeness   and fullness yes he's the son of god but   you were his child   is also offered to you to revive you   what does revive mean it brings it means   to give you new life   to give you a fresh win to give you a   breath of air some of you   need that today there are people today   who have   recognized you know what i am following   the wind of god i am moved by the spirit   of god   and i encourage you to keep going with   it stand firm in your faith   follow paul's instruction don't be   afraid keep doing that there are others   of you who are saying you know what i am   totally driven by the wind of the world   i am tossed left and right i have lost   control of my life   i am led in every different direction   because i keep jumping on the wrong boat   the wrong ship i keep thinking it's   gonna be fine but i am ready to jump on   the way the truth and the life of jesus   christ   maybe that's you today or maybe you're   the one that was completely knocked to   the ground and you've been on the ground   you've been struggling with depression   you've been struggling with so much   anxiety   you've been struggling with guilt and   shame and all these things and maybe   some of it was not even anything you did   but something somebody did to you   unjustly   today i want to ask you to forgive that   person let the spirit of god come in you   to forgive that person let the spirit of   god come in you to turn and repent from   your sin   and turn towards jesus why am i saying   all this my passion all this because if   we truly want a fresh win   all of these things we have to   understand there's action behind some of   these things   there's repentance involved there's   forgiveness that's involved   there's love there's purpose there's all   of these amazing things   and i do believe what my god says is   true   i do believe everything in this word is   true and how it is said it will be done   and so i do believe that yes we're in a   hard year yes things are crazy but god   is still moving and god has purpose   each one of us in this room and everyone   watching in line to be here   how do i know that well my good guess is   that you're watching   is that your breathing is that you have   life and that is not a shock to god          so i'm going to pray over you today and   no matter what category you fit in i   just ask that you would   bow your head and close your eyes          if you've never let the spirit of god   come in your life and i'm gonna say to   you what my friend said to me   so you just let it happen let go   of the things that have held you back   right now in this moment you might need   to repent for some of the things that   you've walked through   repent just means to turn god i have   done this i have struggled with this i   have walked this but god right now i   turn   from that and i turn to you god i want   nothing to do with that make me new god   maybe some of you you're sitting there   and you're in tears because the wind has   been knocked out of you invite   a fresh breath remember it is not the   holy spirit   that is just you've gone so far that he   can't fill you know is the inside of you   ask him to heal you let him come   in you and heal you and revive you   your life is worth the living   your life is worth the living   let a fresh wind come and turn   everything around   the future that you have does not have   to be determined by the past that you've   lived   god i thank you so much for what you're   doing here   at auburn but i thank you what you're   doing globally   i thank you for what you're doing in the   kingdom god   lord i pray that your kingdom would come   on earth with a fresh wind   i pray that you would revive souls you   would revive spirits you would revive   hearts god i pray that you walk with   people in this moment   through the unforgiveness that they have   that they would take that   breath in no matter how painful it is   and that breath out of your spirit   i pray that you walk with people who are   just repenting of sin and god you clothe   them   with your righteousness and tell them   that they are your beloved   that they are your child and they are   welcome in this home   god i pray that you do something   supernaturally in the next few months   before this year ends god   i don't want to look back and say 2020   was the worst i want to say 2020 is when   god   moved the most 2020 was when god   became the most evident to every nation   every drive every tongue   because it's when we so desperately   needed him   god i pray that you would bring life   you would bring restoration you would   bring hope you would bring   freedom you would set the captives free   i know that's what your spirit comes to   do i know that's who you   are i know that's what you can do i know   that's what you're able to do god but   even if it doesn't happen now   we trust that it will happen because we   know you're good   father i thank you for this time   would we not say amen and go back to our   everyday life   would we continue in this prayer   continue in this asking of the spirit   and move with urgency to revive hearts   of others   god we love you and we praise your holy   name i thank you so much   for resurrection life and the power that   you had just released on so many people   i believe you set so many people free   today god   it's in your name we pray amen   what's up what's good fam y'all today we   have a   very special treat this man has written   so many books in fact i'm literally   gonna read this because this sounds   like it's not legit but it is legit over   140 million books   in print in over 54 languages this man   has so much wisdom   it has gone across the world you've   probably read one of his books   we are interviewing today max lecato   it's gonna be such a good conversation   on his new book   you are never alone and i just cannot   wait to dive into the wisdom that he has   let's call max   so we can just jump right in to the   question of the world that's a good   podcast   max what is the best piece of advice   that you've ever been given   oh well thanks for letting me on the   program   and way to start with a hard question i   know right   years ago a gentleman said max live by   this   succeed at home first   succeed at home first in his suggestion   in his wisdom he was saying that if   you're gonna fail anywhere don't fail   with your family   and that really worked for me it   connected with me because you know i've   been a pastor all my adult life and   there are many many   pulls and tugs on the time and the   calendar and the   energy but my wife and i said okay we're   going to try to do this we're going to   if we're going to fail anywhere we don't   want to fail at home so we're closing in   on 40 years   and she's still putting up with me oh   that's awesome   that's such good advice i'm honestly   gonna put that one in my back pocket   i just got married almost a year ago and   you know my husband and i do ministry   together   and so that's such a good one for us to   hold on to too because   we want to be saying that 40 years down   the road and so   that's so good i love that advice so you   have written a new book you've written   so many books and this is your newest   one it's actually kind of funny   last night i came over to my parents   house and my little brother is   leaving for college and i went up to his   room and actually in his room he had one   of your books by his nightstand so i   thought that was so cool   but you have a new book you are never   alone and what better time for this book   to come out so   first i just want to ask you with this   concept of you are never alone   how do you keep yourself reminded of   that and reminding other people   that in a time where so many people   physically have had to   be alone we've never been through a   season like this have we said   no sir we're just getting beat up you   know first the   pandemic then the economic freefall and   then the racial   tension and now the division that   happens   because of a presidential election right   but i think that what's really unique   about this season   is the isolation the imposed isolation   i just was reading emails before you and   i began talking and i   heard from a friend and she said this is   170 days   that i have not left my house wow   170 days she has some health issues that   would   cause her to be more cautious but she   has not left her house in 170 days that   is extraordinary   it's just extraordinary yeah this   isolation that we're   all going through to one degree or   another whether it's just wearing a mask   or staying home it can take its toll   on us cnn released a study   just about two or three months ago that   said   loneliness is has the same physical   impact   of smoking a pack of cigarettes a day   wow   it just takes its toll on us our systems   our immune system   struggles because there's something that   is activated   through healthy relationships that's not   happening for many people   well so this book as you know sadie   writing books   this was written way pre-pandemic that's   crazy i did have the opportunity to   review it one final time   as it was going to press last march when   we were already   in isolation and so i was able to add a   few paragraphs   but i think the lord saw what we were   going to need   during this season yeah and place this   message on my heart so that we would   have it now   wow that is so cool if you read this   book you would have thought you wrote it   during this time because it is such   god's timing for us to get a book like   this   i love how you talk about john's gospel   and you really drew a lot from that   i think it's so powerful you know   especially in times like this when we   can have a book from somebody so wise   who just pulls out scripture so what was   it about   john's gospel that drew you there that's   a great question john's gospel is unique   it was the fourth one to be written   and odds are really good that he had   read matthew mark and luke he knew the   accounts   but he wanted to come at the story of   christ from another angle   and he tells us at the end of the gospel   he says i have written these things   that you may believe and in believing   have life in his name so he wrote a book   based on one objective what stories can   i relate   what teachings can i relate that will   help people believe   in christ in a way that they will have   life   life not just a mental acknowledgement   but really a relationship with christ   that is so   deep and profound that it brings life   it brings life that's why i call this   book you're never alone   because there is a possibility there is   an invitation   there is an opportunity for us to all   have a relationship with christ   that is sufficient that is deep and that   is profound   so that we really we're not alone we   believe that everywhere we go   we have the presence and the power of   god to help us and to heal us   and so that's why i get really excited   talking about john's gospel   because he tells us why he wrote it he   also has that great comment at the end   that   if i were to collect all the things that   had happened in jesus there's   no library would be big enough to   contain them all   it's a great statement and i don't think   it's hyperbole i mean if he was able to   interview every person jesus healed   every person jesus helped every person   jesus taught   i mean there's no way you could put all   that in the book yep so he had to   self-edit   he had to edit out stories and he picked   these he picked these miracles   because he felt they would be the ones   that would help us   believe that's amazing it's so powerful   john's always been one of my   favorite gospels too and so that's so   cool even some of the things you said   i didn't know about john's gospel and so   and i love how   passionate you get about it because it's   life-changing it really is and   these words are truly going to change   people's life when they have that   revelation that they never have to be   alone   i love when you talk about the storm in   john chapter 6 and verse 20 you talk   about how it's actually translated to   i am don't be afraid and i wanted to   talk to you about that what kind of   peace and comfort should those words i   am bring us because i know those words   god says to moses too he says i am   the i am and what is that really what   does that really mean   yeah this is the name of god this is if   if god ever had a business card   it would say i am. i am and that's what   god said to moses   when moses was hesitant through the   burning bush god said to moses tell them   i am sent you tell them i am   sent you uh we think it's probably a   hybrid of two hebrew verbs   that mean i am and i always will be   these two verbs come together and it   creates this   i am i can't get by with that neither   can you   you know i i need a qualifier if you say   how are you doing i can't say   i am yeah and get by you you need me to   say well i am fine   or i'm sad or i'm tired and that's   because we   change all the time right but one of the   messages that comes through the name of   god is that he never changes   wow he's the only one who said i am who   i am i got by with it because he doesn't   change   wow he's steady your failures don't   discourage him   your struggles don't overwhelm him yeah   and so when jesus   appeared in the middle of the storm he   said i   am fear not i am he just gave his name   he just gave his name fear not i am so   good   because his name his presence his   presence was enough   to calm the storm that is so cool and   all of us go through stormy times   what we need to know is that the great i   am is here with us to help us face our   storms   yep amen that's so good that is so   powerful   you brought up failures and how our   failures don't scare god you talk about   this in the book how   failures in life they happen and how in   the bible the bible's full of failures   you even joke that   we name our kids after these people who   have these failures   because that's just part of life is   there anyone in the bible   that you know maybe had messed up in   some way or a failure   in a sense that god used that you've   related to that's kind of brought you   hope throughout your life   what a great question that is this book   discusses the miracles   of jesus in the gospel of john if i were   to say   one miracle that i appreciate the most   profoundly   i think it would be the appearance of   christ to the disciples after the   resurrection   on the shoreline of the sea of galilee   because   each of them had abandoned christ   and peter had specifically denied christ   three times he he said i don't even know   the man i don't know   and so after the resurrection jesus   knew where they were they were on the   sea of galilee   and they were fishing and they had   fished all night they had not caught a   thing   and they heard a voice from the shore   telling them to throw the net on the   other side   and they did and they caught so many   fish they they couldn't even get them in   the boat the boat began to sink   john recognized who that person was and   he declared it is the lord   and peter peter could barely get his   britches on   before he jumped in the water and he   swam to the shore   and what was jesus doing he was cooking   breakfast   it's just here jesus has just defeated   just defeated hell just disarmed   satan just once and for all presented   himself as the only ruler for   all of history and what does he do well   he builds a fire and he cooks some fish   for his friends awesome   it's just the most tender moment peter   knowing   that the last time he saw christ   was when he was denying christ knew that   he was deserving of a good finger   pointing and tongue lashing   but jesus didn't do that the   conversation is   tender and powerful which he says do you   love me do you really love me   and three times peter is given the   opportunity to say that he does love the   lord   one time for each of the denials it to   me it's a miracle   that i can really relate to sadie   because i stumbled so much in my life   i fumbled so often i've been a hypocrite   i was a drunk you know all my teenage   years   i've not been respectful of women   through my lifetime   i was such a mess that by the time i was   20 years old   i really didn't think god would have a   place for a person like me   well it wasn't hard for me to believe   that jesus rose from the dead   i just didn't believe jesus could   forgive a scoundrel like me i'd been   given so much   raised in such a good home but i messed   it all up   wow but you know the day i decided to   trust the grace of christ and believe in   him   was the greatest day of my life and he's   been good to me   and i believe he's invited me to   breakfast every day wow   and he hears my confessions and he   forgives my sins   and that's a miracle that's amazing that   is a miracle   wow that's so powerful thanks for   sharing that that's always been one of   my favorite stories too when jesus sat   with peter at breakfast   and asked him that question do you love   me three times and   i always thought that was so crazy that   jesus was asking peter if   you know he loved him because for me i   think i always am   playing the opposite i'm like god do you   still love me because i messed up   but god of course still loves me like   i'm not i don't have to ask that   question he asked me that question and   i'm like   yes i love you god and so that's always   stuck out to me it's such a powerful   thing i love how like   so many people can read that and it   sticks out to them because of   who god has been in their story and in   their life and how the spirit has worked   in them   so powerful and it's like jesus is   reinstating peter   you know peter had fallen away but now   he comes back and he reinstates him   it's great three times he says do you   love me and then three times he says now   feed my sheep   feed my sheep feed my sheep so those   three   words of affirmation three words of   installation installing him to be the   the first preacher you know on the day   of pentecost that peter would   would preach with such power the gospel   and i think it is because he had   experienced   the gospel himself yep oh that's so cool   so you talked about believing in that   jesus died on the cross and   rose from the grave and you talk about   the miracle of the crucifixion   in the book too and the weight of that   as people read this book and are   reminded   of that miracle what do you hope   people realize about the miracle of the   cross hmm   boy you ask such great questions thank   you when jesus   in john's gospel when he's on the cross   and he cries out actually as in   matthew's gospel he cries out   my god my god why have you forsaken me   and then in john's gospel he cries out   it is finished   it is finished so there's something in   those two statements that i think   carries us into the meaning of what was   happening on the cross   that when christ cried out my god my god   why have you forsaken me   i believe he was doing more than just   quoting the psalm   from the old testament i believe he was   experiencing in himself   a sense of separation from god   because that's the price of sin god made   him who had no sin to be sin for us the   scripture says   so that in him we could become the   righteousness of god   so he experienced in himself that sense   of separation for my   sin for my sin but then when he cried   out   it is finished he did so using this   incredible greek phrase that literally   means it is   paid or it is consummated or it is   completed   i can almost see him pushing himself up   on the nails and   and lifting his chest so he could get   one final breath of air   and declare take the telesty in greek it   is   paid it is paid so what needed to be   done was done   what needed to be accomplished was   accomplished and the next time he opens   his mouth he says father   into your hands i commit my spirit and   so the two were reunited   wow you know sadie we all need to know   that we are sinners we have stumbled we   have   fallen but we also need to know that we   serve a god of great grace   and he is creating for himself a people   with whom he's going to reign forever   forever forever forever and he wants you   to be a part of that kingdom   he wants me to be a part of that kingdom   but that kingdom is a sinless kingdom   and it's a kingdom of justice and he   can't just pretend   that we've never sinned he has to deal   with it he has to acknowledge it   yeah and so in his justice he declares   christ to be the one to carry our sin   but in his grace   christ carries our sin for us and pays   the price that's so good   so it's a powerful turning point miracle   for sure that   is a turning point miracle for all of us   it's so powerful   i feel like that's gonna help so many   people understand what the crucifixion   meant   and what jesus and what god was doing   and so that's so powerful   you quoted something in the book that i   thought was so good you said   did someone promise you a pain-free life   well then they misspoken   and i love that you said that because i   do think people have this expectation   sometimes that if they're walking with   god then   it's supposed to be pain-free then   nothing bad's supposed to happen and i   think you know whenever we come into a   year like this when bad things just do   happen and they're out of our control   it's a tendency to just get mad at god   and so   what encouragement would you give people   who have kind of had that mindset that   it's not supposed to be this way we're   not supposed to go through this if we're   believers   yeah and i'm sorry somebody led you to   believe that because that's really   nothing   that the bible says i mean you're never   gonna find a passage in the scripture   that says once you give your life to   christ everything is going to be okay   really to a degree the opposite is true   because when you give your life to   christ satan turns his attention   on you and you can expect to be   discouraged   you can expect to be challenged you can   expect to be tested   but here's the promise jesus said in   this world you will have tribulation   but be of good cheer because i have   overcome the world   he has overcome the world so for those   of you who feel like you're in a season   of tribulation   god gets that he knew it was coming but   he's going to get you through this   he really is he's going to help you   that's so good   and so don't think that there's going to   be a pain-free life   here's what you can believe this pain   has a purpose   yeah that god is going to use this pain   use this season   to make you into a better person you   know that old saying is true   we can either be better or bitter don't   let this season of isolation and   struggle don't let 2020   turn you into a bitter resentful person   let it turn you into a better person   lean into god make this the year you   pray the most   yeah that you discover new depths of   living in relationship and harmony with   him you'll be a better person because of   it   that's so good man that's so challenging   for me too i remember having this moment   a few weeks ago we were in like a prayer   group and we were praying and i was like   just thinking about how you know 2020   can be   like it can forever be defined in our   memory as like the worst year the   hardest year but   if we begin to pray and just like seek   god in this and read more it really   could be the year that god became the   most tangibly real to us   you know that we sought him the most   that we prayed the hardest that we   read the word and took him at his word   and understood what his word meant and   you know again weren't confused by why   is all this bad stuff happening if god   is real   we understood that it's okay that those   things are happening but god's promises   are still   true and so that's so good such a   challenge for me   lastly i want to talk to you about this   really hope-filled statement that you   wrote you said faith is not   the absence of doubt faith is simply a   willingness to keep asking hard   questions   and i wanted to ask you to just give   encouragement to the people who   maybe they've been struggling with doubt   and they felt like because they doubt   then they don't have faith   maybe encourage some of those people who   are going through that time of doubt   and just overall like overall message to   those who feel alone who have struggled   with doubt in this year   to just keep the faith yeah thank you   for asking that question and   in in the book i tried to be really   upfront   about the doubts that i've had i think i   even went to say that i might be   defrocked from the ministry   if people knew how many times but i do i   have these questions   like do i really believe that god became   a   human being that god became a tiny   baby that god grew up in a map dot of a   town in   in ancient israel do i really believe   this you know   i catch myself every so often needing to   work it through again   needing to work it through again but you   know what i think that   working it through that thinking it   through   that walking down that road is good for   us   it's good for us because we come out   stronger   on the other side and i share in the   book how   when i was 22 years old i went to a   friend and a dear friend   and i said i don't think i believe   anymore this is just too radical   it's too bizarre and so his question to   me   i've never forgotten he said okay then   tell me what happened to the body of   christ what happened to the physical   body of christ   that was placed in the tomb because   everything hinges on the resurrection   if christ rose from the dead then our   hope is not in vain   if he did not rise from the dead the   converse is true   we've been duped so his question to me   was where's the body   and so he walked me through what i've   now come to see is   really apologetics 101 and that is   who moved the stone wow where did the   body of christ go   don't you know that if there really was   a cadaver of christ   the romans would have produced it   because they did not want to go down in   history   as people who could not even crucify   somebody sufficiently   don't you know that if there was a body   of christ the enemies of   christ would have produced it the day   that peter preached that famous sermon   on the day of pentecost   they could have said well come on   everybody we know where the   tomb of joseph of arimathea is we're   going to see if there's a body   in that tomb and they didn't do it   because   they knew there was no body in that wow   so if that if there was no body if there   was no   physical cadaver then that must mean   only that there really was a resurrected   lord   wow there really was a resurrected lord   and no wonder the apostles could   preach in such power because thousands   and thousands of people there in   jerusalem knew   that tomb was empty the word was out   that the word was out the word was out   that jesus had   had risen from the dead and it just   simply fell to peter to explain why   and when he connected the dots for the   people that's when the movement we call   christianity   began wow so i do have to work through   that story on occasion sadie   but every time i work it through i think   i come out stronger   but please if you're a person who has   your doubts   that's okay god never turned away a   sincere doubter   he didn't turn thomas away in the upper   room and thomas   had his doubts but he never turned   thomas away   and he won't turn you away as well wow   come on that's so good i am so   encouraged by this conversation i'm so   encouraged by your book   again you are never alone everybody go   get this book it will encourage you and   strengthen you in this time it was such   god's timing for this book to come out   and so max thank you for writing it   thank you for   pouring in to all of our listeners today   and just encouraging us i hope that you   feel   encouraged yourself well thank you it's   a great treat to talk to you   and all the very very best   thank you to you too   all right everybody we got christian in   the house in the house   there's a house in the house we need   like a we need a theme song   like corey in the house yeah yeah yeah   okay this is christian in the house   okay we'll work on that uh how do we   always start singing i think it's the   microphone that does this to us   anyways we got some good about advice   sent to us in from the whoa that's good   podcast instagram   thank you guys for sending this in all   right christian what do you think about   this   do what you love the money will follow   hmm   yeah i mean i think that's good you know   i think that if if money is your   ambition then i think   you know that's going to lead you down   some path you know i actually read this   morning that   you can't serve both god and money but i   do think that you know doing what you   love and following that passion   that if it's something that allows you   to make money then you know then that'll   happen   if you're doing what you love yeah and   sometimes you know you can do   a job for financial reasons and then   also do what you love as a side hobby   all right you need to test it before you   drive it   wait a second are you asking what i   think you're asking   i think they mean like like like a car i   don't think they mean a car   do you think it's   nice okay no bad advice if if   it's if it's with human beings bad   advice car you don't   have to test it for a job test to drive   a car as peppa phil says powerful said   this elite day to us   he was talking about jace and how jace   was talking about how he didn't have sex   before he was married and people say   how are you gonna know what to do and   jason i'm just gonna figure it out and   then he got married he has three kids   and now he says   he figured it out yes you don't have to   just have to test drive before you drive   it   but a car you should do that all right   these people want to know netflix and   chill   nope while you're single dating nope   nope nope nope this is about it   married yeah married weekend netflix and   show yeah   i still just don't like the the the   phrase netflix and chill though   when you're married if it has a bad   connotation that's true   but yeah it's the same if you are not   married   let's just put this and you netflix and   chill you might accidentally test it   this is not good those two coinciding   put yourself in that position   you can you can netflix and chill while   you're driving to test the test   test driving i feel like we're like   little kids are like live and like   turning red   all right you only get one good name   don't ruin it   that's not always true like saw de paul   yeah   jacob to was in israel   yeah jake no oh yeah well we actually do   know i got i went from jacob to jake   so my dad he went by jess and then he   went by willie so sometimes it's true   you can have a name change you can   definitely the name change you should   try to honor the name that you've been   given   yeah that's good advice yeah and that's   all for today   from the what's

this guy is hilarious he   is multi-talented uh but he is   filled with the spirit in the word of   god so welcome to the podcast   nate butler what's up   hey what up sis how you doing so good   better now i've been pumped about this   conversation little do people know   we have been trying to do this for   months but because   of covid and all the craziness of 2020   we have not been able to have this   conversation but   i think the timing is perfect because i   think ending this year   talking about some of the things we've   struggled with this year and just also   moving forward with hope for the next is   gonna be awesome   um but before we get into all of that   and they have to ask you the question of   the well that's good podcast   what is one of the best pieces of advice   that you've ever been given   wow this was given to me by a pastor   and that pastor said oh you know what   let me go ahead   and give you some context around this   so i was at   i want to say uh universal studios   and this was universal   universal studios in uh   uh la and i was on set and i had just   came back   from a long weekend of casting   on the television show before the p   diddy   dj khaled and a couple other people   and i came back and there was a like a   deal   type of thing that was offered to me at   the time for a television show   and then also there were some things   happening where i was getting a lot of   speaking engagements and stuff like that   and   i was just like oh my goodness i'm   trying to   and then i end up going um and talking   with this pastor   and this pastor was like i was like man   i just need you to pray for me   that i would find the balance in my life   and   and with all these things that i'm   juggling and then he said to me   i would like to if you wouldn't mind   can i just change your vocabulary for a   second i'm like no sure please do he   said nate i want you to take the word   balance out   he said because nothing in your life   deserves equal weight   wow yup that's what i said   and he said i would like for you to   shift that   word balance into the word priority   and then he went on to to do the   what we know and biblically seek ye   first the kingdom   of god and all his righteousness and all   these things would be added to it and   then he was like so nate you know that   should be there   family next and then he just went on and   broke it down to   he was like but if you give everything   equal weight   he was like uh every single time   you will fall and fail every single time   because nothing   deserves equal weight so right now i   live a life of   pride priority it's good   in everything that i do and even while   we're speaking on that   i i even like the the fact of when i   look at that scripture   of seek ye first the kingdom of god   and his righteousness and all these   things will be added i just   was just thinking that in a minute that   a lot of people when they hear that   scripture   immediately they think about the way   you get all these things added is   seeking you first the kingdom of god   and first of all that's the wrong heart   condition but   the big thing is that we are missing a   very important part   and people glance over that next part   it's   uh seek ye first the kingdom and   its righteousness it's good   and it's righteousness then   all these things will be added um the   kingdom of god is god's way of doing   things and in his way   of doing things there is righteous   behavior that is not earned   you know but uh that is actually given   but there still is   they still mean there's holiness and   there's sanctification there's so many   different things and   so we so all within that   is kind of just wrap something to that   what he told me   um so i'm just thankful for that so   that's   the most the best advice he's given me i   love it ella is so good so   some of you may be wondering who is this   guy because   the thing is nate you so casually say   things like yeah p   diddy dj khaled then you're like and   then this pastor and then this   and i'm like yeah that also was shocking   to me so   funny enough nate and i met um through   world vision so nate came out on tour on   the live original tour whenever   world vision was sponsoring us and he   was just the world vision rep   and uh it was so funny so my grandma too   mama if anybody's ever seen her on   instagram   two mama she's the best so she comes to   every single thing we ever do   and she was like have y'all seen nate   like have y'all   seen like his like thing we're like   who's nate she's like how do you not   know who nate   nate like he's a world vision guy he's   amazing and like   she was like fangirling over nate she   loved you and we were like who's saying   so we go we watch you one day i mean you   crushed it it wasn't just like the world   vision   pitch it was like preaching the gospel   and like you were   so funny it was so relatable you   also like have the best fashion and   we're like who is this guy   so somebody goo somebody like googled   nate and   your wikipedia is quite impressive he   like produced all these different albums   you're casting   asia all these different things but yet   what i loved about you is you were on   tour serving god through   world vision and i also know that you've   started at passion city church like   you've done so many different things for   the church   but at the same time you've also done a   lot of successful things in the world   and so   for you like what is that importance for   you to serve and to give back   whenever you know you could just be   going off and doing music and doing all   these different things what brought you   back to that like servant heart   well um i i i think   the fact that   i guess the big way is to put it i have   to take it back to   when i was first trying to start to get   into the music business   and uh it was gosh it was years ago   and everything that everything my hand   touching actually was failing   that's the best way to put it you know   it wasn't prospered you know you were   just like   you get planted by the rivers of living   water and everything your hand touches   will prosper   you know like that didn't happen for me   so i think i was by a dead stream   because like everything everything i was   touching like it just wasn't working   and i had um i was in this crazy car   accident   and where i was on my way to go sign a   record deal at the time   and um in this crazy car accident and a   car   runs the stop sign and um wraps my car   around a tree   and i walked away without a scratch and   and i'm saying that because this is   going to set up the next thing   when something like that happens to you   immediately   you just start to reevaluate life on so   many different levels and   right this god had nothing and he it was   god's grace that saved me because we   know the enemy comes to steal kill and   destroy   but what i noticed was in that moment   i was just like wait a minute what am i   actually   doing with my life well   i was like what am i actually doing i   mean i was i was born again   i love the lord but the lord that i was   worshiping was   actually uh i was worshiping the god   of hearsay from my dad and my mom   the god of like hearsay meaning i knew   what god had done for them   but i did not know what god was doing   for me   i had i didn't have a relationship with   him   so my relationship with god was being   lived out through   just my parents and my grandparents and   in that moment   i met god in a new way and   i was like you know what it's time for   me to   just kind of lay back give god   everything meaning i put down music for   like a year   and i just prayed and i fasted and   in that year i fell in love   with jesus i just i fell in love with   him   and from that moment he took this heart   of   just wanting to be on stage and take my   shirt off and be like bobby brown   and be like ladies ladies   he took he took that heart and he really   softened it and it just became soft and   pliable to where i just fell in love   with the things of god it's good and i   wanted people to   experience what i had been experiencing   and   i always go back to that place   so just having a soft and pliable heart   to where i want to do things for others   and not for me it's good i love that   it's crazy that sometimes it takes those   moments in life   that stop us long enough to think about   why we're doing what we're doing and i   mean   even though it's so hard to go through   those things like a car accident or like   anything that's   tragic that happens sometimes those are   the moments that actually end up making   us like who we are   and so it's cool to see what god did   from that moment   um speaking of another moment that i   know god has kind of   used to define a new chapter of your   life   is just your survival and your victory   over coven   i would say i want you to share your   story but it's more of a testimony when   i hear you talk about it so   you know we've talked about my covet   story on the podcast but i would love   for you to share   a little bit about what you experienced   and what god taught you in the midst of   the sickness and in the midst of the   pain and coming out of that on the other   side   um what can you look back on and say wow   god i   i'm i'm even though that was so hard i'm   glad i saw you in this way   uh i i think when we can we if we start   we talk about it   was that like so i got covet extremely   early   and i got coveted like the first the   beginning of march   uh when basically when no one knew   anything remotely about   uh the sickness the disease what   whatever you want to call it no one knew   anything about it   and so i end up getting covet   really bad really fast temperature 103.   i remember one night i was sleeping on   um i had like some concrete floors in my   house and i was sleeping on the concrete   floor in my boxers   that's how hot it's funny now right   i'm not loving it it's just knowing you   that's funny   exactly it's funny but you know but you   know it was the fresh boxes though   so um it was it was at a point though   i'm just really hot and a couple of days   later it got so bad that   um i couldn't breathe   it felt like someone had a belt and it   was tied around my chest   um pass past the last   hole and it was just tied really tight   and that's what it felt like   uh my temperature at this point is about   104   and uh my wife shout out to weary   uh we had a she had called one of our   friends who's emergency room doctor   and she called her and was like hey um   nate's experiencing this   xyz and she was like you have to get him   to the hospital right now and she told   me   exactly what to say it was these words   that i had to say to you but again to   the hospital because at that point they   really weren't letting a lot of people   in   and i remember sleeping   and just resting and she came into the   room she's like dave we have to go to   the hospital   and i remember saying to her um   i am i just need about 15 minutes of   sleep   i just need to rest but what's crazy is   is that   i knew kind of like in the back of my   mind it was so wild how   the you just believed the subtleties i   knew that if i went to sleep that i   would not wake back   up well and i was okay with it   that's the wow thing because the mental   and spiritual warfare and things that   are going on with that   and and and i i and it was crazy because   it was almost like you know you know   kind of like when   the enemy was talking to eve and was   like oh just eat that everything's going   to be okay and it was   almost like surely you won't die and and   in that moment it was like   i kind of knew and i felt the holy   spirit's like do not go to sleep   i heard nate wake up it's time to go and   she said she didn't yell she said it was   normal but it felt   it almost felt like the roaring lion was   coming out of her   and but that's what i heard and i woke   up immediately and i'm shuffling to go   to the hot   you go to the hospital and we get to the   hospital everybody   has on hazmat suits and as soon as i go   in i see an elderly man   to the left and i go back into the back   about four minutes later i see all these   doctors running and rushing   and he coded like he died   with covet that's the first thing i see   wow   go there they get all of my they get all   of my vitals down and stuff like that   and i stayed there for like five hours   and they told me to leave   so after the five hours them getting my   getting all the fluid and   inflammation down they were like okay   you gotta go and   and at that moment everything was kind   of okay   but two days later is when basically all   hell broke loose   and i say that really just because like   it was like the enemy had just tried to   release everything   up against me and it's around two days   later   2 30 a.m in the morning i am   um sleeping wake up and i   am basically just talking gibberish   and my mouth was disconnected   from my cognitive thinking so   i my brain was thinking i was having a   conversation   with myself like oh my goodness i can't   stop my mouth from talking   it just would not stop it was like it   just wouldn't stop   and now at this moment the first thing i   thought about was how many   uh people with mental illness are on the   street   they're just talking but they're aware   that they can't stop themselves from   talking   dang and this is what's happening to me   and now   i'm still able to move you know and by   this time   i really couldn't walk i found out later   that i had blood clots   um all sorts of stuff and i'm just in   the bed   and i'm just really crying out to the   lord in my head i'm just crying out to   him like lord help me lord help me   cry calling on the name of jesus like   lord you your word says that you know my   thoughts like   and i'm really just crying out to the   lord and i can't stop   i can't stop my mouth from moving and   then after that   i had about maybe five seconds of a   window and that window i was able to   to gain control over my mouth and i was   like lord please   help me and then i went back to   gibberish   and then i'm just like okay well lord   this may be it   because i'm kind of going in and out and   then i i sense   something that was in my heart saying   like i'll help you to the shower and i'm   sitting   like wait you'll help me to the shower   what   what kind of like you know i'm thinking   like   the shower you know that i'm like this   has to be a joke because i'm like   i can't even make it to the bathroom and   and honestly i don't remember getting to   the shower   but i get to the shower uh i turn the   the handle to like warm but it felt like   scalding hot water on me   turned it all the way down to cold and   i'm in the shower for 10 minutes   just water coming over me cooling me off   i gained control   over my mouth after about 10 minutes and   i'm just   weeping i'm weeping   and i'm like lord what is like what is   going on and as i'm even as i'm talking   to you now   i'm remembering this moment so clear   i went back into my room and my mother   i don't my mother was up she's like up   at 4am and   and she sent me a text message and said   nate i want you to listen   to this i was up and the lord put this   on my heart and she told me she sent me   this   song on youtube of just old time gospel   songs   of a prayer service that um from back in   the day and i turned it on   and i started worshiping and praising   the lord   and i was singing i was coughing i   couldn't breathe   but i was just in   i was i was in that room and uh   and it was in that moment i was like i   was like you know a praise is my weapon   wow and i was like uh i will live   and i will not die because up until then   i forgot who i was wow   i forgot that i was a king's kid i   forgot that i   that god had given me authority i forgot   about all of that i was just i   fear had gripped me so much   and i was just like you know what i'm   not playing with this devil   like i'm not playing with him and that's   the day i decided   that no more yeah and   i and what i realized was that   and i'm gonna go a little bit fast   forward to what i gained   on the other side because other things   as you know happened throughout that   journey   but what i gained from the other side   was this was that   when you are in a situation when people   always say when you come out of such a   hard tough situation   people always say you kind of come out   with more power or you have   a new authority and what i realize is   that   the authority is always there   you always have the authority   so when people when they say people come   out with a new authority   it's not that it was this new authority   was given it was an authority   that you never needed wow   so i never needed this the authority   that i had to tug on and grab i never   needed that   like when the children of israel and   they would go through something with god   and he would reveal himself   in a new way you know they will reveal   himself as jehovah jireh jehovah shama   you know jehovah shalom their peace they   would remember they will remember this   so   when i came out of this covet situation   i met god in a new way and i was able to   gain   authority that was already available for   me   because so i grabbed that portion and   that   you know and i took that with me the   beauty of all of it is you don't have to   give it back   hmm it's good once you get it you don't   have to give it back it's yours so now   i remember that he was   jehovah rolfe my healer i met   the healer and i don't have to give that   authority back   i've just never needed it before yeah   you know so all of that works out great   get out of covet then i get pneumonia   well   then once i get pneumonia i have a   collapsed lung   had to have emergency surgery   while awake it was horrible   and and the nurses were laughing because   i was screaming   extremely loud but you know i'm being   extra though you know   so then i'm in the hospital for a couple   of days and then i come out   and i have another collapsed lung okay   and then i go to the doctor that monday   and then the doctor's like okay   you have a collapsed lung this is crazy   and   he looks inside of my my he looks at my   cat scans and he says   not only do you have a collapsed lung   you have basically   five let's just say for the sake of this   listeners five tumors in your lung   so pneumonia collapse lung   five tumors in my lung and i have   another collapsed lung   the doctor was like we need to do two   surgeries on you but we could do them   both at the same time   well two procedures one surgery we're   going to take your lung   and we're going to attach it to the to   the chest cavity wall and then we're   going to cut out the tumors   however we cannot give you this surgery   because your lungs are so   damaged from covid and pneumonia they're   inflamed and they're scarred they're 90   flamed and 90 scarred i need the   swelling to go down at least 50   because if i open you up and do the   surgery now you'll lose your lung   27 days later i have another cat scan   three days before my surgery the   swelling has gone down and scarring has   gone down   uh 80 percent wow   so god had already done a work yeah and   then   three of the tumors were gone what   yes three days later when i went in to   do   the surgery they did the surgery they   put they attached my lung which was   that all was crazy but then when they   came out   um the doctor was like well we looked   everywhere   and we couldn't find the other two   tumors either oh my gosh   so god had removed them all from me   because they would have had to have cut   when they say section off the tumors   they would have to cut them out of my   lungs   so god really he just showed up and this   was from march 13th to july   the 3rd now there's so many course god   details that kind of happen in that that   makes it even that more juicy and stuff   but   for the sake of time that's what   happened oh my gosh   nate thank you for sharing that uh i   mean   i even know the story but even to hear   it again like   every time it makes me just emotional   and all and wonder at god and i love   what you said about the authority it's   not necessarily a new authority it's a   party that you never needed and   it's really cool because seeing you grab   onto that authority and then even   whenever i had covered and   obviously it wasn't nearly as close to   as bad as yours but   i remember like day like 10 and i was   like this is like forever   and i remember just being mentally   exhausted and physically tired and all   this stuff and i remember you called me   one morning   and you were like it's over like   no more than me does not get another day   like get up but no and   i mean it was the best and then two days   later i did i was like i'm up like   and you were like you need to start   praying out loud you need to start   worshiping your house you need to like   start fighting this battle like you said   like let your praise be your weapon and   i mean   christian and i took it so seriously   after that   and i mean mentally i started regaining   strength and then   later you know physically started   catching on to that and again   it's like i found this authority that i   had never needed before so i didn't know   how to tap into that i didn't know   how to call on for that but having you   who had   been through that and teach me that like   it helped me so much and so   i just think that's so cool and i think   that's powerful for those listening that   if you've been through something hard   and like you've found authority in god   through it like   call somebody else you see going through   it pray over them   help them like speak scripture over them   yeah like called out stuff in my life he   didn't even know was in my life uh but   it helped me like   so much and so gosh i just think that   that is so powerful   um they we we could talk so much about   i know i know i know and i i know this   this podcast a little bit heavier and a   little bit deeper   and the truth is like i am for those   listening the reason why this is going   to be deep and   we're talking about some of these   heavier things is because nate and i are   actually friends these are things we   actually talk about in life and i think   it's like   things that these are the kind of   conversations you have to have with your   friends   these are the kind of conversations you   know you can't just watch on the news   you need to call a person   that's going through it with you and   talk to you about it um so the other   thing i want to talk to you about is the   racial tension   that we face this year um and i really   wanted to bring up what happened in   atlanta   um which i haven't talked about publicly   at all but   i and i don't want to dwell on what   happened more so what happened after but   to summarize it real quickly i was in   atlanta   with um christian and we were filming a   right now media   video series for a daniel study that we   were doing   anyways i go out in the street of   atlanta i was doing this video and a car   stop   and these two guys um they were two   black men and they   got up they got they stopped the car and   they started yelling at us to put   them on camera and you know we were   videoing we kindly waved and smiled and   kind of thought they were joking and   then   i mean just in a second it just turned   super bad and   they just started yelling that they're   gonna shoot us like we   deserve because of the things that like   we've done to them this year and that   black lives matter don't we know that   and all of these different things and   they were just so angry and just yelling   and   um i mean i was really afraid honestly   i was really tearful we totally   just got cussed out threatened all this   stuff and   um i didn't know what to do and nate is   from atlanta and so   i called nate and asked him if he could   come   well my friend called nate and asked if   he can come and be with me and help me   and   just kind of work through what just   happened and so nate   and his wife to erie first of all went   through chick-fil-a   blessing and got us some dinner and   came and the stuff that you spoke over   me in that moment   like i'll never forget and i just want   to like first start by saying this to   people listening   you know it would have been really easy   in that moment to call somebody who   is just like me and could have just said   well that was so wrong of them and   that's why we have to be careful and   that's why you shouldn't go   out and that's why you know this is so   bad and   they could have just blamed them the   whole time because of how   like wrong that was but i didn't call   someone that looked like me i called   nate because   i was like nate understands this more   than i ever could and i want to   understand i don't want to be wounded by   this and hurt by this and make me   you know be fearful of um somebody who   looks different than me or make   me you know start talking negative about   someone who looks different than me just   because of one experience that i had   and nate and to erie came and first of   all prayed over us and just   shared a lot of wisdom with me and   christian and so i just wanted to talk   about some of the stuff that you shared   with me that night about stuff that you   had been through just like that on the   opposite end   and how you've come to the place in your   heart where you don't hold   some of the hurt that maybe one   individual person said to you   against a whole race of people because   that was something that really hit me   that night   yeah i think if um uh   i think the first thing one of the first   things i said was i   if i remember correctly was   are are you what are you going to do are   you going to quit did i say that right   yeah you did i think i was like you know   what what are we going to do are we   going to quit   like this is what the enemy wants let me   just go ahead and throw that out there   to anybody   right now like oh man this is so good   okay   so before i even get into that let me   just share this with you guys   the bible says we have to fight the good   fight of faith   the good fight of faith so that actually   means   that there also is a bad fight of faith   wow and i think too many of us are   engaged   in the bad fight of faith   a faith that is mixed with unforgiveness   a faith that is mixed with hatred   of faith that is mixed with all of faith   that is mixed with pride arrogance   a faith that is mixed with racism   and what ends up happening is you will   lose   that battle every time   so we must fight the good fight   of faith and with that   is i a couple of weeks maybe about   two months earlier i was on tour   and i had just come off stage um   and i don't i'm not going to get in to   like the state i was in   you know because i could totally throw   shade on this state   but that i was in this state in this   particular city   and i'm there just came off stage   literally   and my the people that were helping me   out that night   they were up in the balcony and so i had   full access to go up in the balcony you   know go up in the balcony   and i'm just kind of sitting there   watching the   watching the rest of the the evening   performance and this police officer   um comes up to me and i don't want to   say in   yeah they were off kind of like an   off-duty uh officer   but they were working at this theater   and he began to truly   like harass me and tell me that i needed   to leave   uh the balcony and that's like sir i   don't think you understand like   these guys that are here with me right   now that they're here helping me   like i'm like in charge and he was like   no you need to leave right now   and he began to get forceful and i was   like sir i don't think you understand   like i belong he said no you don't   you don't belong here you need to leave   and matter of fact i want you to leave   the building   and i was like i just left the stage   and um he began to get really forceful   with me and i'm looking at that um   and this is before everything that kind   of happened   this is like maybe about a month before   covet before i got covet   and i began to have all the feelings and   this is the first time   in that moment there was someone   now this is the kicker that did not look   like me   that actually came and stood in   the physical gap and began to   say let me explain to you officer why   you're wrong   and they really began to kind of go in   on this officer   and begin to explain to them   and really get up in their face and   there's a white girl and she was   awesome shout out to britney and she was   just i mean going in   so much so later on the the   theater they knew who this officer was   it wasn't the first complaint that   they've had about him   brittany um she really just stood   in the gap for me in that moment   and she began to truly take up for me   and and i mean the the officer   it just wasn't it just didn't turn out   too   unfortunately too good for him in that   moment however   this is the at the end of the day this   isn't the first time something like that   has happened to me that was maybe the   first time with an officer   but it's happened with me with people i   mean i've been called you know   the n-word all sorts of stuff with just   different people i've experienced over   life   however this is what i want to share   is that i leave that particular   situation   angry at a whole race of people   did i leave that situation angry with   police officers all across the united   states   no i didn't because if i had of   that would have been me fighting the bad   fight of faith   and i would have been using carnal   weapons the weapons of our warfare are   not   carnal they are mighty   through the pulling down of strongholds   and so in that moment i was like   no i will   think on things that are good just pure   and i just decided in that moment that   um that this is something was like   literally was i going to quit   was i was that going to stop was i was i   really going to stop   um in not wanting to unite the kingdom   that i was i going to stop and wanting   people to   to not not for the kingdom not to look   colorful   and diverse that's not what i wanted to   do and i just had just made up in my   mind that   i'm not gonna fight the bad fight of   faith i'm gonna fight the good fight of   faith   um i'm going to i mean i think it's   funny that   most time most time when those things   happen that people put on their   own armor and they try to fight those   situations   but the bible says put on the whole   armor of   god yeah we have to put on his   armor and the moment we step into   well blah blah blah you said you know   and there's a time for   righteous anger there is a time but you   can have righteous anger   with the but god's armor on yeah   you know so in that moment when that   happened to you   i immediately saw what god what did not   god but what the enemy was doing   i saw it it was i mean he's so like i   mean   like you like you see it like he wanted   to   actually because you and i had just come   off of doing   i don't know if it had came out yet but   just that amazing piece   on race in the kingdom yep and which   i to this day people are still talking   about it   and to know that he wants to come   against   you and me to shift our perspective   on how the kingdom on earth should look   because if you get angry at   at uh some bad apples and i get angry at   the other side   then what's going to end up happening is   that you and i   will never be able to come alongside of   each other and bridge the gap   because honestly it'll just it'll never   it'll never happen and i just kind of   saw in that moment that   he was the enemy really wanted to use   that   to get you to be fearful   to be fearful of those around you be   fearful of those of the other   of the other race and i just was like no   like no devil you're not going to do it   because again   what are we going to do are we going to   quit   we can't quit i mean the bible clearly   says do not be weary   in well-doing that means we're that   means we will   have the opportunity to get weary   yeah so doing good is not   always a walk in the park   but we have to we are mandated   to not get worried and well doing we are   it's   mandated and those things are   put in front of us to make us weary to   make us say there's no hope   to make us say that nothing's going to   change to make us say that   there's no good in those people those   types of things are always put in front   of us to make us   weary but i will not get weary in well   doing   i will press on you will press on   we will put on the whole armor of god we   will not fight in our own armor   we will fight the good fighter face like   no more   of this playing with the devil like it's   no time for that   yeah cause we just we don't have time   for that you know you know i'm going   there so   go there i love it it's so good that's   so good i think   i think this is such an important   conversation and i think it's so good   for people to hear like i said these are   the conversations   you need to be having with your friends   and not the ones that you just say oh   look at the other side they're so bad   because dot dot dot it's like hey   look we need to fight to believe for   what jesus believes in for us we need to   fight to bring heaven   to earth we need to still fight for   unity we need to fight against the fears   that we might have   um because of things that we've seen or   things that we've experienced   and so for you you might not have had an   experience like i've had and you might   not have had an experience like nate's   had   or maybe you've just watched it on the   news and you've seen it on the news and   even that the things that you've watched   have made you fearful have made you   have hate in your heart or bitterness or   judgment   towards a whole race of people and i   just encourage you check your heart   purify your heart renew your heart   because you can't   quit like nate said you can't just say   oh because i've seen this and because   i've experienced this   this means everybody from that side is   bad and i'm not going to try   to fight for unity and so nate i just   appreciate you   just fighting for kingdom and i   appreciate you   helping me in that moment because i'm   not gonna lie i was   gripped with fear and i was like i'm   never   going out on the street again and like i   mean   seriously i remember i was like i'm   never coming back to atlanta   and you're just like no sadie what are   you talking about because   the truth is that that's not that's not   really what i think that's not really   what i believe   but fear can make you say things that   aren't really aligned with the truth of   who you know you are and what you know   you believe   and so thanks for doing that for me i   wanted to finish this on   a kind of an interesting fun note so i   wanted to ask you because   you know obviously we talk about hard   things there are hard things in life   you've been through hard things i've   been through hard things but you're also   one of the most fun people i've ever met   and i like love to hang out with you   into your are so much fun you're   hilarious   so how do you balance life being hard   and not being naive to that but having   just the joy of the lord inside of you   and having fun   well you know what i just don't take   myself honestly i just don't take myself   too seriously   like i don't believe that i don't   believe the   um well sometimes i believe it but i try   not to believe the nate butlin hype   period   because you know sometimes you can you   know you can get to places to where   you know uh you you've accomplished some   things in   life and but i started realizing that   everything that i've accomplished i have   to laugh at it because if people really   knew   like you i'm like you guys don't have no   idea that i have no idea what i'm doing   you know what i mean   it's like i don't like people like well   how did you write that song like i   really don't know   like i don't i don't know how i ended up   on that show and   and i just really i don't take myself   too seriously and   and i do give a lot of um honor to god   like   seriously like he truly everywhere i've   been   he's always kind of gone before me and   then the places that i've kind of   he hasn't gone before me those are the   really things that i laugh about   because i'm like man i really i really   just like   messed up and i'm in this situation and   it's not funny when you're in it   but when you kind of get out of you're   like man that was really stupid you know   because you can't you kind of get you   kind of get ahead of god and you're kind   of he's kind of like   i'm like man god where are you he's like   man i'm over here   like what you doing over there like   i'm over there you know to me so i just   don't take myself too serious that's   kind of what it is that's good i love it   one day i love you i love to airy you   guys are   amazing thank you for uh just being   willing to share your story   on the podcast with a whole lot of   people i think it's gonna encourage   people   i think people are gonna walk in the   authority that they   are finding in god right now and i hope   that it helps people   fight to believe in other people that   might look different than them   because what what my hope is in   finishing this year   with this podcast or one of the ones   we're finishing with is that you know   we'll we'll actually learn from the   things that we had to learn from this   year that we won't just   you know say man that was tough and   hopefully 2021 will be better we'll say   that was tough and we grew stronger and   we're gonna be better in 2021.   and so i'm encouraged by you thank you   so much we love you   and um can't wait to see you next time   next time we're going to be   uh doing an event together i'm pumped i   know isn't that crazy   but you know what it's going to be   phenomenal   so it is so sis it's awesome talking to   you   oh tell tell too mama tell your mom   and tell your daddy tell your brother   tell your sisters   we          thank you so much for sending in getting   bad advice to the world let's go podcast   instagram and hello sister out we love   it all right christian you ready yep   all right let's see what you think about   this common sense is   genius dressed in its working clothes   that's the best way to describe common   sense i'm someone who really loves   common sense   that made me think for a second genius   dress in its working clothes is common   sense   yeah i'm just picturing like a common   sense   mail i just thought of another good   piece of advice is i just said that   sometimes you have to rework a sentence   for it to sound   better   period this is good advice during the   segment yeah you know   you gotta love that i really do love   common sense it's refreshing to meet   people who have comments   sometimes people who don't have common   sense i love you but sometimes they can   kind of ignore me   it's something i'm working on it's true   that is true i've   actually seen that in you we're real   that's good   we are real we're straight up we   straight up we're talking about the real   stuff   like if you're someone in the baskin   robbins line and you're 20 yards behind   the other car   scoot up that's christian's biggest   might be because   okay so i don't know if baskin robbins   is a huge thing where you're from but   where we live is the   height it used like for the first like   month and a half it was open it took   at least an hour to get to the front of   the line so christian it would drive him   crazy he won car that was like 20 yards   behind and we don't be like waiting on   the road   so yes common sense is genius dress and   working clothes we respect those for   common sense   and if that was your best problem life's   a climb but the view is great   i can almost see it that   dream i'm   great advice yeah there's even a whole   song about it   the view is always great it's the class   yeah i don't know what a microphone does   i

pre-conversation   that led me to be like we have to do   this on the podcast because it was just   so good   her advice always blows me away and i   know today   everybody's gonna be so encouraged   because we have christine kane on the   podcast   welcome christine hey sadie it's my   honor to be with you i'm so   fired up we are so fired up i can't wait   um so you know i'll start this off the   way i start off every podcast with the   question   what is the best piece of advice that   you've ever been given   okay well you know a long time ago when   i was just starting in ministry someone   said to me christine make the decision   right at the beginning that you can   never be offended   and you will never take offense because   if you   can be offended you will be and   inevitably in your life   people will hurt you people will betray   you   uh you know people in some way will do   something   where you will have the opportunity to   take offense   if you take offense it will lead to   bitterness when bitterness takes root in   your heart it will take you out and you   will always sabotage your ministry   more likely from the inside out than the   outside in   so just make a decision you can't be   offended   wow come on let's just start this off   with some fire whoa that's good   uh thank you that is so good i need that   i need to hear that right now just   starting off in ministry not to be   offended because even if you're not in   ministry that that's really good advice   i read this um   post recently and it was all about like   the gift and the art of not being   offended and being unoffendable and it   challenged me so much so that that's so   good i love getting it started like that   um like i kind of mentioned before you   came on that   you know this conversation we're about   to have kinda was sparked by   a conversation we've already had um one   day i just called her because   honestly i was kind of wrestling with   some questions that i had   about the bible about the call of god   and people have   asked me for a long time like what does   it mean to be called by god what does   the call of god mean in your life and   honestly i've always had a hard time   answering that so one day i texted   christine i was like hey   can i call you ask you some questions   and it was   so enlightening and helpful for me and i   wanted everybody to get to hear this   primarily because i know that all of our   audience a lot of you are young a lot of   you have asked me these questions so i'm   going to take it to somebody who   i asked the questions to so christine   can you help explain to people   like what does it mean to be called by   god and then follow that with   is everyone called by god or what does   that kind of look like   you know sadie firstly i just want to   commend you because   i just love your heart and willingness   to learn i remember when you texted me   and then that turned into like a   one-hour plus conversation   and you just like and i love i love your   willingness to learn and then to share   it   uh with your community because you know   i am more than double your age so that   kind of locates where i'm at and calling   is something i don't think we talk   almost enough about in your generation   and it's very important because at the   end of the day   uh jesus ultimately calls every one of   us   to himself that's the beginning and   that's the ultimate calling   is to christ himself and you know   throughout scripture we see different   examples and of course one of the   most prominent examples is when jesus is   walking along the shoreline of capernaum   in the gospels and he says to the who   were to become his disciples   he simply says uh follow me you know he   says to peter he says to john he says   follow me and the bible says immediately   they dropped their nets and followed him   and that has always   captured me even when i was your age and   first sense that call of god   because it was like they didn't say   number one who are you   where should we follow you to how long   should we follow you for   what salary package are you offering us   is it going to be easy   and what are the perks associated with   following you   yeah there was none of that there was   something obviously so magnetic   there was something so compelling there   was something   so amazing about this man jesus that   there was no questions asked   they just dropped what they were doing   they dropped where they were going   they dropped their own dream of being   fishermen they dropped their own purpose   of starting a fishing business   and simply followed him not knowing   where that was going to take them and   ultimately   it took them to their death that's what   it costs to follow jesus   wow wow that's so good i think you're   you're right that we don't talk about   enough i think sometimes when we talk   about it   it seems to be talked about of like what   our specific call is and it has to do   with what we're doing   or our job or our title or where we're   gonna go but   i love how you're saying it wasn't about   that at all they they didn't know what   they were gonna get paid they didn't   in fact they weren't gonna get paid   anything they didn't know how long it   was gonna be what it was gonna look like   what how it was gonna benefit   them it was all about following him and   so   that's whenever you were talking to me   that day i was like man that brings so   much clarity because i think sometimes   you know we make that about us instead   of making the call   about him and so i love that you   simplify it to a call   the call of god is called to christ   himself   um i want to ask you you know you   obviously are doing so many things now   you run so many different things and i   want to get into all that but   did you always feel called specifically   to the things that you're doing now   or are you shocked by them no yeah i'm   shocked i love   that question because here is the deal i   don't know   how in your 20s or your 30s you can say   with absolute confidence this very thing   this one thing this specific thing is   what god   has called me to do because here is the   deal one of the things   that i perhaps would be known for is my   work with a21 you know where we are   fighting to abolish slavery everywhere   we   help to rescue the victims of human   trafficking and i have   uh 22 officers in 18 countries so we are   fighting this thing on a global level   but i'm 54 years old sadie and i did not   even know   that human trafficking existed until i   was 40.   so at 20 i couldn't have said to you   i am called to fight slavery i didn't   even know it existed   the thing is as i i knew i was called to   jesus there is   no doubt that i felt this   tug in my heart to just drop everything   and follow him   but i had no idea what that meant i   didn't know that that would mean   i would be a communicator or i would be   a preacher i didn't know that it meant i   would write books i didn't know that it   meant i would   lead a global anti-trafficking   organization or a women's movement   i never knew any of those specific   things i just knew i was called   to him and so i just started right where   i was in my   local youth group in sydney australia   and   what i started doing was serving by   driving four teenage girls   to youth group because i had a license   and they didn't   and so that was the beginning of my   calling did god come into my bedroom and   say   i want you to drive young girls to youth   group and then   no i never had that but it was just a   practical thing   because i felt that i wanted my life to   count for the kingdom of god that's   all i knew that's all i knew that's so   good yeah i think that's really cool   because i think at times like   what happens is we can kind of get into   this complacency   mindset because we're like we say yes to   jesus we have this moment   at a conference we have this moment   church and then we like wait   until like we hear the voices of god say   go and do this   that's almost like what we expect to   happen in the meantime   we're letting like so much time go by um   and we're not really doing anything for   his kingdom   because we're waiting on like the big   thing to happen and i always want to   encourage you like   don't wait for like a stage to just   magically appear   and for you to talk to like go invite   like three people to your house and   start   preaching start sharing the gospel and   so i love what you're saying you're like   i didn't hear god say go and drive these   girls   to you you just did it because i was a   part of following him i love it i love   it i love it   um i want to talk to you so this is kind   of i've never done this on the podcast   before but also we   never just completely gone from a   conversation we had   to the podcast so i pulled some quotes i   just remember you saying that day on the   phone that i want to unpack because   when i heard you say these things i was   like everybody my chance to hear this   so one of the things you said you were   talking about how like not all   information   is wisdom um and i wanted you to unpack   that for us because we're getting   a lot of information these days how do   we   know what is good to look at and what is   not   yeah i think that's a great question and   you know one of the   challenges when it comes to calling uh   in the 21st century   and you know i think i might have said   this to you in our conversation   i am so grateful that i was saved before   there was an   internet and before there was social   media and so that really impacted my   calling   because i could not go online and start   scrolling through everybody else's   calling and compare myself with them and   go   i want to do what they're doing or i   think i've got i'm more gifted   than them in this thing therefore that's   what god must be calling me to   i had to get in my prayer closet with my   bible   and the holy spirit and begin to serve   in my local church   and out of that it was revealed   to me like over time just by serving   um as god strengthened my muscle in one   area   he opened a door to another one so   rather than me trying to build a   platform   i waited for god to open doors building   a platform is very dangerous because if   you build your platform you have to keep   your platform   if god builds it for you god puts you on   it and god   keeps you on it and then you're not   trying to protect what god already   gave you and so in the midst of um   all of that i i think that the critical   thing   is that we have to be very careful of   not trying to tell god   what we think we should be doing because   god is the one   that knows what we should be doing and   here is the deal   god is able to do exceedingly abundantly   above and beyond   anything we could ever ask hope or think   so if you and i   try to limit god to what i can do in my   natural talent   or what i can do in my natural gift or   what i think is a good idea   i am limiting god because in isaiah 55   it says that god's thoughts are higher   than my thoughts   god's ways are higher than my ways   corinthians says that my eye has not   seen   my e has not heard nor has it entered   into my heart what god has for me   so i want to know how do we ever think   that we could actually really know the   breadth of what god could do through our   lives   because god is able to do exceedingly   abundantly above   and beyond so give me the quote again   and let me directly answer the quote   that you said for out of our   conversation great that's so good   first of all i just i love what you just   said and i attest to that because   i was just talking to christian   yesterday i was like had   i know had somebody told me five years   ago what i would be doing i think it   would have scared me so bad   i don't even know how i would have like   ran into it but i'm so   glad that i just like kept trusting god   and listening to god   because now like my confident trust that   has been built in him   i like know he's gonna come through for   me in those moments i don't feel like   i'm capable of a moment and so i love   what you said so good um the quote was   you said   not all information is wisdom   yeah because here is the deal the   scripture says to us   uh that the fear of the lord is the   beginning of all wisdom   so if there is not a bottom line fear of   the lord of course when i say that you   know i'm not saying like i'm scared of   god he's going to be mean to me   god is gracious god is loving god is   kind   god is for us his plans for us are good   for good and not for evil their plans   to prosper us and not to harm us so i'm   not talking about   that kind of uh evil forebodings or that   god is mean   but i am saying that there's a healthy   reverential fear   that god is god and i am not now a lot   of the information that we're getting   and that's why i'm circling back to the   internet i said i was glad i got saved   before there was an internet   most of our information now comes just   from the internet or from our friends or   from the media   but just because something is   information or somebody's opinion does   not make it wisdom there is a huge   difference between wisdom that is that   is rooted and grounded in the fear of   the lord and the word of god   verse somebody's experience or   somebody's opinion   or somebody's thought and so my bottom   line is   if someone is saying something to me   that is not rooted and   grounded in a healthy reverential fear   of when i say that i mean   understanding god is god i am not that   my   thoughts my opinions uh my   plans for the future don't come out of   me just wanting to live   my best life now or me just wanting to   do what i'm good at   but come out of this fear of god in a   healthy way   that i am seeking the face of god i'm   seeking the purpose of god   i'm seeking the will of god i'm seeking   the word of god   out of that comes wisdom because   otherwise what seems to be a good idea   today   is a really dumb idea tomorrow and it   really could   reap a lot of negative uh reports and   here's the one good thing about living   long you know i'm in my mid 50s   half of you guys listening to this   podcast right now like you can't even   imagine that someone could live that   long but yes we do   all you have to do is just not die and   you'll still be here when you're 50.   so the good thing about following jesus   for more than 30 years so i've been   following jesus longer than you've been   alive   it means that i've seen lots of cycles   of things that are trendy today things   that are cool today   you know whether it's uh fashion or   opinion or the latest   cause that's out there if your life   is driven by the approve the need for   approval of people if your life is   driven by the need for likes or shares   then you will quickly uh go down a   downward spiral into a pit of depression   and a pit of anxiety because there will   never be enough to please   people what you have to do real wisdom   is going i am seeking to please god not   man   i am looking for the approval of god not   man   i'm not looking for the next trendy   sound bite that's going to get me a lot   of clicks   and a lot of shares i'm looking for   something that will have   eternal rewards that will transform   people's lives   and just like i've got you know you're   you're having a baby i've got   two daughters now that are almost 19 and   15.   now listen just because my daughters say   to me and give me a whole lot of   information every day about how much   they love ice cream   and they would love ice cream for   breakfast lunch and dinner   and they would love chocolate sauce on   their ice cream i'm not going to give   them that because that's not wise   that diet is going to end up destroying   them it's going to destroy their body   their focus it's going to shorten their   lifespan   that's not wisdom wisdom is you know   what sometimes i'm gonna have to give   you broccoli even when you hate it   i'm gonna have to give you brussels   sprouts even when you don't like it   and wisdom from the word of god says i'm   going to give you a full diet and guess   what sometimes you're not going to like   what you hear   sometimes you're not going to like what   you have to obey but if you do it   it's going to prosper your life and it's   going to bless your life if you   don't do it and just take your latest   information   from what someone down the road or what   some celebrity that does not follow god   if you just take your advice from there   your life will unravel instead of   prosper   wow come on that's so good i wanna like   i wish i was listening to this podcast   so i could rewind and listen to that   again   so if you are listening i hope that you   really take in everything that she's   saying and i hope you understand too you   don't have to have   a crazy amount of influence as far as   being an influencer per se on instagram   to do the things that you like   wherever you are in your life if you   know one person like   this is for you like she's talking to   you so i don't want you to just   miss this and say well that doesn't   apply for me this applies for every   single one of you   christine you actually i heard you talk   about this the other day at the q   conference we were talking about   you know we're not even called to be   influencers whatever that is   and and so what do you what would you   say to a generation who   is seeking for this social media   influencer title this like you said   building that platform out kind of thing   what would you say to them about just   kind of getting your head on straight   for what your   purpose what your call actually is with   the influence that you have   yeah i'm so glad that you said that   because how sad would life   be if our significance and security   came from a blue check mark on a   on an account how sad is that see our   significance   our security our our identity is rooted   in the fact that the king   of the universe sacrificed his life for   us on a cross   so that we could be saved and we could   have eternal life no   blue check mark is going to give you   eternal life no blue check mark is going   to give you significance or security   um or any sense of ultimate salvation   only jesus can do that and nowhere in   the scriptures   from genesis to revelation does it ever   say your highest calling   is to be an influencer now jesus said if   you are found in me   you already are an influencer the   scripture says that we are called   to be witnesses jesus said in the book   of john for this   cause the son of man came to the earth   that   my life he says would bear witness to   the truth   and then he calls every one of us so he   has said to   every christ follower every apprentice   of jesus   whether you have a blue check mark or   not he says   that we are called to go into all the   world and make   disciples every follower of jesus christ   is called to do that and it's time in   the body of christ   that we understand that is our calling   that we are to make   jesus's last commandment our first   priority   okay what we have done is sold out for   something that makes us think we think   if it is known by man if it is   celebrated by man   if it is applauded by man if it is   recognized by man   if it has a blue check mark next to it   it must be important   we have confused the accolades of man   with the approval of god   and yet god throughout scripture has   always looked for people   that are willing to honor him to obey   him   in anonymity and in obscurity of course   there's the famous story   where david a 13 year old boy was in the   back of the field   looking after his father's sheep there   was no instagram there was no tick tock   there was no anything   and he was doing the father's business   he was looking after the sheep he was   playing his harp he was killing bears he   was killing lions protecting the sheep   he was doing everything in anonymity and   obscurity   and then when the prophet samuel came   and the lord said to him   i have finished with saul i have   anointed a new king   what we would be doing in our age of   influences we would have a whole younger   generation   uh putting their profiles on instagram   and putting their filters and cropping   it and putting all the right   images on and going pick me pick me i   should be the king   i'm the best at this i'm the greatest   and we think i've got to build my   brand i've got to build my platform and   yet   when the prophet went to jesse's house   to select   the king jesse the father of the house   brought his seven sons that were the   high profiles man they were the   influencers they all had the blue check   mark   they looked the best they had the most   amount of followers   they look like they were awesome and yet   the lord said   to samuel i have not chose one by one he   went through these are all the blue   check mark people   i have not chosen him i have not chosen   him i have not chosen him   it doesn't matter if you've got 16 check   marks in front of you   if god has not chosen you and god hasn't   not anointed you   god will not appoint you and then the   prophet had to say   to uh to jesse the father of the house   he said to him well is there anybody   else because it's not any of these   influences and   the father of the house said oh i've got   this kid   that number eight i didn't even remember   him he's out in the field   he doesn't have a check mark he doesn't   even have an instagram account he's like   a loser   he's looking after the sheep and then   samuel goes go and get him   and as soon as he was brought in the   prophet then the lord said to the   prophet   that's the one that i've chosen you can   read this in first samuel 16.   and so here is the deal that it doesn't   matter   how big you build your pr brand or your   platform   if the lord has anointed you   and the lord has appointed you the lord   will find you   so the prophet can get it wrong the you   might go well my pastor doesn't even   recognize it no one around me recognizes   the gift of god on me   just be faithful where you are because   when god's ready for you   god will find you if god has assigned   you god will find you   god did not promote me because of a   platform   i had a ministry for 20 years before   there was social media so it was never   been   people go well you got all these   followers christine or that was never   that was just   that is just an outworking um of what   the lord is doing that's just stewarding   what the lord's already done through my   life   that's not me building it so that the   lord can do something   i was doing something before there was   ever any of that and then the lord   came and found me in anonymity and   obscurity in the back of sydney   australia   where i was faithful with 20 kids in   youth groups in country towns where   nobody knew my name   nobody knew anything but i loved the   lord and can i tell you sadie i was as   passionate then than i am today   i was as cold then as i was today i   prayed like there was   i mean i thought i had arrived because i   never knew that you could go anywhere   else   because i thought once god puts his hand   on you once god   uses you and you that could be in the   marketplace that could be   if you're a corporate ceo that could be   if you uh you know working in a   supermarket that could be if you've got   your own business that could be   your school teacher it doesn't matter   what your profession is   if you wake up every day and you know   that as a son or a daughter of the king   you have been called by god almighty to   make disciples   that changes your whole day you don't   need anyone to validate you with your   blue check you've been   validated by the king of kings and the   lord of lords come   on let's go i was so   like i was just so glad we're having   this conversation now you all know why i   texted her and said i need some advice   because   you're filled with wisdom you're filled   with the spirit you're so knowledgeable   of the word   and that is wisdom right there so thank   you for that that's gonna help   so many people i'm like laughing i'm so   excited   um one of the other things that that you   said and i kind of just want you to   um help challenge i guess this   generation you said that a lot of times   we put so much value on authenticity and   not as much value as we need to on   integrity   and i know the bible talks about how the   godly walk with integrity and so what   does that look like to   walk with integrity integrity and an   integrated person it means that you're   the same person that people see uh   publicly in whatever your sphere of   influence so   whether that's your online uh presence   but also   in your school in your university with   your friends in the workplace   and who you are internally because here   is the danger   say if there is a disparity between your   inner world and your outer world your   world   will collapse now of course when i'm   talking about integrity i'm not saying   that we're   uh perfect we all make mistakes we   all mess up we all have different areas   of our life that we're working on   that we're still uh being conformed and   transformed to the image of god so that   never   that does not mean that we never fail or   we never make mistakes and   that we have to make things right but   when i i'm talking about   we so value we somehow think man if i'm   just authentic online which means i put   just all my dirty laundry out there and   you just suck it up man you just like   this is just who i am and i'm like   uh if you are not godly why would you be   celebrating that like you know it's just   like   accept me yeah who i am man if i'm just   like angry or i'm just promiscuous or   i'm just   uh a gossiper or i'm just a slanderer or   i'm just   jealous but just deal with it man that's   just who i am i'm like uh how about you   change   to become like jesus why should i have   to deal with   it there are some things that we should   navigate in private with trusted mentors   and   there is something about this generation   that just thinks man i've just got to   put it all out there and here is the   truth   you don't need to put it all out there   the scripture says in the book of   revelation   that we will be saved by the blood of   the lamb the word of our testimony   and that we love not our lives unto   death the deal   is don't confuse a story with a   testimony   we all have stories but sometimes it   takes a long time for a story to become   a testimony   and the testimony is where there is   victory in an area where you can   actually   speak into something now you can use   your story but you've got a testimony   from it   and so you come from a place of victory   not a place of arrogance but a place of   victory   and so you know you know i come from a   background of of abuse and adoption and   abandonment   and so you know there was a long time   though that i was so full of shame and   guilt and   anger and bitterness and unforgiveness   and man i could have gone online and   shared my story and just   vented all my pain all my wounds   but if i was just venting out of my   wounds wounded people   wound people i would have just wounded a   whole lot more people   and so what i had to do was allow the   holy spirit and through wise counsel and   if necessary therapy   and the word of god to bring healing and   wholeness in my life so now   what was a very dark season   of my story has become a testimony that   has brought hope   and healing and health to others my   recommendation would always be   that you take time to turn a story into   a testimony because   if you begin to bleed   too soon over people then you are just   going to hemorrhage and you're going to   have no life left and you're going to   have damaged a whole lot of people   and so we don't got to not place such   higher value on just   authenticity i'm not talking about   living a double life but i am simply   saying there needs to be wisdom about   how much of your life   you share and where and how you do it   and one day you know if you want to be   married or if you want to be in   relationship you want to have children   there are many things that you're going   to wish you never put online in your   early 20s   or in your teenage years and so i think   some of that is where we just have to   exercise   uh wisdom and i think we need to honor   people that have integrity not just   authenticity so   just putting my sinful life out there   and saying   man i'm cool i'm just being authentic   that that   that is nothing to be celebrated an   integris life is an honest life it says   you know maybe this is an area i've   struggled in   this could be an area i'm still   struggling but you are not   exalting sin as a lifestyle and going   this is cool because i'm just living   you know my life and yeah and that's how   it is what you are doing an integris   life   says god has this holy standard   according to his word and   you know i'm not there yet i would never   say i'm there i've got so far to go yeah   but i'm on my way   and this is the wisdom that i want so   i'm going to be integrous with you all   and   and share some of my challenges but i'm   not going to share everything because   sadie there's a difference between   uh privacy and secrecy and they're you   know   no big secrets in my life but i do have   a lot of private things in my life that   i don't think need to be out there   uh for everyone and i think we need to   discern   um secrets will kill you and you're only   as healthy as you you know your deepest   secrets so you   you've got to be careful about keeping   secrets you need to go   to wise people that can help you i'm not   talking about   shoving things down and denying it i'm   never one that's into denial or   dismissing   i'm like you know uh what you don't   reveal   god cannot heal but i'm saying that the   best place to reveal it   is not firstly on social media the best   place to reveal it   is to a trusted wise counsel   somebody that i can actually help you   because um just putting it all out there   for everybody   not everybody loves you not everybody   cares about you not everybody is   for you and not everybody is full of   god's wisdom   and so if you want true health and   healing and wholeness   it's only in the the places   of anonymity in the dark room with jesus   where it's you the word the holy spirit   and trusted christian counsel   that over a period of time can bring   healing and   wholeness and health and vitality into   your spiritual life so that you can move   forward   come on that's so good that was so   helpful honestly to me i feel like   um that was so helpful because i think   sometimes it's hard like with social   media   i know like obviously gets a bad rep   there's a lot of bad things about it and   we don't always use it right we don't   always use it great   but it is like the first thing that like   we've had   as like a younger generation that the   older generation hasn't gone before us   and done so it's like   you don't get a lot of wisdom from the   older generation like you do in other   areas of life because they don't quite   understand it you know so it's really   helpful and thank you for   like taking the time to actually   understand it   you you recognize what's going on you   also are you're huge on social media if   you don't follow christine you got to go   follow her because   she posts so many encouraging things   you'll get this every day on her   instagram   which i love because again that's you're   authentic but you had so much integrity   you're the same person   on this as you are on there you're   preaching the gospel through and through   but again like you just don't get that   much wisdom from the older generation in   this and i think sometimes maybe that's   why   you know we're running around like   chickens with our heads cut off on   social media not really knowing   how to use this as a tool or how to use   this for the good   and so that's so helpful that was such a   good guideline there was so much wisdom   into that   i wanted to talk about a21 because i   think what you're doing is   absolutely incredible again if you don't   follow her go follow her because you   post so many stories i actually watched   the 10 minute story today   that you just posted about one of the   girls who was rescued and   it's just so powerful the things that   you're doing and so how can we   as my following is whether it's good   friends how can we help support a21 and   what you're doing   i think one of the best is i'm glad you   asked that and can i just want to   backtrack a bit and say sadie i'm so   glad you made that point about   you're the first generation that has to   navigate this this is why i love you all   so much because i'm like oh   man you guys are legends can i say   though that you are the first generation   in the history of planet earth   that actually have at your disposal the   tool   that could lead to the evangelization of   planet earth before the second coming of   christ   this generation because of the internet   and because of social media   we actually for the first time in human   history have the tools in our hand   where we could get the job done   evangelizing the earth   before the second coming of christ and   that's why i think the enemy wants to   hijack it so much   and that's why it's so great that you're   having wisdom to go hey i've got a whole   lot of followers in that generation   and you love your followers so much that   you're like man we could use this   yeah for so much good that's why um   i'm always such a fan of social media   and i'm so engaged because i know it can   be used for good i just know the enemy   wants to use it for bad as well so   you guys actually could usher in the   second coming of christ believe it or   not you you are the generation that can   do that so   that fires me up big time and i think   again what i also love about your   generation is i love that for you guys   you don't separate the gospel from   justice   to you it's not like two separate things   like going to church on sunday for you   has to impact what happens in the world   on monday otherwise it's irrelevant and   i love that you know gone are the days   where   you just go to church listen to some   sermon you don't even understand   and the world is dying every other day   so i   love that so much about millennials and   gen z   it's just like you you actually really   care about the whole world   and you care about the poor and the   marginalized and of course   victims that are in trafficking because   it is an abomination   that the fastest growing crime worldwide   is the trafficking of human beings that   are created in the image of god i mean   are you kidding me   of that in 2020 we can't have this   figured out that you do not buy and sell   human beings   for sex or because you want a cheap   t-shirt or a cheap cup of coffee are you   kidding me   and so the fact is we can actually get   something done which is really   what blows me away and so what i love um   and   when i started a21 it was with this   intention it wasn't like   so we could create any one hero it's so   that all of us together   could actually make a difference and you   know sadie   on uh our website 821.org   it's so simple there are there are 21   different ways   that today um today you could do   something   in your world wherever people are   listening to this all over the world   whatever age they are whatever season of   life they are   there is 21 things and you could just   scroll down and go you know what i could   do that one thing today it'll take me   30 seconds and it could actually help to   rescue a human being   out of sex trafficking that's amazing   all right everybody seriously right now   go to a21.org   and do one of the 21 it if only one   you might somebody might do all 21 do it   all go help out in whatever way you can   christine that's so encouraging thank   you for just empowering us   a lot of people speak down on this   generation like   we are just the worst and this social   media has ruined us and so thank you for   actually like   empowering us and speaking to the good   of what we can do yes   acknowledging the evil that the enemy   can use in the midst of it but also   acknowledging how god can use it for   good and even   for something so huge as as the second   coming   that's just amazing to even think about   it gets me so excited and it just makes   me   want to take it so much more seriously   and so thank you for your wisdom and   sharing that   uh lastly just wanted to mention i know   we have passion 2021 coming up   one which we haven't even talked about   but i'm so excited   that we're both gonna be a part of   passion um   everybody if you haven't gotten your   ticket to passion christina and i will   both be there along with several people   but we are just   there to share the good news the good   news is the gospel of jesus christ we're   gonna end this year declaring life   and so we're so excited christina can't   wait to join you with that and thank you   so much again for just   sharing your wisdom to this generation   and empowering us i   can't wait to see um the outcome and the   effect that this conversation has on   people's life and   i know it's already affected mine in a   huge way so thank you so much   well you know i i love you and and again   we started the year together at passion   2020 and we're going to end it together   at passion 2021 and the   banner over this year is going to be   jesus because he is good news   full of great joy for all people and i'm   so grateful that you   you know i just want to uh reiterate are   talking about   calling because it is crucial uh   in a world that is all talking about man   you just live your best life now you   just   uh you do you boo you know you know me i   just think that's the worst   advice we could ever give anyone it's so   dangerous i'm like no   we we have to remind a generation that   if we   are going to truly get the job done of   why we are here on this earth as the   church of jesus christ   uh which is to lead people to jesus then   we have to learn afresh what it is to   take up our cross   to die daily and to follow jesus and we   have to understand our calling is not   just about my comfort   it's not just about my convenience it's   it's going to be costly   it's got we got brothers and sisters all   over the world your age   um that are laying down their lives   daily for the cause of the gospel that   are   being martyred for their faith and so   what we need is a generation   that rises up and says jesus whatever   i'm dropping my nets i'm going to die to   myself   i'm going to take up my cross and i'm   going to follow   you and do whatever you have called me   to do if we   get that generation we are going to have   a revival generation   you are also technologically advanced   you are   all so brilliant with social media and   the internet   if in your hearts from the inside out   you go jesus i'm   all in i honestly believe 20 21 22   23 we will see the greatest revival   in the history of the world it just   needs a generation that says   god's called me to him i'm 100   following him and whatever he wants to   do with my life he can do it but i've   decided to follow jesus   and i'm not turning back i'm all in oh   i'm so good   from from my generation to yours they   would say period   like yes everything you just said i   i completely agree that gets me fired up   normally they uh don't show   me like because they're filming me right   now but they don't show me why you're   talking i wish they could see i'm   literally   smiling so big because it just fires me   up to talk to somebody who   has so much faith who believes so much   and it's everything i believe and i   think in this year it's hard because   we're so isolated a lot of times we   a lot of people can't actually go to   church and be encouraged by the body and   so i just hope that this is such an   encouragement to everybody that   people still have faith people are still   believing that god can do something huge   and at the same time if we pick up our   cross if we follow him if we doubt   ourself when we do these things to call   the gospel we will see that revival   and so christine thank you i love you   friend i   am so excited for this to go out i   adore you man i'm i'm running laps   myself you don't know how much i believe   in you   so you are the best ah thank you we love   you thank you so much for being on the   podcast   love you loads thanks for having me          all right as usual thank you so much for   sending in the good and bad advice to   the world that's good podcast instagram   and also on our ella sister app   we love it we appreciate it we laugh   about it i'm so christian   we don't cry something's wrong you do   all right if you don't like something   change it if you can't change it change   the way you think about it   great news well that's good great news   great news   we have great news coming for you today   no that's great news if you don't like   something   change it that's good because i think i   like people that are proactive i like   efficiency i like people that get stuff   done and change it if they need to   change it   yeah and if you don't like it change the   way you think about it that's great love   it   you won't find peace at the end of your   to-do list that's good   that is good that's good because to be   honest there's always going to be   something else you have to do   yeah and i think sometimes we so much   try to like over busify ourselves   and then when when we end up doing all   those things a lot of times it doesn't   really   complete us or like i don't know i think   there's always something   like we always think there's something   else to do that's so true no matter if   there truly is or not like we're always   guessed inside and so   only true peace is found in jesus   himself and   sitting with the father that's what i   believe and so set your to-do list down   sometimes and just   be with jesus yeah okay one second sorry   this is pregnancy man it humbles you i   gotta let it burp   she's pregnant no man again lightness   keep that rolling during the pockets   i'll be like oh gosh okay   um i'm really keep that rolling vision   without action is just a daydream   wow that's deep yeah it's super good   because i probably have a lot of i   wonder if that person like thought about   that or like heard that song   i have a lot of good well somebody said   it yeah but i'm saying like i wonder if   the person who sent that in like   thought about that or is that like   gandhi   i think i have a lot of good visions but   if i don't do anything with them   that's so true i'm just simply   daydreaming yeah very good   all

have this incredible   conversation with louie gaglio          are you ready for the question of the   will that's good podcast   i hope so i think i'm ready okay   what is the best piece of advice that   you have ever been given you know the   uh i was thinking all the way back to   different pieces of advice the best one   sadie   was uh it's two words are you ready for   this   ready and actually three words then   b1 now i have to back up and explain a   little bit   um i heard about this guy named john   piper like   25 years ago and i started reading one   of his books let the nations be glad   it was blowing my mind reading piper   books takes some concentration   and i thought man this guy's got a lot   to say but i showed up a little bit   later at a conference that i was   speaking at in sort of like the lower   level speaking   uh zone and he was the main speaker   and i can see the seat i was sitting in   right now   he gave his heartbeat message about   it all being about god's glory and why   that's the best thing for all of us   i barely could breathe i don't think i   breathe during   the message and i was riveted not only   by   what god was saying to me but how i knew   it was just going to change   everything about my life and we left   that session went up to this   uh sort of what would look like a   fellowship hall for any church type   people   for lunch and i was just over the table   and piper was up at the head table   and he was sitting by himself and the   other guys hadn't come to the table yet   so it's just john piper sitting there   eating and i'm over at another table   with some guys and i'm like i don't ever   go talk to people   i don't ever bother people but i'm gonna   go tell   john piper or something and so i you   know got up my nerve walked over there   and i said dr piper   um my name is louie i'm one of the other   speakers here and   i just wanted to tell you that i haven't   heard anyone speak like you just spoke   i said i haven't heard but five people   in my lifetime   speak like you just spoke   and he looked up at me he had green   beans on his fork   and he looked up at me it's only john   piper could and he said well   then be one wow and then there'll be six   of us   that's cool that is i kind of   snuck back over to my table   i am such an idiot and i don't know why   i went to talk to john piper   but it stayed with me and it's great   advice   because you know we all look up to   somebody we all admire somebody we all   want to be   something and i think the   when you just flip it around the best   advice is   do what it takes to be that then if   that's really the vision you have for   your life   then don't just tell that person that   you were really touched by what they did   commit yourself to being   that person and it really did set me   on a kind of awkward trajectory but it   is some of the best advice i've ever   gotten in my life   i love that that's so good oh man i hear   that all the time people come up to me   and they say   you know i want to be you i want to be   just like you want to do what you're   doing and so   that's such good advice especially for   people who   even come to conferences that you do   like the passion conference like   that i know the last thing you would   want is for somebody to leave and say i   want to be louis giggly or i want to be   a city   you want them to say i want to be more   like jesus and go out and live that life   and so   i think that is such good advice and   short we can all remember that   then be one i do want to talk to you   about the passion conference because   obviously so many college students have   been impacted that   by that um one question i just have for   you is why college students why   uh do you and shelly pour your heart out   to the 18 to 25 year old person   you know sadie i set out to love god and   to serve him and i   never thought about being in college   ministry i ended up   super short story being a summer college   intern while i was in grad school   at seminary and the first summer i ended   up at this church   being a college intern for the summer   never done college ministry   really wasn't on my radar but i ended up   doing that the next couple of summers   and while i was doing it   i started dating shelly she was at   baylor i started spending my weekends at   baylor and i went to an urban campus   and so i went to kind of college at home   we called it 13th grade   growing up in atlanta georgia i went to   georgia state university there was no on   campus   living at the time so i didn't really   get that college experience and   now i'm spending weekends in waco   sleeping on guys couches and sleeping on   guys floors because i'm dating shelly   and   i'm learning oh this is how college   works and in the summers   i'm pouring into these college kids   during these summer college internships   and i realized in that moment   the main thing that pushed us over the   edge sadie was realizing two things   number one a lot of followers of jesus   so   a lot of people i know listening today   aren't haven't made that decision and   maybe don't have a big faith component   but   for a lot of christians church people i   saw them   in their church summer college intern   world   and then i saw them the moment they hit   the campus and they were two completely   different people   and i realized this window this 18 to 25   year old window   it's where people make the decisions   that shape the rest of their life   they meet their wife they get their   friend group they get a trajectory going   for their   world and and it's where people decide   is this my parents faith   or is this my faith and we have to work   that out   and secondly if you saw the movie about   facebook   and you go back to mark zuckerberg   facebook runs the world by the way   and it runs the world because it it went   crazy on a college campus   and the campus is an incredible   incubator for all kinds of things   and if the gospel is that thing then the   college campus i believe can   possibly be the best place on planet   earth for the gospel to change the world   so great come on everybody who's   listening i want you to hear that   that is louis igloo saying that the   college campus can be   the greatest place to spread the gospel   and i think you know sometimes we get   intimidated   by the stereotype that college students   have   or maybe that you have as a college   student but   be that person to break that stereotype   all it takes is   preaching the gospel all it takes is the   power of jesus to see   people go from death to life that that   literally is all it takes is just living   it out and so louie   it means so much you know that you guys   believe in that 18 to 25 year old   age group so much clearly because i am   in that age group and   i think about the fact that you all   started passion and   even before that you were doing college   ministry you were doing ministry in   general   but you started it before i was even   born and now you're welcome   welcoming us like me and others into it   and you believe in that next generation   and so what is the importance for you   that you're kind of setting up the next   generation   to win and to be you know outspoken for   the gospel   i think it's just that viewpoint sadie   that you know you can you drive by these   churches all the time that you see that   there are more people   in the cemetery of the church than you   could possibly fit in the church   and there's one of those used to be on   the street at the road that shelly and i   lived on   we don't live on that road now but we   saw it every day and i would drive by it   i'd be like you could only fit 128   people in that church   but yet it looks like there's about 528   people in the cemetery   next door and so you have to have a view   to the future   the gospel is always future jesus died   on friday but the story really hit its   peak on sunday   yeah jesus was raised from the dead but   you know pentecost came and by that time   he'd already ascended back into heaven   he sent it into heaven and said i'm   going to come and   set my foot back down on this mountain   and so we're all waiting for that moment   so the gospel is future forward and so   leaders have to be that way and frankly   i just   am energized by that that moment   that that convergence of the 20 years   the 30-year   window where people have all the   possibility in front of them and   my friends are talking about retiring   and what they're going to do   you know in the last chapter of their   life and i'm like that is so uninspiring   to me   i want to be around people who are   looking to the future and   sadie you are the future and so   the way a lot of leaders say it is that   you you look through people   so you don't look to somebody oh you're   going to be the person you're always   looking   through that person not like they're not   important but   who's the next person and who's the   person after them and that's what jesus   was doing he was looking at his   followers but   he didn't just look to the 12 he looked   through the 12.   and when he looked through the 12 he   could see me and so when he was   preaching to them   he was always including me and those who   will come after you that was me   and so uh i think it's that's what keeps   us going and keep us focused   on on the young generation the next   generation if you will   yep so good i just encourage you know   young people i know   for the most part that's the majority of   listeners you know i think   we want the older generation to believe   in us so much but i encourage you   believe in the older generation too   i was having a conversation with people   the other day   and they're in gen z you know my   generation and   they were just kind of struggling   wanting to listen to wisdom from older   generations saying they couldn't   understand what we go through you know   they   didn't have the social media back and   the whole thing and i'm like yeah they   might not understand   that element of your life but on a heart   level they do they've gone through all   the same feelings you're going through   and you need their wisdom and i always   think that like when   wisdom and when that younger zeal joins   together you see these powerful things   happen and so   we need that collaboration and i just   love that you've welcomed me to the   table   and so many other young people um   speaking of young people though i know   what every young person   loves to hear about is relationships and   you kind of mentioned   you and shelly y'all's dating years and   all of those things um   today actually when the podcast is going   live   this is me and christian's one year   anniversary   me yeah yes so one year ago you were   actually   um the pastor at our wedding and i   thought it was so special that you   happen to be on the podcast today   um but i want to talk about dating well   you know and   ask you if you feel like in how you and   shelley dated   did it set you up well for how y'all's   marriage is today   and if not that's okay honestly you can   say no   our dating wasn't great we've learned a   lot in marriage or do you think there   were   elements to how you all dated that that   set you up well to have a good marriage   yeah well hey congratulations and your   wedding was absolutely like   out of this world you got married on a   tennis court for those   people who don't know but man you would   have never known there was a tennis   court under there   and it was such a special night when you   have people come literally from around   the world to celebrate you guys   and can i just share one thing real   super quick so i think there was a delay   we were waiting on the shuttle buses   or something was taking longer and there   was like a little gap of time and   christian was super nervous he was   pacing around and it was just me and him   all y'all are up at the tennis court and   the little   house behind the tennis court and   christian and i were staying in the   kitchen and i was like   man i don't know if christian's gonna   make it he's awesome i know he's gonna   make it but you know what i'm saying   it was just like he was he was nervous   but just so happens your dad has a golf   hole right out in your backyard   and so i went rummaging around and said   christian where does willie keep his   golf   clubs and he goes up in here so we're in   there digging out golf balls and golf   clubs and then there's   christian and me outside your house   chipping balls   up onto this green and neither one of us   were doing very good   but it was so awesome and it was one of   my favorite moments of life it just kind   of let all the air out of the space and   i think in the dating zone sadie that   the thing that's most important i think   in dating   is that you establish your purpose and   you   you decide when you're dating who are we   and what are we going to be   so that by the time shelley and i stood   up on the platform   in the old sanctuary at second baptist   church houston and said   we do we were committed to living   our lives for jesus we didn't know what   that looked like where it was going to   take us   we didn't know the details we just knew   we have been worshiping together   we've been singing at the praise songs   at the top of our lungs   right in the car together we have been   memorizing   god's word together we have been in   ministry together   and we we did long distance dating for   a couple of years and so we'd fought   that fight   and survived which i think is a good   thing   i think that just strengthens   relationships sometimes but we knew what   our purpose was   and so a lot of people date just wasting   time it's like what are we doing this   weekend and what are we doing next   weekend and you want to go to the lake   and you want to do this instead of going   what is life about and what is our life   about   and let's start doing that now if we   believe we're going to make an impact in   the world for jesus   let's start doing that now or say you're   out in business we want to build a   business   okay let's start working on a business   together or let's start serving the   community together   yeah and that way once you get married   it's not like oh now we're married now   we start our life it's not now we're   married we just continue our life   that's so good establish your purpose i   love that   and um it's funny you mentioned the the   golfing moment because that was   definitely one of christian's favorite   moments of   of he he actually just is on the other   side of the room he said of my life i   was gonna say of the wedding   and one of his favorite moments of his   life because yes he was so   nervous and that just brought him back   to the moment but   you even mentioned earlier we were   talking about me and christian's mission   statement   for our relationship and i can think   back to when we were dating and you know   we were constantly thinking of what our   purpose   is what our mission is while we're   dating and   those little taglines or those things   that we're both going for   the desires of our hearts talking those   out together were super important   so that we when we get married we could   you know hit the ground running and   with those things that we had already   talked about and prayed about and all   those things and if you are married and   you haven't ever done that and i was   like   that was a great time to start you know   making your marriage have purpose and   have vision and mission yeah i think so   many people say they think all you need   is love and that is so   not true you know life isn't about let's   just be in love life is about   we were created for a purpose and we   were put on earth for a purpose we all   are breathing air for a reason and   every family needs a purpose and it   starts with that couple so i   i just would take a step back tonight if   uh or today or whenever you're listening   to this podcast if you're in a   relationship and just say hey what   is our purpose and why do we   why are we better together than we are   apart   and what does god want to do through our   lives and   i think once you know that it gives you   some ballast in your boat it gives you   some direction because every couple is   going to face headwind there's going to   be   hard times in every relationship but the   purpose   is what sort of guides you through all   of you yeah so good   um i know one thing that you talk about   publicly   is anxiety and you talk about that and   goliath must fall and   i feel like we couldn't do a podcast and   not touch on it because both of us have   struggled with   just the grip of anxiety and i know this   year especially in the midst of covid   it has sparked you know a lot of people   who maybe haven't ever struggled or   those who've struggled for a long time   for it to be even heavier of a grip and   so   just honestly i have nothing else to say   but   just can you give some advice to the   person who is walking in the midst   of that really dark struggle of anxiety   right now   this is going to sound simplistic sadie   but you know i've been down in a deep   deep hole of depression and so   nothing i say is simplistic i take   mental illness depression anxiety it's   super serious   it can take you out but at the same time   you're gonna make it that's what i want   to say to that person   you're hearing voices telling you you're   not going to make it but those are not   coming from your creator they're not   coming from your maker they're not   coming from your shepherd who said i'm   going to lead you through the valley of   the shadow of death   i'm not going to drop you off somewhere   i'm going with you all the way through   it   and when i was in that deep hole the   thing i had to fight against and that   god gave me the grace to overcome in   in an amazing way was that i i didn't   think i was going to make it   and i think once you believe that long   enough you finally succumb to that   and then you don't make it and so it's   just writing a simple statement today   i'm going to make it i today we're   recording this podcast on your   anniversary   and this is a day in the year and we   made it   this is um a time of this is november   and   we made it we made it you're gonna make   it you may feel like there's a thousand   pounds on you today you may feel like it   it's dark and hopeless but you're going   to make it   you are going to make it and i think   when you start   changing your own personal narrative   like i don't feel better i don't feel   different i'm not talking about simple   solutions sadie a band-aid a   one-size-fits-all i'm just talking about   changing your narrative   and just saying you know what today is   the hardest day of my life   but i am going to make it in this   statement   and something about that lets a little   bit of light in   and the other thing and i've said this   before and people can hear this on a   message i gave called i'm not okay but   jesus   is that little sentence i'm not doing   good right now but jesus is doing okay   jesus is not suffering depression he   doesn't need medication   he doesn't need counseling and he's here   with me right now so   i do need some of those things i need   help i need a doctor   i need a friend i need light i need   freedom but jesus is right here with me   and he's okay and if we can be open   about that   and not fake it till you make it you   can't do that with depression you have   to face it you have to be honest you   have to speak it out you have to be   vulnerable and transparent   and let the light in but i would just   encourage you change that little simple   narrative today you are going to make it   you made it this far and you're gonna   make it   it's great that's great i know that's so   needed for so many people to hear and if   you're listening and you're like i need   more of that   i highly suggest going to listen to i'm   not okay but jesus is that was   one of my favorite messages that you've   preached and i i loved several but that   one was so   impactful and then also like i said his   book goliath must follow i know you talk   about   just that battle and i have lived   fearless out too so if you need   more resources we put them out there and   i'd love for you to go   dive more into that um so good i know   despite you know talking about you   walking through depression and anxiety   one of the things just being up close in   your yours and shelley's life   something that you can't miss when you   talk to y'all is y'all live on   incredible faith i mean   people don't realize when they're at the   passion conference how much of it y'all   were actually just completely dependent   on god to show up and do   and god shows up and does it and so how   do you encourage someone to live   in that place of dependency on god   uh to increase their their faith well   you know you don't start by doing an   event at mercedes-benz stadium that's   not how you build your faith you start   by   taking one step and you take a small   step and trust god and   you do that with the counsel of people   around you you don't just haul off one   day and say i believe the lord told me   to go   do x y and z so i'm going to go trust   god   you you humble yourself to the people   around you   you discern what god's saying for you to   do   and you take a step and what you learn   is sometimes you get it wrong   but a lot of times you get it right and   then you see god come through   and it's like building up the callouses   on the end of your finger or building a   muscle or a muscle memory   you you do that again and god comes   through then you do that again and god   comes through and eventually you're   standing in front of this giant mountain   and you go god's gonna come through and   people are like how can you have that   kind of faith and you're like   i don't know i don't know how i can have   that kind of faith i just   kept taking little steps with god and   our passion story you know people say oh   y'all are the biggest thing going and   you just say passion and all these   people show up and they have no   idea how much work it takes and how much   faith it takes and how   every year we need multiple miracles to   happen i mean to get that flame from   jerusalem   to mercedes-benz stadium there are there   were a hundred   miracles that happened on that journey   and that was just one part   of passion 2020 and so   take the little step but do it with wise   people around you   and you don't have to haul off and   raise the dead just take the little step   and say god i'm going to trust you with   this and then i'm going to see   you come through and then take the next   step after that   and you end up you know at some pretty   big mountains and when you do you're not   intimidated by the size of the mountain   because you've already gotten to know   the size of your god   come on that's so good i love that   actually just last week on the podcast   we were talking with carrie jobe and she   was talking about how   right before passion they were praying   that the wind   of god would just come in it would come   in like a mighty rushing wind   people would feel it on their faces and   then of course   in that moment the top of the   mercedes-benz stadium opens up which was   not planned   and the way that the wind formed i mean   it was like a mighty rushing wind in the   place   and so we were just talking about that   moment and it was so cool   um speaking of passion i know so many   people have been so disappointed   that there is not gonna be a passion   2021 this year   but we have some good news to share with   everybody   who's been a little disappointed a   little sad about that that there   actually is gonna be a passion 2021   this year come on what i mean can i say   that right now   is that allowed i can't i don't even   know if that's like public   or anything it might just be like just   out today   but um hey everybody good news uh   we are going to be hosting passion 2021   on new year's eve yes we started this   year   the first minute of this year we were   praising god and we are going to end   this year   the last minute of this year praising   god   and people are going to say oh my gosh   tell me you're going to be back in   mercedes-benz i'm there   well i think people understand that   covet is kind of flipping things around   again   and we're kind of on the back side of uh   this thing again   and we're not making as much progress as   we want   so we are going to be hosting a global   gathering mostly online   and we're pumped about it and we are not   shrinking back but we're going forward   and   we just did not want the new year to   turn   without 18 to 25 year olds all around   the world linking   and declaring we believe even in this   year that god is still good   and we that was what we were singing   sadie   on the stroke of midnight we were   singing good grace   and it was true then and it's true now   and i we have been through the year of   our lives there will never be a year   like it i bet   in all of our lives but god has been in   it   and he has brought us through it and   that's the message that   i'm building my life on today god has   been in it amen   and he's bringing us through we baptized   a girl said he's super fast   um a college student who plays on the   tennis team at one of the schools in   town   she got baptized at church two weekends   ago   so that's awesome should be fun uh   amen's out there she's a major anxiety   struggler she will tell you that i mean   like   very very serious serious critical   fight against anxiety and depression but   she came to online church when craig   rochelle was speaking in the seven   series at passion city this summer and   craig spoke about anxiety   she'd never heard anybody at church talk   about anxiety she got saved that day   at church online wow and she got   baptized in   real life not online at church two weeks   ago one more college student   coming to passion 2020 2021 alive in   jesus so   even in this year uh there's so much to   celebrate   and i want i'm happy to say that sadie   and christian huff   and liv original are partnering with   passion this year   and together we are leading the charge   inviting a generation to come   and to live their lives for what matters   most and that's the glory of god so   i think there might be

together as a church   family with passion and   if you've never been to church in your   life this is a great place to tune in   because   i'm telling you there's going to be some   powerful things that happen   we believe that because we've always   said this that god is not   confined to our walls whether that's our   church walls whether that's   the walls of the mercedes-benz stadium   god's spirit lives within   us and it's wherever we are it's   wherever the body of people   are so we're going to be united on this   night even if we're in our own homes   either if we're in small gatherings   however this   pans out or however this looks it is   going to be a powerful moment that you   do not want to miss   and so go to passion.com go any you can   look at any of our instagrams i'm sure   after this it will be shout it out   because we are so excited to just get to   put   good news out there and of course the   good news is obviously the gospel   yes it's good

guys we are so   excited for the days to come   if you guys enjoyed this podcast which i   know you did because louie you had so   much good advice and we just thank you   so much for your wisdom   uh write it all down take it in don't   just listen and let it go out the other   ear actually let it fall on   to good soil but also send it to some   friends and let them know   passion 2021 is happening we want all of   you guys to be there   we're so so excited louis thank you   again so much   thanks sadie   what up everybody are you ready for some   good and bad advice   all right so we're actually sharing my   today so we're to be super close   i hope that doesn't bother anyone super   close um but we're married   okay so let's go through this let's do   it first of all thank you for sending a   good bad advice to the world that's good   podcast instagram   and our sister all right   babe does practice really make perfect   practice makes better than no practice   doesn't make perfect that's true it   doesn't make perfect but no i think i   mean   you look at anything with um you know   sports and   people who pursue their careers i mean   if it doesn't if you don't put in the   work then you're not going to get   the outcome that you're hoping for but   it does not make perfect i think that   that   is a lie that culture and that society   wants to tell us that you know the more   you try   the harder you try to get there then   you're gonna achieve it you're gonna be   happy but   true yeah i'm a big perfect does not   guarantee happiness   i'm a good big believer in practice not   so much perfect   because like even with when we talk   about like me speaking like people   probably think i just walk up there and   like   you know i prepared a message but man i   prepared that and i practice i   go over it so many times but then i   always say okay lord like   i give this to you because i don't want   it to be perfect like i don't want to go   there and like cookie cutter i want like   your spirit to lead me   so i don't even think perfect is like   what you want all the time   yeah yeah all right the secret of life   is to fall   seven times and to get up eight times   that's really good this is actually   really funny i was just reading proverbs   over there   and um it was the verse where solomon   says the rights just fall seven times   and get back up   um but pity a man um   you know the right just fall seven times   and you know we're going to have days   where we stumble more than others but   um you know getting back up is key and   you have to   you know have that yeah that's good   that's right that really strong i know i   was like i forgot the back end of that   verse   we always said we're going so strongly   like this something like that   um but that was great i love that advice   at first i didn't really understand it   but now i really like it because it's   even biblical   all right when you can't find the   sunshine be the sunshine   i love that it sounds like a mary   poppins kind of thing   i think of emma jenkins my good friends   in vegas she is the sunshine on a rainy   day you know like   we are going to be the light of the   world so yes   we are we should be the sunshine when we   can't find it yeah you are my sunshine   you make me happy   i wanted to start seeing with you but   you were so   off because you can't imagine i can't   you can't match this falsetto baby   that wasn't even falsetto this is   awk that was 100 falsetto oh   is funny okay   move one small stone at the time soon   you will find that you've moved a   mountain   i think it's good yeah i i didn't hear   you kind of stumble the beginning of   that   move one small stone at a time soon you   will find that you moved a mountain   i actually heard this one time it's very   motivationally inspiring   i don't know that this is true but i   heard this one time that like when jesus   said like if you have faith to move a   mountain   like if you could like if you said this   mountain like move   then it would like fall into the hardest   sea at that time like   people actually would work to actually   move mountains like   they would put in the work to move a   stone at a time so like move a mountain   and so   like jesus was saying like if you're if   you have faith like if you   want that to happen like yes like it can   happen like the discipline of that it   put in the work it can happen it's kind   of what we're talking about with louie   louie's like   yeah i didn't start at the mercedes-benz   stadium but it was like that one act of   faith every day   and all of a sudden i i looked at the   mountain in front of me and i said move   so it's literally exactly what we just   talked about   i thought we should end it there because   that was just a present   wrap on the whole episode   whoa that's good also we have some new   let's get merch coming out and it is   legit sweatshirts we have hats coming   soon and we even   have a candle that says whoa that smells   good   so fun stuff coming if you are a big fan   of what it's a good podcast or you have   a friend

podcast because we   have an amazing human here   miss carrie jobe is in the house          welcome thank you i'm so excited yes   and i'm excited we get to do this in   person like you said it's so sweet   i feel like i need to like really   freshen up on my people skills   i know right just conversational skills   can i hug you should i   just film your hand i don't know it's   true   you have not been around people so this   is so nice well we'll   get started with the question i asked   everybody which we just talked about can   be an intimidating question you can but   what is the best piece of advice you've   ever been given   you know i i don't remember where i   heard this   it's just something that's just really   stuck with me and i think it's like   really in the fabric of my heart now   because i   the lord will even bring it up to me   when i forget about it but   it was comparison will always steal from   their creativity and calling on your own   life   it's so good and it's so true because   when we look at someone else's   life or what they're doing or what   they're called to and we compare maybe   what   we're doing and think well i'm not doing   it that way it doesn't look this way   you know i think it steals from it's   true it steals from   so what we're called to it can even   steal from you being creative   in your own right and what you know you   feel   you're supposed to be doing that's so   good that's literally like in the heart   of   liver original too like what we talk   about it's like you have to be confident   in who you were   originally created to be that's right   because if you start comparing it does   steal   and i still struggle with that sometimes   like yesterday i was at this conference   and alex seeley was there   which i love her i know y'all are so   close yes i was like   you know i've been like struggling today   because i was gonna speak and i was like   the last one   and everybody else was just like so   smart and like so factual and so like   bold and strong and i was like i don't   really talk like that   and she just started going no no no no   no no no she's like   yeah you don't talk like that and that's   not your anointing and you don't need to   try to be somebody else like it was just   like   yeah she just spoke truth straight to my   heart and so   i couldn't agree she'll do that every   time i'm like   oh thank you i want to cry and smile and   run and take over the world now but   she's she's awesome so that's so good i   love that advice um   i'm so excited to talk to you about your   new album the blessing it's like   literally went all around the world   especially the song but the album too   and   when your album came out i've had so   many friends like sending me like   this song this time oh you gotta listen   to this respect me like no joke i've had   several   friends text me just different ones from   the album and so   this is super exciting um i know this   album was different than other albums   because you had to do it   you know without a live audience you're   making me emotional oh   it's so good it's amazing but i know you   did it without a live audience   was that hard for you to like   go there in the midst of like knowing   that   this is just totally a different time   mm-hmm   the idea of doing it that way before i   stepped into the room and   felt the anointing and the team was with   me   the idea of it before i i cried my eyes   out yeah i mean i really had to   i feel like it was like grief i kind of   feel like i grieved   the worshipers not being there with me   and you know as a worship leader as a   speaker like we love to connect with the   heart of people because that's what   we're called to do and   so i was like lord how like how am i   gonna do this i won't be able to see   anyone's faces and i just feel like the   lord was like but i'll be there   well and i i'm like well of course   she'll be there   but i think sometimes we just think oh   wow you're right   and yeah that whole like idea of we we   do worship the audience of one   i just had to dig into that it's good   and you know   and i think what helped is we   we had experienced a lot of really   strong moments doing the live streams   for church   and there were no people in the room for   those yeah it's true and you you just   kind of   realize you're worshiping with your   friends on stage so you're not alone   yeah um speaking in a room alone would   be hard to me yeah   you know because you're like you can't   vibe off of anyone you're just literally   having to   follow the holy spirit but it actually   ended up being so   one of the most sacred things i've ever   wow   and now i'm like maybe i'll always do it   without the people   that's awesome i mean not that it's not   sacred when the people are there of   course it is but there's just like this   different   i just i closed my eyes most of the time   and i just was so focused on the father   and just like this conversation and all   the songs i just felt so connected   to the lord and uh even you know henry   produced it and he was like take your   time   there's wow there's no rush i didn't   have to like transition moments for   people   or you know like things you think about   as a worship leader i don't have to   worry about some of those things that's   cool it kind of made it neat that's so   cool you can hear that   like in the album it literally sounds   like you are just talking to   the father and it's so sweet and i think   that that's super encouraging for   everybody right now whether you're a   worship leader or speaker   if you're at home alone or you've felt   that isolation just that reminder like   dig   into the fact that god is there i   remember whenever   i covered and i was sick for two solid   weeks and like   you know already quarantining before   that because my family had it and so i   hadn't been around people and i had one   night where i was just like christian   um i'm gonna go sit in the car and i   need to worship   and man it was one of the most sacred   moments ever and   i actually will never forget that and i   hope i never forget that moment because   it was me like pressing past the   feelings that i've had the isolation the   loneliness and just saying like   god i know you're here i'm just gonna   keep worshiping you like   as if you are right here in the moment   and i feel great and   it was just a really cool moment so i   love how you said i had to dig in   because sometimes   you do have to dig in in the midst of   these moments that are really hard   um okay so i want to talk about the   blessing the song because   obviously it is just like it is so cool   as a friend   as a person watching from afar seeing   just that song go across the whole world   and just how it impacted people and   it was really cool so when chris and i   found out we were pregnant   that was like the first song i like   saying over like our child because i was   just like   thinking about that like in a thousand   generations and your children and their   children   and it's just so beautiful but when   y'all were in that room and writing that   song   did y'all know like the strength that   carried like the anointing that was on   it or were y'all kind of like wow this   is good we'll see   or was it more it was more the second   part like this feels really good   and special but you always want to try   it in a room   to know like oh is this going to connect   with people or is this just like   we've been here too long and we should   get some fresh air yeah   it was that night though so we had   written all day   and we were finally getting to bed it   was like one in the morning   and the elevation team stayed longer to   work on the demo   and they sent it through at like one in   the morning and so   i'm crawling into bed and cody was like   you need to listen to this grab your   air pods so i get them and i no joke i   laid in bed with just warm tears running   running down my cheeks   and i was like this feels really special   and it just felt so sweet like yeah   listening to these promises we've   believed and said   heard you know all growing up i was   raised in a christian home so i heard   the aaronic blessing a lot and just that   inner coming and you're going and you're   weeping   you know just different like blessings   of god i'd heard that   kind of stuff my whole life but in the   context of like hearing it all in one   place   with a beautiful melody with it and   i just remember thinking like this feels   really sweet yeah i can't wait to leave   and we let it the next day   for the first time and i yeah wow you   see that on the video   yes i love it we've watched it a million   times   i remember when it first came out and   chris and i were watching on youtube   i think i cried every time i listened to   it for the first like 12 times   like seriously and i remember um i don't   run   okay i'm a walker i'm not like a runner   but when i was listening to that song i   got in the treadmill   i cranked that sucker up i was like can   you go yeah like i was like   sprinting i our christians was like whoa   you were running on this like i had the   blessing   on like there's something on it that   you're right it's so exciting to hear   all those promises in one place and   and the timing of it was just perfect   for   what we were about to walk into as a   country or as a   as a world we didn't know you know and   so that's really cool   yeah um i know you're obviously a mom   of two if nobody else knew that she's a   mom and a sweet mom and   a wife to cody and i was thinking about   that like i said i was singing that over   just our child and thinking about that   and declaring that   you know in this time i feel like   there's so many   fears that come like even knowing like   we're gonna birth a child into this   world and   wow there's like a lot of bad things and   a lot of hard things   um as a mom like what gives you hope for   like your boys and like that next   generation to come in the midst of   you know a lot of trouble yeah   it's interesting you you're tying like   talking about kids   right after you talk about the blessing   because that fear   of raising kids and bringing them into   the world but also   just like the attack of the enemy on a   mom i think on a mom and dad   of like you know what could happen or   yeah   you know all these what-ifs i this is   kind of a   um a big part i think of what happened   with the blessing because   i was dealing with extreme torment and   fear with my boys   um in the first few years of being a mom   and it was something where it would be   like that you know like that nagging   in the back of your mind you just you'd   have a fearful thought and you're just   like ah   yeah but finally i got to a point where   i was like i am   so tired of constantly feeling like   something could happen and just   because my sister uh dealt with an   extreme   traumatic sorrowful experience and   that fear grips it can grip you as a mom   and so i have i've had to and i know you   you just have to take authority over   these thoughts   and what has helped me the most is just   getting the word out and just declaring   truth good declaring truth because it   says we are   our minds are renewed by the word it's   so good   and so that's been i think for a mom you   know   i think that's also what's kind of um   pent up in the blessing i think maybe   those moments where it causes   a mom to cry listening to that song is   as a mom   i had to kind of dig in with my   relationship with the lord as a mom   and just declare i'm gonna believe these   truths instead of the tormenting spirit   of fear   and um there were some nights even maybe   a year   before we wrote the blessing where in   the middle of the night i couldn't sleep   i was super fearful   silly stuff like i would go check did i   unplug the   toaster is the is there gas coming   through the   you know stuff like things were like i   just was so nervous and fearful   constantly checking and   you know and finally one night i got up   and i   just was like that's enough and and   that's a very nice way of putting it i   was   i got really fervent that night and just   began to   like i i almost woke everyone up in the   house i was   that fervent in my prayers and in my   declarations of   that's enough i'm going to believe the   things that the the word of god says   over my life and over my babies   you won't steal from me anymore that's   enough you know so   that is so good that's a long answer but   no i   i need to hear that i i just opened up   to a bible study group about this   because   i was like it's so crazy like when you   find out you're   a mom like there's so much gratitude and   then at the same like it's almost the   same moment there's so much fear   and i had a friend that had a   miscarriage and my sister had a   miscarriage and it's like you just start   to think like what if this happens what   could happen all this stuff   and i remember i was talking to somebody   and i was like i just feel like it's so   hard because you have to have so much   faith because you can't see   you like once you do and they're they're   like no once you do you'll still have   fear if you don't deal with it now like   you'll still have that fear you'll still   feel like you need to check everything   and make sure everything's okay and   every little thing will make you afraid   and so   they're like if you don't surrender that   right now like   you're gonna have to later it's gonna   keep nagging and so   that's such good advice like you need to   get serious about your fear whether it's   about a child or about just fear in   general   and what you believe about the character   of god yeah that's good   that right there was what set me free   not it's not that it set me free it's   that i've been able to overcome   those those tormenting thoughts and i   take authority over   faster and it's good and don't let them   like have a heyday in my mind   but alex is actually one of the ones   that helped me with that because   she just had she said to me one night   you need to resolve in your heart   what you believe about the character of   god well   for yourself that's so good not for   other people but   inside internally and yeah i remember   um that was a rough night for me   uh then it was just this this night that   actually   something had happened with kingston at   seven weeks old   he fell into some water wow in his   stroller   wow it was a really wild traumatic   experience at radnor lake wow   and um i rescued him he was fine   but it actually wasn't as like traumatic   as i thought it was   at first you know i was able to get him   he was fine but   um what it did for me though was like   god   i pray all the time for protection and   something still happened   and alex was like yeah things are going   to happen we live in a fallen world   we're going to experience some things we   don't understand but she's like   if you don't resolve this in your heart   now you're going to consistently deal   with this fear and torment wow   and so i remember that night she said   you need to ask him what he wants you to   believe about his character   and i remember saying to her like um i   don't i don't want to do that   and i think there was like this fear of   what if he says like   something i don't want to hear yeah and   i think people deal with that i think   i think sometimes we don't want to ask   the lord it's really good something   because it's like   what if he says something that i don't   want to have to walk through   like i have a friend who her child has   autism   she didn't want to walk through that but   in the midst of it she's watching god's   beautiful faithfulness and he's meeting   her in places she never   even realized she needed him to meet her   like those are the things where you see   like the grace of god that we don't   fully understand   and anyway well i got really quiet that   night   and i finally just said what do you want   to tell me about your character   and i just kind of waited and all i   heard him say was   you need to know that my character is   good   and it's been one of those processes of   walking that out to really fully   understand what like what do you mean by   that   yeah and i i think what he means by that   is he's just saying   he's good and he turns things for our   good   because that's all he knows how to do   well and so things that we walk through   that we don't understand we can see his   faithfulness because he's   he's just good that's he's going to turn   it for good so   so that fear element of it it really   helps because it's like okay whatever i   end up walking through   god will be there with me and his he's   good that's amazing he's faithful   you know so wow that's so good i i know   you say that with tears in your eyes and   i but people   on the other side listening have tears   in their eyes because fear is so   gripping and   i know you sing about that and and your   song no fear   and i i even wrote i was like you're   like a guide and a friend   to people on like how to not fear   and then you go beyond the how and   you're like why you should not   fear because you declare that god is   good that he is there and so   it's cool because everything you say   that's in your heart that you're like   this is what i walk through this   experience you really do feel that all   in the album it's like you   hear that truth you hear that declared   and so   if you're like i need carrie to walk   around with me and tell me   all these things every day go listen to   the album because she really does   declare that over   over you and helps you through those   moments um i wanted to ask you two and i   don't have this on my notes but   just because we keep talking about alex   i think it is really unique that you and   cody are like   really global for church leadership   and worship i mean y'all songs everybody   knows   songs both of y'all and together um but   you also like are a huge part of your   local church and like   y'all lead worship at your church like i   remember when i came   to the belonging for the first time and   you were leading and lauren was leading   and   uh natalie was leading and i was like   that is really cool   all of these people who and it wasn't   cool from like oh these people are so   cool because yes you are but   it was cool that y'all choose to stay   in that local position and pour into   this body   and you're you know leading globally and   so what is that importance to you as a   family that you're so plugged in and   even help start really the church yeah   i mean yeah we got to be there from the   beginning   i will always be a local church girl you   know that scripture that says   those who are planted in the house of   god will flourish i've just watched the   fruit of that   you know and it also says in the word to   test something by its fruit and so it's   like and   abide in me i will abide in you abide in   me as the you knows the vine and   it's like there's just so much richness   in our lives by staying   connected to godly friends community   pastoral leadership you know um i love   that that relationship with a pastor or   a leader or a mentor   can be difficult at times because it's   confronting yeah   or it's challenging yeah or it's   uncomfortable   you know but the fruit of it is always   so incredible   so you know and someone like you know   alex she's become a dear friend   you know maybe it's not a pastor in   someone's life but it's just a godly   uh someone who has a different   perspective that's good but i think it's   important that they be   very very in tune with the holy spirit   full of the word of god   it's good you know it's we can get kind   of squirrely   if you're not if we don't have that you   know those there's maybe a covering or   someone that's like   hey i see some some stuff you need to   tweak here   um or watch it like   i think you should deal with this in   your heart like that's the kind of   friendship alex and i have   that's good and it's really good and i   think   i recommend that for everyone i think   it's really sweet to just also   get to pour into people that you see on   a weekly basis   and you know the sacrifice of worship   and praise on their life   like you know the deep things going on   in their family like my friend with   an autistic child like just doing life   with people that it's just normal yep   keeps it very normal yeah and everyone   all over the world no matter where i get   to go   i feel like i can connect with them   because i have a connection with people   just it's good that we're doing life   with   right you know yeah i think that's so   important too and even just for people   who   you know i think sometimes we exchange   that for like social media relationships   that we get yeah yeah and i would just   encourage people who are listening that   you know you can have relationships on   social media and there are fun elements   to that but doing like life on life with   people and actually   having someone to say hey this is where   you might be wrong or like the lord is   really speaking this to me and let me   encourage you with this okay   i'm really walking through this like we   need that as humans and   i was talking to um louis giglio about   like what makes somebody like a good   leader like someone that you like   would you know want to speak at your   conferences or want to invite   and he's like i always look to see if   they're like plugged into their local   church and if they have a church family   around them   amazing i think that's really good like   even just to hear from somebody like him   that   that is really important to him that he   sees leaders surrounded by church   families and like   because then he knows that you're not   getting squirrel you're not just running   off and thinking   everything you do is right and so yeah i   think for everybody listening like that   is just good advice period no matter who   you are or where you're at like you   being surrounded by a church family or a   mentor or a friend or somebody who   is in tune with the holy spirit is so   important   um i love the song heaven invade on your   album and i was thinking about this   because you you talk about that moment   where you're in worship and you just   kind of like   feel like heaven just enter the room and   when you said something about the wind   and i thought about passion   whenever this moment happened i remember   seeing you backstage and you were like   i thought that the lord was there like   the wind came out of nowhere i did see   you guys like right after   you're like so shook and then i heard   that   they actually weren't they had tried to   get that thing to open   and they told them no and then it just   randomly   really randomly opened in that moment so   it really was a god thing   it really was so cool and so i wanted   you to   speak to that to the people who have   never had an experience like that who   have like never   felt or maybe even been in a worship   service you know we might have people   who are like   i actually go to church i don't know   what this whole thing's about um when we   talk about a moment where you just kind   of feel   heaven touch earth we just kind of feel   the presence of god what does that feel   like as a leader   in a room where you're like whoa it   feels like the lord is here and what   changes in the room   oh man this is a loaded question i know   it kind of is it's good no it's good   though   what changes in the room you know we are   spiritual beings   so everyone listening even if you don't   have a relationship with the lord   you have felt some kind of spiritual   experience   somewhere somehow and we're wired   to to worship like if we don't worship   the lord and   and his goodness we will worship things   you know whether it's fashion or food or   you know it's like we are just wired for   worship we're wired for adoration we're   wired for   so when you're in a room and the   presence of god comes in   i mean i've never heard someone not say   that their arm   hair didn't stand up and like they got   our bodies are just   we're we're wired for the eternal so   we're wired for the supernatural yeah   and so   it's fun as a leader when you when you   pray bold prayers   another thing that was so wild and   beautiful about that experience of the   the roof opening at passion was   we had just prayed backstage god i pray   and and the presence of god was already   moving and there was so many incredible   things going on in that room   already so but i felt like praying god i   just pray that kids that   haven't experienced you tangibly yet wow   that you would blow through the room   like a mighty wind   and that they would feel you even on   their faces   wow and so when the roof open in that   building   it it has like a um world   a whirlwind effect so it literally like   kind of does this like circular air   thing because the way that it opens so   the air comes in and starts to do a   circle   so it felt like it's a whirlwind of his   presence   filled the room you know so i think i   think   you could ask daring prayers yeah you   can say i want you to reveal yourself to   me   that's cool because he does he will yeah   you know oh i love   that especially when you're asking in   faith not   not god prove yourself to me but god   show me something about you that's   tangible and real   yep i'll promise you he'll do it that is   so cool   i feel like you know skeptical people   would say something like   well but it is the the the room did just   open so it's not really the lord and   kristin kane said this she said you know   what all i have to say to you if you   think these are coincidences and she   says the more i pray the more bizarre   things happen   it's true that's all i have to say   and so it doesn't hurt to have faith and   when you start to see god moving your   life   in tangible ways like healing someone or   setting someone free from an addiction   you know and it's a super   natural thing yeah then you start to go   wow   okay god i see that you're you're real   it's   working yeah it's amazing it's fun um   last thing i want to ask you is   your song uh first love i think it's so   beautiful   and uh it's so special so i'd love for   you to talk about that but   also i just love that you just declare   you're still my first love you're still   my only one   what is the importance of those words to   you and that   that declaration that you wrote this   song to just   almost like reposition your heart back   to like   your first love like i don't know i just   wanted you to unpack that song because i   think it's so beautiful   and it really connects with me and i   think really probably everybody   especially in this time where   you kind of do need to go back to that   first initial love and those feelings   that you have when you   fell in love with the father or realized   he was in love with you   yes all that um it's   it's one of my favorite songs i've ever   been a part of writing   and i from beginning to end like from   beginning   we took communion the morning that we   wrote that song and   we spent like two hours on our faces   after that just   pouring our hearts out with the lord i   was with stephanie gretzinger and alyssa   smith   and a dear friend and my drummer that's   been with me for years she's like my   brother and   those girls really cultivate   and have just like carried such an   anointing to just   like be such good friends with jesus and   and i love that too i   that's my favorite thing about knowing   the lord is that we're invited into   friendship   it's cool relationship yeah and so um   that song comes out of revelation 2   where where   the lord is addressing one of the   churches in revelation and he's like i   know the things that you love and the   things that you hate   but i do have one thing against you that   you've left your first love   wow and then he says go back and do the   things you did at first   and if you don't i will remove my   lampstand from its place which   represents his presence   i will remove my presence   and i mean   the idea of him removing his presence   from our life that would be one of the   scariest things   it would be the scariest thing because i   i just live my life   based on what is your presence are you   in this with me   are you what are you saying what i want   to hear your voice and   so for him to give a challenge and a   declarative thing of   this is how you need to live your life   you need to seek me first   stay in love with me not just keep me   first but stay   in love yeah stay in love good   not know about love not talk about love   and you know to be in love you know for   me to be   in love with cody takes um   being intentional yeah takes like date   nights and   being creative and not just like   printing something off   of the computer that someone else says   about somebody but like   writing it with my own handwriting yeah   and like staying with the lord   it's good and i think a lot of times we   will   we will go to church on a sunday morning   we'll sing someone else's song   we'll hear someone else's sermon and we   think that we've said everything we   should say to the lord   but having relationship is   god i want i want you to be my first   love and   um not that i had fallen out of love   with the lord but i think sometimes just   the   the mundane routine of life we can   we can just get to a place where it's   like gotten stagnant   you know you're still um in your   honeymoon phase   cutting with you and christian and i'm   about to celebrate   six years of marriage and you know   there's just these ebbs and flows that   you begin to get into which you're   seeing even now like yeah   there's days where you're like i think   i'm just gonna go for a walk like by   myself   you know like you just there's these   ebbs and flows of relationship   and um sorry this is a very long answer   oh i love it   i just love the aspect that the lord   invites us into true   friendship it's good to stay in love and   it's so good there's so much that he   wants to do in our lives but he wants to   do it because   there's deep friendship yup you know   that is so good i can relate to that i   think especially in this year because   i didn't even realize that i had gotten   into a pattern of like i was always at   churches i was always at conferences   there's always that things and   i love listening to other people so i'm   taking everything everybody else is   saying and   worshiping and i love it and then   whenever church is closed i was like   yeah like i'm so like i love you god   like   you know i just started to realize i'm   praying the same   prayers like every single day like i'm   getting like   really in the routine of things and i   wasn't reading as much as i should i   wasn't pursuing as much as i should i   was almost   waiting for church to open back up   instead of like opening up my bible   opening up my heart   opening up my life like like you said   like not taking what somebody else said   by actually writing it with your own   handwriting like that's so beautiful and   that's so true and so   staying in love is is it does take   intentionality and i've been challenged   by that   myself during covert and i'm one to like   i i love to pursue the lord and   you know this has really even hit me in   this time pretty heavy and so   i know for people who ask me questions   like how do you say   you know in the routine of you know this   or that or reading or praying and i   think it's like   forget the routine as much as it's just   staying in love like say in love   all of that will will kind of help your   routine and in relationship and so   that's so good i mean if you didn't   already love carrie you really love her   now   and if you haven't listened to the   blessing go listen to it but also listen   to it   and i think even hearing these answers   that she truly prays over these songs   that she writes like they come from a   really real place and so   um she took communion the day she wrote   those songs and so   they really are a um i think a   collaboration of prayer   and friendship and heartbreak and   speaking for what the lord has mended   and so   i think the album's beautiful i think   you're beautiful and thank you so much   for sharing all of your incredible   advice   thank you love you love you friend          all right fam let's go over some good   and bad advice y'all   just so you don't forget we get all of   our good and bad advice from the woe   that's good podcast   instagram dms and our ella sister app so   be a part of the podcast by sending in   your good and bad advice for some   entertainment   all right baby you ready i'm ready all   right wind extinguishes a candle   but energizes a fire great advice   did you say that i said that question   then you sent that in yeah i did   i was deploying did you say that i was   the plug for that one yeah that wasn't a   book i read um   i can't remember what book it was though   but yeah i thought i thought it had so   much application like literally but also   like spiritually just the idea of like   i mean if i'm going to isolate myself   whether it's the wind of the world or   whatever that looks like it's going to   be quickly extinguished   extinguishable if it's by myself but if   i surround myself with the community of   people then   i think the lord's going to send that   out that's so good i love that it's like   people you know say after they go to a   conference or something like   oh i was on a spiritual high and then   like i lost it and i think that's   because like   they go back from a conference and they   try to just like keep it going   the fan like fan the flame of just like   a candle   and wind will actually take that out   instead of like going back and like   joining a church body or joining a group   of friends who believe the same thing   and then the wind goes the fire gets   crazy there you go then you gotta fire   get a wildfire   all right live in the moment   it's good that's good yeah i think what   are you thinking   you don't think it's good no because   because sometimes like   sometimes little things like that can be   kind of they can be kind of   counterintuitive   they can be like big words on the   surface on the surface   you want to think good about get it good   but then you think a little deeper about   it then it's like   i think it is good advice because i   think if you start living too much in   the past   or in the future yeah well as you say if   you start living too much in the past   then you don't like continue to grow if   you start   living too much in the future you   probably have anxiety   yeah so that's why it's called the   present yes live in the moment   ah hey that was good well that was good   i i didn't just come up with that oh you   didn't no i wish it   if i did i would be making a lot of   money right now yeah   all right see rejection as protection   see these these little singers they're   getting me these little zingers   yeah that one is hard because rejection   hurts yeah but a lot of times it is for   you   a lot of times it is it is like an   accountability but i think sometimes   people   you know that can be pointed   at like an envy or like a jealousy it's   like wanting to   reject something if if i'm not on your   team   you know i could reject you but it's not   for my protectionist because i   don't want you to do that or i'm envious   of you i would have never thought like   that   well that did that's why i swear that's   why i thought like it was a zinger   all right so if you sent me that   question i don't know what you were   thinking but   a friend rejection yes i think it could   be for your help but if it's someone   that you don't really trust and   i'd be cautious that's good yeah   that is good that was a really deep   thought i feel like we could have talked   about that for longer but we must   continue   it's the thought that counts   um i think it's a thought that counts   but sometimes you're like okay bro   yeah well my first thought was like   my first thought about that thought was   like if i get you like a gift or   something it's like oh it's the thought   that counts   um but sometimes   sometimes i think you can use that as   like a cop out   that's what i was saying like sometimes   like that's a continual thing it's like   okay you've said it's a thought that   counts like 12 times it's trying to not   be there   because i can look at my own life and i   think like sometimes like if we   if we're like talking about something i   can use that as i could being like   defensive   like oh it's the thought that counts so   you should just be grateful with that   that's true   you have done that you've done that   numerous times but there i didn't send   into that question   but there are moments where it really is   a thought that counts like our wedding   gift like your wedding gift to me   so i like had these i had like been   saying on one of these slides for like   on i actually   just randomly said one just oh i love   those slides i want some of those slides   and then one of my wedding gifts was the   slides and i had said it a long time ago   but i didn't even think that you   remembered but they were like two sizes   too small   so like that   that was nordstrom no offense we do love   you if you want to sponsor us come back   but no we i ordered like a nine it was   like a   six or six   anyways he really was about the cows   because i was like so impressed with you   that you remembered that i said that   i know you're a size eight but then you   did order those shoes and they were   seven and a half   thank you you said nine just   keep the questions going okay   this is a good this is a really good   thought if you can't afford virtual   virtual reality headsets you can close   your eyes and imagine   everything you want um   i think that's true i think what i don't   know if that's true   it's not true because some of those   things are like actually pretty legit   like   it you're like i don't own one but i've   like been to best buy and i've kind of   put them on before   and they're pretty cool but i think   sometimes by   use by that being your first option   sometimes we lose our creativeness   oh that's good i think like when i was   younger like   i would much rather like be imaginative   with like my brother than like going to   put on like going like isolate myself in   a room   and just putting on i do hope that   virtual reality   doesn't take away from our imagination   and creativity like you know because   sometimes whenever no i hope it doesn't   like i'm saying it   it could like because sometimes whenever   you have a better   experience than the experience that you   had even though it was good like okay   for instance   six flights is awesome then you go to   disney world and you're like six flags   is still   great but disney world is amazing you   know disney world more than certain no   because actually   wow it's disney so it's like wow virtual   reality and you're like oh my   imagination   i hope we don't get to that point   because your imagination is way more   creative and your imagination   is going to actually create things that   the world needs not   virtual reality yeah but hey it is cool   yeah good time if you're listening to   this and you work at disney we love   disney would love to come in there   and i also went to six bucks for like   four of my birthdays also love sex flags   okay we

incredible couple who went   through a really hard time but   god has just walked through her through   some painful situations and just   redeemed so many things in her   life that really seemed unredeemable and   that really seemed   even impossible to her she would have   said um but   man god was so faithful god was so good   and she took the time to dive into god's   word and take him out his word   to see a good ending and so i can't wait   for you guys to hear her story it's   gonna be incredible   let's call lisa          lisa i am so glad you were on this   podcast and you are one that i'm very   excited to ask   the whoa that's good question too what   is the best piece of advice that you've   ever been given   well sadie thank you for that it's   actually a bible verse i don't know if   very many people   give you bible verses but don't i love   yes   so a long time ago before   i was really even living a christian   life   i came across a bible verse it's matthew   5 8   blessed are the pure in heart for they   shall see god   and i remember reading that verse and i   remember thinking   that sounds ridiculous because   you can't see god and if i could see god   i wouldn't struggle so much with having   faith but over the years i started to   recognize that   blessed is that person who desires   to see evidence of god's goodness   and faithfulness in their life and when   you desire to see   god's goodness and faithfulness and   god's hand of activity in your life   then you do start to see god wow   and so i don't live it out perfectly   but i try to remember when i wake up in   the morning   and i pray when i get up from my prayers   i try to remember i just invited the   divine presence of god almighty to do   life with me that day   and then i look for his hand of activity   and it set my heart on such an adventure   of truly learning how to see god wow   that is   so good i love that i you know those   bible verses that i mean i know i've   read it before but it's never jumped at   me like that   that is so powerful and it's so cool too   because   normally every time somebody gives me   their best piece of advice you can see   it play out in their life   and for you even reading this book like   you   do see god and like everything and you   even talk about how sometimes that's   that's   a struggle because you want to like   write the story of god before he writes   it   but i think it comes from that place of   desiring to see   the goodness of god in your story and   that that's so beautiful   um so i can't wait to dive into   just this book and this message that you   talk about i   just shared with you before we got on   that it truly was   so impacting from my own life and just   reading it to interview you was   something that ended up blessing me more   than i would have ever imagined it would   have but   it's called forgiving what you can't   forget is obviously about your life   story   someone to ask you first of all   forgiveness is obviously   really a hard thing to do it's something   that a lot of people struggle to do and   then   to write a book about it it would be   extra challenging i   i know about the book writing process   and even that in itself is challenging   and so   what you know made you choose the path   of forgiveness which i know is a huge   question to start with   and then how did you choose to write   about it   that's such a good question sadie i have   to say this   message of forgiveness chose me and kind   of chased me down   and i remember one of the early writing   days   my team showed up and they were ready to   hear   some chapters that i'd written and i had   not   written the chapters that i needed to   write because   as i started to sit down and put pen to   paper   i felt so much resistance in my heart   and so instead of writing good helpful   chapters i started making lists of all   the reasons why   forgiveness was impossible and i listed   out things   like well the other person hasn't said   they're sorry   and i don't know if i'm done hurting   over this   and if i forgive this then that isn't   that me saying that what happened   doesn't matter and it very much does   matter   is forgiveness me betraying my own   feelings   is it me saying that you know i wasn't   really hurt   when the hurt that has been unleashed in   my life   is not just something i suffered one day   but i'm still suffering because of it   every day since and then when what   happened   is unchangeable is it even forgivable   and i had this misunderstanding   that i thought the bible said that in   order to forgive you have to forget   but you know i couldn't forget and so   therefore i felt like i couldn't forgive   so what we decided to do is instead of   me   writing on forgiveness first we decided   to hit the pause button   on the book and i studied what the bible   actually says and doesn't say about   forgiveness and we spent over a   thousand hours studying well   and as i studied about forgiveness   i started to understand where things   were falling apart for me   i had a very young immature   understanding of forgiveness i really   had a little girl understanding of   forgiveness that i was trying to take   into my very adult world   you see when i was a little girl my mom   whenever i would do something   to my sister now sadie i know you've   never done anything to bella ever   never   [Laughter]   but i i had a tendency as the older   sister   to you know be mean sometimes to my   younger sister and then she would cry my   mom the great judge would appear   and she would look at me and she would   say lisa say you're sorry it was wrong   for you to hit your sister   and then very authentically i would say   i'm sorry   that's she would look at my sister and   say now you need   to say you forgive lisa she understands   hitting is wrong she's not going to do   it again so say you forgive her so my   sister would say she forgave me and then   my mom would say now the two of you need   to hug and make up and if you don't stop   acting foolish i'm really going to give   you something to cry about   and that was a good lesson on   forgiveness however   i never let my little girl understanding   of forgiveness grow   up and when i face some very adult   situations   forgiveness fell apart because i kept   waiting for the other person to say they   were sorry i kept waiting for the great   judge to appear to declare that i was   right and they were wrong   and i kept waiting that i felt like the   other person needed to learn   all the lessons of why they shouldn't   have done this so that they wouldn't   then hurt me again or hurt other people   and so i started to   understand as i got into this thousand   hours of studying the bible and   forgiveness that i had a   wrong understanding of forgiveness and   it changed   my life wow that is so powerful and   it's really cool to hear like from start   to   i guess you know beginning of writing   this book that   that's the process because all the   questions you were saying   as to why you couldn't write the book   from just reading the book   it was really all the questions that   were answered from a biblical standpoint   and so to know   that that was where you started like   this is impossible because of this   but then you took god at his word and   read the word   thinking it said forgive and forget   because we hear that all the time but it   really says something completely   different   is is so huge and i think a lot of times   you know people   don't know what the bible says but they   think they do   so they just assume what it says because   they've heard a really good quote that   sounded like it was a scripture   and they go with that but it's not you   know based off of truth sometimes and so   that's where they get a little bit led   astray and so   i think that is one encouragement to   everybody listening to that   you know if you're struggling with   something if it seems impossible the   word of god says like all things are   possible through him who gives us   strength and so   to take it to his word and find strength   from his word   is so powerful in this book that's the   whole book i mean you unpack the bible   so beautifully   christian was sitting beside me and i   just kept saying   dang and i was like listen to this i   mean i read in so many parts   that some of the revelation you pulled   out just from the bible was   was huge um something that i love that   you said is you said god is not a do   nothing god   and a lot of people i do think say that   why is god not doing anything and   especially a year like this why is he   not doing anything where   is he but you claim god is not a do   nothing god   where does that come from for you well i   was at a speaking engagement   one time and i was sharing my story and   part of my   story that you know i i don't get into   all the detail of my story   in the book but you know about   what i was facing as you walk through   the book and   and you follow along the narrative of   what i was experiencing in my life but   part of it   is that i found out my husband was being   unfaithful   and it was so shattering and so shocking   i held it private for 18 months because   i didn't want to invite public opinion   into our very private pain   but after 18 months i um   i thought we were about to cross the   finish line and and be reconciled and   then everything fell apart again   and our story was not a neat and tidy   story of discovery   and then repentance and then   reconciliation it was a very   long drawn out hard process   and there were so many times in the   journey where i felt like   it was going to be impossible for   reconciliation to happen   and a big point that i make in the book   is that   you know just because we experience   forgiveness forgiveness is a command by   god but reconciliation is very dependent   on you know whether it's safe and   whether two people are willing to do the   hard work to come together so i was   sharing some of that out of speaking   engagement   and a lady raised her hand and she was   also   in a very devastating place in her   marriage   and she said i just don't understand why   god is doing   nothing and sadie i understood   where that question was coming from   because i knew what it felt like   art didn't live in my home for two and a   half   years so i went from having five   kids and a full family life to   all of the kids growing up and moving   out and when my last   child moved out so did my husband so   i was utterly alone when for my whole   adult life i'd been   so so like my house had been full of so   much life   and it was so hard and i knew what it   felt like to wake up at two o'clock in   the morning terrified   alone and having to realize all over   again   that my husband wasn't home and you know   and it was just   it was just brutal so i knew where this   lady's question was coming from   right but i also knew that   just because we wake up every day and we   see certain realities in the physical   that's not the full story everything   that we   see with our physical eyes is what we   are experiencing   here and now but at the same time   god is always operating in the spiritual   and we may not see it but we don't have   to see it to believe   that he is doing something i combed the   pages of scripture   and i realized with god there's always a   meanwhile   there's always what we're experiencing   and at the same time there's what god is   doing   and here's where i get in trouble and   you mentioned this just a minute ago   i love to say you know with god all   things are possible   and then i love to look at a hard   situation in my life   and run ahead of god and write out the   script   of all the good and all the possible   that god should do   i want to hold god accountable to my   version of good   yeah and when god doesn't follow after   my script   i can wrongly assume he's doing nothing   when in reality he's very much doing   something   it just wasn't the something i expected   but here's the good news sadie   that god knows better than we   know here i am on the other side of this   journey with art   and through a series of just   crazy miracles god did bring us back   together   but god never listened to one of my   suggestions   he never followed after my plan because   my suggestions to god could have only   caused change behavior and art and god   was after rescuing his soul   so he did it differently but he never   was doing nothing he was always doing   something   i just couldn't see it but we have to   know   god does his best work in the unseen   that is so good come on somebody needs   to rewind that   about 30 seconds and listen to that   whole thing again   that's so powerful i quoted this from   the book because i thought this quote   was so good and it's what you were just   talking about it says   you can't edit reality to try to force   healing   and that's kind of why you were talking   about the whole i sometimes   want to play out all the things that god   could do that would make this possible   that would make this good and i think   sometimes even in just our   instagram blog world you know we do that   we want to edit things to make it sound   better or look better but   you really walked out the process of   healing and forgiveness   and i wanted to ask you this question   that you really laid out in the book and   i this was something that really was a   pivotal moment for me as i was reading   because   you talk about just the hurt that you're   going through but at the same time the   forgiveness that you were giving and so   i think a lot of people might have this   question too like can you forgive   someone   and that thing that they did still hurt   you   you know sadie that is such an excellent   question because   i think we've wrongly understood that   once we forgive   all the hard feelings go away and   you know just because we forgive doesn't   mean   that we've then attended to all the   emotional healing that needs to take   place   because forgiveness   is both a decision and a process   so we make the decision to forgive and   sometimes our feelings have   haven't even signed on for that decision   yet   but we don't do it by overwriting our   feelings because forgiveness is   not based on our determination   forgiveness   is our cooperation with what god is   doing   so as god's forgiveness flows to us   we make the decision to forgive by   letting god's forgiveness that flowed to   us flow   through us and so   we have to understand that that   forgiveness   is a decision and a process we forgive   for the facts of what happened   that happens in a moment in time in   obedience with god   but then we walk through the process of   forgiving   for the impact that that had on us   that process of forgiveness is where we   tend   all of the emotions and the emotional   debt created   and if somebody causes you a five dollar   hurt then it the process of forgiveness   will probably be pretty short but if   someone causes you a five   million dollar debt emotional debt of   hurt in your life   that process could take a lifetime so   what my counselor helped me see and i   i also in addition to studying the what   the bible says about forgiveness for   a thousand hours i i did so   much counseling i had to do a lot of   counseling but   what my counselor helped me see is that   i used to get so aggravated because i   would forgive someone   and then a month later i would be   driving down the road i would get   triggered   in pain and then i would be angry and   bitter and frustrated all over again and   then i would feel like a forgiveness   failure   so i don't know if that's ever happened   to you oh yeah for sure   but you know and triggers are very   inconvenient   triggers are very inconvenient because   you can't time them   so you know if i could say on tuesday   night at 7 00 p.m   i'll be sitting in my bathtub that would   be a great time to have   a moment a triggered moment where i have   to process something emotionally   but that's not the way it happens it   happens like in the middle of everyday   life i mean i'll be   five minutes from getting on stage to do   a message and suddenly something happens   somebody says something i see something   and i get triggered in pain and it's so   inconvenient but what i've come to   understand   is that that is not an act of cruelty by   god that we can't forget   the ways that we've been hurt the hurt   stays   as long as it needs to be tended to   and when we get triggered in pain that's   just a reminder by god there's more hurt   that's sitting in our heart   and we can have another marked moment of   forgiveness   i forgave them for the fact of what   happened but now i must forgive this   person for the   impact that this had on me and i always   add this little statement at the end   and whatever my feelings will not yet   allow for   the blood of jesus will surely cover it   because like i said you know sometimes   our feelings won't sign up for this   right but that's where we cooperate with   this gift of forgiveness that god allows   wow and so powerful it's such a good way   to say and what my feelings   you know won't allow i know that the   blood of jesus will cover i actually   quoted this too that i love from your   book it says hurt feelings don't want to   cooperate sometimes with holy   instructions   and that's so true but allowing god to   come into that those hurt feelings you   know   to forgive is so powerful you had   a crazy physical experience too   physically painful experience in the   midst of this emotionally painful   experience   i know with your colon and even with   cancer and just several different things   but   something that i really stuck out to me   was just the revelation that you kind of   got about pain that the pain is actually   what saved you   in that experience can you kind of share   that story because i think   even though it is so hard and it's even   unimaginable   to when you read the book it's like how   did all this happen   but what god showed you in that was   huge sure thing so   you know when we have hurt that's   sitting in   inside of us hurt that goes unattended   too   long and it just sits inside of us too   long will eventually turn   into hate bitterness   you know just huge traumatic   emotions and i read a book one time   that said the body keeps the score and   that really does happen   when we have all of this emotional   trauma that sits inside of us   it can really cause a lot of physical   damage as well and that's exactly what   happened to me   i woke up about six months into this   journey i woke up one morning   and i went to step out of bed and   collapsed beside my bed i was in   so much pain and i couldn't even stand   up   so i yelled from someone in my family to   come   and help me they rushed me to the   hospital the doctors   hooked me up to an iv to try to get the   pain under control right away and   started giving me pain medication but   nothing was helping so they decided   because i was in so much pain to admit   me to the hospital   they were running tests but all the   tests were coming back that i was okay   so i laid in that bed in excruciating   pain   monday tuesday wednesday thursday well   finally on friday morning a doctor came   in and said lisa we ran   one last test and we finally figured out   what was happening to you   your colon has detached from the   abdominal wall   it's twisted around itself and cut the   blood flow off inside of you   and we're gonna have to go in and remove   most of your colon   and then he said something to me that   shed so much light   on this struggle i was having i had been   struggling   so much thinking god where are you   why aren't you taking away this pain if   i had a child that was in this much pain   and i had the ability to take away their   pain i would   so why aren't you doing that god and   that's what i've been struggling with   that whole week but that doctor   right before he left to go to the or to   prep for surgery   he turned around he looked at me and he   said lisa i know that you have been   asking god to take away your pain   but i'm just telling you that if god   would have done that   then you would have gone home we would   have sent you home the only reason we   kept you here in the hospital is because   you were in so much pain the only reason   we kept running tests is because you're   in so much pain   and if god would have taken away the   pain we would have sent you home your   colon would have ruptured and you would   have died   wow and so i realized   in that moment that god loves us   too much to answer our prayers at any   other time than the right time   and in any other way than the right way   we just have to trust when we are   walking through   pain we can't try to figure out   as we navigate our pain is god good   we have to state at the very beginning   of our journey   i know my god is good my god   is good to me and my god is good   at being god therefore i can filter   everything i'm facing through that truth   and i won't get lost   wow that is so powerful that's so good i   need to do that in my own life   um that's amazing when you talk about   in the book about forgiving god um   that's something that looks like such a   shocking sentence to me i feel like   um what is that what does that look like   to forgive god what does that mean to   you   well sadie i know it is kind of shocking   because   you know you think well god's never   sinned so   god you know do we have to forgive god   and the reason i titled the chapter   forgiving god   is because i think that's where a lot of   people are when they go through   something hard   and we know that our god is big and as   strong and   as powerful and as mighty and   all-capable   and so when god doesn't do what we think   he should do   or when god allows something and we   cannot possibly   understand why god would allow this   we can not only feel hurt toward the   person that hurt us but we can feel   hurt that god didn't prevent this from   happening   yeah i don't know if you've ever had a   situation like that in your life sure   yeah   and it's hard you know it's really   really hard   so what i had to do is   go through this process of do i need to   forgive god you know i have some   i have some really hard feelings i that   really it's it's all around me not   understanding god   and me not understanding why if god saw   that this was happening   why didn't he stop it and so   in the chapter i really take people   through a process   of understanding it's not that we   need to forgive god god doesn't need to   be forgiven   but we do need to process our hurt   around what god allowed and at the end   of the day   it really takes us on a journey of   understanding that god does   have good in mind but he   also is a god that allows us to walk   through   things that don't feel good or seem good   as we are on our journey with him and   that's where faith comes in   and that's where trust comes in and   i can look back now sadie and i can   see so much more clearly what god was   allowing and i kept asking god bring art   home   but god loved me too   much to bring art home before   god rescued his soul wow and i kept   saying just bring him home just bring   him home   and i think god loved me too much to   bring a broken   version of art home that would have   betrayed me and hurt me   again art did bring i mean god did bring   art home   but it wasn't until until god had really   done some work on   art that art became the man that loves   me   the way that god wanted me to be loved   that's so   powerful that's beautiful um and even   just seeing i know i got to see you in   art recently and   it's so amazing to see all together and   just   the strength that you two have in one   another now   again and probably even a new found   strength   um i wanted to ask you this last thing   because there is a shift in y'all's   relationship and y'all's even just the   whole process   of uh getting back together and you talk   about that shift being the vulnerability   that you shared and there is also a   shift in the communication   going from shameful things to hopeful   things shameful words to hopeful words   um and so what what does that look like   for what do they look like for y'all and   then for other people going through   maybe a similar situation how do you   shift from speaking words of shame   to really breathing words of hope and   life over   each other well good question sadie   i um you know i want to also state   that sometimes forgiveness includes   reconciliation   and sometimes it doesn't but god's   redemption   is there no matter whether we experience   reconciliation in our human   relationships or not   and because of god's redemption and the   redemptive work that god does in our   life   we can change the way that we speak   about situations   and that we speak to people and so   i had to let god show me before i ever   knew if art and i were going to be   reconciled or not i had to let god   show me how do i pursue redemption god   so that i don't always tell this story   proving how hurt i was but i want to   exchange that proof of hurt   for wisdom and perspective that can help   other people   and one day i was studying in genesis   and if you've ever   spent time with me sitting around   studying the bible you know i go back to   genesis just about every time i study   the bible   but i was reading in genesis 1   and 2 and then even genesis 3 and   suddenly it occurred to me that when   when god said it is not good for the man   to be alone   so he created a suitable helper for the   man   what in the world am i supposed to help   with what does that mean   suitable helper and when i studied that   it means that the   woman is in full view of the man   and she is reflecting back to the man   almost as a reminder to him and as i   started to   think about that i was like well what am   i supposed to remind him of   and as i looked at the story sadie i   realized   man was made from dust now think about   this   dust is something that we brush away we   brush aside we don't give very much   thought to   right we just clean it up and move on   and yet god breathed   his very own breath into this seemingly   insignificant dust and   and out of it created man so man   is not just dust he's also breath of god   wow and and i think as women   we are supposed to speak that over   these men in our lives whether it's our   fathers our brothers   our husbands you know can you imagine if   we could look at them   and say you're not just a sum total of   the mistakes that you've made   that equals shame but you are also   breath of god created by god to be a   reflection   of goodness and glory of god and you're   supposed to   shine that out everywhere you go and yes   you've made some mistakes   that points to the dust reality of you   you are also breath of god and so if i   speak that over them then imagine   the man then reflecting back to the   woman   you're not just broken off bone you know   when we see a carcass on the side of the   road and i know some people   take that those things home and decorate   with them and i get that   but for the most part when we see dead   decaying bone   we don't think it's a treasure what do   we want to do we want to   bury it but a woman is not just broken   off   bone meant to be buried a woman is also   touch of god design of god hand   made by god and say can you imagine if   we could   stop the echoes of shame that are   hindering people   all over the world and if we decided to   participate in the divine echo   speaking life over one another   telling these guys of ours you're not   just dust but you   are the breath of god and then them   echoing back to us   you're not just broken off bone but you   are the touch and design of god   and this divine echo would change   all come on yes that is so   good i'm like getting so excited over   here   it's crazy like i mean reading the book   and then hearing you talk this message   is just   in you like i like sitting here about   start clapping when you started talking   because like she's going there like   every part of the book that i just   loved is just flowing out of you because   it's in your heart   like the bible talks about their good   treasures stored up in the good man's   heart and it's it's just so   in you and so lisa thank you for the a   thousand hours   thank you for the wisdom that you uh   poured in to be able to pour out and for   just going   to counseling and just staying in   the marriage and human arts   reconciliation i know you said that   doesn't happen for everybody and that's   true and there's so much   hope in this book even for that story if   that plays out in your life but   for y'all's reconciliation it's been a   beautiful thing to   watch and to read about and to   and it's powerful and so thank you for   just who you are for your whole family   you guys are   amazing and doing such incredible things   and we're so   so thankful to be you guys friend well   thank you sadie i feel the same way   about you   and i um i pray many many blessings over   you   i think sadie the person i just   described who is committed to speaking   out the divine echo   i think you are one of the strongest   voices of that and i am   so proud of how you speak truth and life   over your generation   oh thank you that that's like the best   compliment i could get   thank you so much i appreciate that   welcome back to the one that's good   podcast   we practice that way too much only one   time actually yeah   the letter for you all right we are   reading the good and bad advice sent to   us by the world let's get podcast   instagram account thank you to everyone   who follows along and sends in good and   bad advice   it keeps us very entertaining and no   advice and no advice   no we don't we kind of do as a human i   guess   okay no we appreciate all of you thank   you for sending good about advice here   is what we got   question everything very simple question   every question everything   um i don't think that's good i don't   think that's good enough   i don't get in what context it's like   well they okay from a questioner   i get you okay because i question i do   question most everything   i don't think that's good though i think   at some point you have to just trust god   and begin to trust people but i think   there is wisdom to questioning some   things you know i think some people   naively jump into things   before they thought about it or they   asked questions and   questions can save you from a lot of   trouble later you know asking questions   up front can save you from questions you   would have found out months later from   people   um so i think it's good to ask questions   but not if it's in a   like untrustful um   almost like i i don't i don't trust you   somebody to question everything every   question every move i don't trust   anybody the government's not to get me   like   you might not want to take it that far   yeah yeah and i think i think definitely   discernment can kind of coincide with   questioning and i actually heard   something this morning   it was a quote by spurgeon and it said   um discernment is not necessarily the   difference between right and wrong it's   the difference between right and almost   right   whoa that's good yeah i was like that's   really that's really perfect that's   really good i like that a lot all right   just   live a little is that a kenny chesney   song   is   i might you know you might hit a talent   i can harmonize i just can't sing   but just live a little um   i may type one on the enneagram so in   health i go to a seven which means   kind of the uh adventure adventurous yes   you always help me with that   um so just live a little i think that   it's not bad advice necessarily but i do   think you know if   if if it goes into the idea of like just   live a little have some fun   go live and sin then i think it's   horrible advice yeah   because a little normally turns into a   lot um but yeah it can be good   everything is good normally in context   you know like you can make that   a good thing like for somebody like   christian who at times can be very like   this is what we're gonna do this is the   way it's gonna be done like sometimes   it's like you know what just a little   let's just go for it let's just have a   good time yeah   there's somebody like hey just a little   come to this party   come just have a drink like that is just   like starting a conversation with the   enemy you know   horrible advice don't listen to that   person okay become the person   you're looking wait   the kind of person you're looking for is   looking for   that's a tongue twister become the   person become the person you're   looking for is looking for so i think   like   become like become the person that   who i'm looking for is looking for so i   want to become a man   oh that's good that's good i like that a   lot yeah i actually think that um   mike todd's relationship series which we   listened to before we did it   talks about like before the person and   like preparing yourself   to be the person who you're gonna be in   a relationship before you enter a   relationship   and that was great advice because i feel   like by the time christian and i met   like obviously didn't have it all   figured out and obviously we walked   through a lot   but i was like prepared to enter the   relationship that we were going to enter   because i was like confident who i was i   had like the job that i   knew i wanted to do i like knew the type   of person i wanted to marry and so i had   like a   guidance of like life and who it was   going for   instead of just like floating around   thinking like oh i hope prince charming   like lands on my doorstep one day you   know   there is like a preparation there yeah   yeah and i think i think when you come   to terms with who you are and who's got   who who god has called you to be i think   you're able to walk in that confidence   and   the person who's looking for a person   like you then you can you can be   confident   yeah that's great all right last   question focus on discipline before   desire that's good advice um   i know for me a few years ago when i   first started kind of following jesus   that   um i definitely desired him but it was   only as   as well as the prac like the practical   points that i made to to read or to to   pray   to to want to um you know go to prayer   things go to attend church and do these   things with bible study and   over time that discipline really   cultivated my desire   yeah i even think about that even with   like social media like honestly i have   the bible app on my phone   and like you don't always like want to   click on your bible app like you just   want to go to instagram or you want to   go to youtube   and it kind of is a discipline to be   like actually i'm going to choose that   first   and every time i do i get lost in it and   i'm so glad i did i'll start reading   somebody's   bible say they wrote or i just get lost   in a book of the bible and then i'm like   okay now i'm like done with my time on   my phone   and so sometimes that discipline that   something starts as a discipline becomes   a true desire um so then it's great   advice yeah so good yeah i think that's   great too and i think too   um you know you don't want to get in to   make it a habit to where it becomes like   a   like a legalistic religious you know   kind of mindset but i do think that if   you create healthy   disciplines that they can definitely   form your desires yeah   so good thanks for sending in good and

team you guys are   awesome and hey   so are all of you too thanks so much for   listening          you   hey y'all hey yo the moment you've all   been waiting for   maybe or maybe maybe maybe just us we've   been waiting to share   our uh how we found out we were pregnant   story and answer   some of y'all's questions because we've   gotten like a bajillion questions   since we announced to the world that we   are expecting   a little child a little child   uh the first question that we got asked   a ton and then we'll kind of get to   the story of how we found out is where   are we trying   no no not really but were we not trying   we weren't not trying no not really   but were we surprised yes we were   very surprised were we in quarantine   yes you know it happened but here's the   thing we have   said from the beginning of our   relationship well from the beginning of   marriage we're like   okay we believe that god's gift is a   baby like a baby is totally gift from   god   and if it is his right timing it is our   right timing   if he is good with it we're good with it   uh we are very capable of raising a   child we are excited about raising a   child   so we were just like whenever it happens   it happens   and so we were definitely shocked but we   were like   so happy keeps going over yeah sorry i'm   scared me   i'm proud you're squished pregnant i'm   getting bigger you're taking up half the   frame yeah i know i'm getting big over   here bro   um so anyways   yes we uh we're totally surprised so   this is kind of how we found out it was   crazy so   we had i did not know it's pregnant at   all to the point i mean   clearly but no but i'm saying like it   matters for what i'm about to say   we were going delaney and clayton my   best friend lady   uh is pregnant as well we were going to   their gender reveal party   and while we were there christian was   like oh   like you know it would be so fun to have   a baby he's like all in his feels and   i'm like i really just i don't know if   like i don't know if it's that time yet   you know which i just said whenever it's   a time but i don't know like right   before   and i i didn't know i was pregnant at   the time i'm like i don't know i was so   fun for laini and them   but like it's okay if like it's not our   timing you know we can just wait   whenever it's   whenever it's right and all this stuff   and i was like and i really don't think   i'm pregnant like   just at the moment i just really didn't   think so well lainey comes over to me   she's like say like i've been having all   these dreams that our kids are like on   vacation together they're growing up   together and like they're the same age   wink wink you know what that means and   so i'm like well   i really don't think i'm pregnant right   now so uh   that's cool but we'll see not this month   probably   so anyway she says that and then um the   next day like we wake up for church   and i am like i don't eat breakfast   typically which i know   breakfast is the most important meal of   the day but it's not my most important   meal i'm definitely everywhere it's been   disproven   i'm a dinner girl okay so breakfast i'm   never really hungry and then like at   lunch i normally just like   drink a smoothie eat something light   like i'm just not really hungry until   dinner that's my main event that's her   peek   that's my pee that is when i hit my   prime time   how do i hit it so anyways um we   we wake up for church and i look at   christian like i am starving   and he's like it's like yeah i think it   was like as soon as i wake up which i   never do that and he was like   oh okay ha interesting interesting   well i didn't you were like really   hungry i hope i was like i know like i   need some   food but we didn't get food because   nobody was hungry so like okay whatever   so go to church so we go to church and   then after i'm like   i'm so hungry so they suggest this   little uh   place where we ended up not going there   we go to another place and everybody   gets like a very light lunch like   christian gets like an acai bowl and he   like a quiche and i order a burger and   fries   and eat all of it and then i eat a   cookie   so i'm like man i'm ravenous and that's   that's really good on my part because i   was not thinking   i was not judging you no you didn't   judge me at all like i all   like it was normal and then that night i   like this whole quesadilla   which i may not always do okay but it's   just like i ate like a lot   okay and i was like i could not get   anything   oh yeah then ice cream i just could not   get full all day so meanwhile i didn't   even think i was pregnant i was just   thinking like   this is so weird i'm just like so hungry   today for some reason   so then i go to bed at night and then i   have a dream   which i'm going to tell you about the   dream in another video because it was   very significant   and um that's something that god really   speaks to me in which   i don't know what you believe but i'm   telling you god has given me so many   dreams that have like   come true and it's been very crazy and   it's just been a way that i've   thoroughly connected to the lord   so i mean and some dreams are whack you   know sometimes okay that   but some dreams are like no that was   that was some significant so i have a   dream   that somebody ran up to me and i'll tell   you that   person later in another video but they   said   you're pregnant and i woke up the next   day   and i was like that was so weird and   that just felt like very real   and so um i kind of thought about   throughout the day christian went i   don't even know where you went did you   go workout   probably probably you're probably going   to work out and i was like doing my   makeup because i had an interview to do   and i was like oh i hear something about   that dream maybe i should just go take a   pregnancy test   for fun just for fun i mean why not so i   take the test and i don't even wait for   the results because i'm like i'm not   pregnant why did i even take that test   i go and i start to finish my makeup and   i'll like go back   and look and it is a positive   a plus sign okay i'm like   what and then i'm like by myself and i'm   just like   what and so then i like go and i take   another test and it's another plus i'm   like   what and then i'm not even kidding it   was like the most exciting moment ever i   was like jumping up and down   i had tears coming down my eyes i was   just like god this is crazy this is the   coolest thing i ever kept living   pregnant   thank you god and then i like let it go   my knees it was just like   thanking god i was like oh this is such   a gift this is crazy i can't believe it   i just like had a total moment i was   literally like smiling this big with   tears streaming on my eyes it was like   the most happy excited   wild insane thing like i have a baby   inside of me   and so then i was like how are you tell   a christian and because i knew who's   gonna come home soon   um and i had an interview to do so i did   the interview which i   know is probably the worst interview i   ever did because i was like i'm pregnant   but i had to like not say that   so then um after that christian had like   drawn me this picture tell me what you   do so i drew   for some reason i was wanting to draw   like the the is it   rhyme riddle it's not a real the little   song   um sadie and christian sitting in the   tree k-i-s-s-i-n-g   first comes love then comes marriage   then comes   sadie with the baby carriage so i drew   that and like   scenes had you like us like sitting in a   tree then i drew us   scene scenes same yeah but keep in mind   it's all stick figures and this is not   ours so he draws me that because   honestly like christian like you've   always wanted to be a dad like you you   like love the idea of having kids and so   he was just like i can't wait to be a   kid so   he like drew that all the stuff so i   like take that away and i'm like   that's so sweet one day like i'm   probably gonna use that to tell him that   we're pregnant   uh so i like i kept this in my bible for   like months   and then um so i um   got the picture and then i got the   pregnancy test like the positive   and i put it under the drawing and i   told i was like hey when you get home   i'm going to be doing a video   but walking would be so cute if you   interrupted me so he gets home and like   sitting there doing the video and i'm   like baby i'm doing a video   and he locks up and he and he's like i'm   like look what i'm showing i'm showing   this drawing that you did for me   and he's like oh that's so sweet and   then i just like moved the paper   and his face was like what you   well for some reason my first reaction   like my first thought was like   that it was a test and that you were   just about to go take a test and that   you wanted me to be a part of it or   something i don't know why that was the   first place that my mind went   and then you saw the problem that's on   the plus and then i just i don't know   what i was thinking i was just freaking   out what was like okay so   i was one of my reaction like i was like   so happy and like   so i just like my reaction was just like   shocked because i was like   not expecting that at all especially   just the way you played it was so   so casual like you it was so casual   um but i mean just obviously just   shocked and just   over joyed and so excited and   you know just thanking god for for such   a blessing it was it was so exciting and   then i   cried and i was just and then we cried   and then no we all cried   it was such a sweet moment and so that's   how we found out   that um we were pregnant i literally had   a dream so i took a test   and then we were and then um we'll kind   of show you all videos and telling the   family   later but oh it was so much fun we   actually told my parents that night   because   like we could not wait i had like such a   busy week i had to like speak that week   i had to film a   four-part bible study series for right   now media   and i had to do like just a million   things and so i usually clear some head   space   i was like i'm not gonna do this and not   tell anybody i'm pregnant because i'm   like not the person i can keep a secret   very well   i have to tell you i mean i i'll say i   can keep   anybody else a secret i'm a vault   but not her i cannot keep my own secrets   for anything it's not a secret   so yeah mean it's i guess it's not   really but i can't like do that so i   like i was like christian like can we   please tell my mom   and so then we went to my mom and dad it   was so sweet um   i really played tennis with them all the   time and me and my dad had been playing   christian with my mom   because we had to switch up the teams   because me and christian beat them every   time   and then we couldn't beat them it's so   annoying so then i was like dad i   brought us like a good luck charm   tonight   and i had like a miniature tennis   racquet and   um they were like detective energy and   then   they got in a mentor basketball because   i always play basketball   and they were like they freaked out they   were so excited and   me and my dad did win that night only   one second babies made me better   won one game you didn't win the whole   well we didn't play a whole set   yeah but yeah i wouldn't have won the   whole time yes we would have no you   wouldn't know that yeah yeah yeah yeah   yeah yeah you would have come back   you have no idea they were doing great   um so anyways that was fun and then we   ended up telling his family went into   florida and told them   and that was the your mom's reaction was   so funny   yeah we got her like a um baby life   jacket because   they like are live on the water always   on boats and everything   and she goes is this for a dog or a baby   wait oh wait is this for a baby or for a   doll   y'all expecting       are you expecting a baby   i have no idea she didn't know if it's   for a dog   another human no we did not get that for   cabo yeah   it was really funny uh and people also   asked who is the best reaction who do   you think   i think honestly lanie's reaction was   really good   lady and clayton they were just like so   excited because like   they wanted us to be pregnant at the   same time as them so they like freaked   out like ran around their whole house   is funny his brother here's your guess   you can open   it's for you to use oh it's really sweet   soon   i really appreciate it it's for uncle   chance   no way

shocked but they were so happy like they   did not this is the funny thing nobody   saw it coming at all like   when lady and clayton were pregnant we   were like oh look you kind of saw it   coming   nobody saw it going over it   it was so exciting though yeah it was   funny too like even like one of   one of her friends was like oh she   there's no way she's pregnant   there's no way she's pregnant and when   they were like telling which of our   friends is gonna get pregnant next   and i'm like yeah little do you know but   we waited a lot to tell like all our   friends   and then we

just gonna get some gold   in your ears and uh i just think that   these things are worth repeating and so   let's go through it          we started out the year strong with my   grandma   too mama who brought the house down   i actually loved her piece of advice and   i actually i'll be honest with you   up front with you guys um i pretty much   chose like   four people for my family as some of my   favorite advice   and that might be because i've heard   them say it because it's truly impacted   me   so bear with me but i think it's pretty   good so to mama that's what i call her   she said this   if you can't change the situation change   your   attitude ayo slam   i thought that was so good um christian   and i talked about that the other day   because   he was in a situation he did not want to   be in and he was so frustrated that he   was in that situation   and i was like babe the situation is not   changing   at the moment you know and so you have a   choice you can stay in this   and you can have that attitude or you   can change your attitude   and we had this talk about how it's hard   in those moments to shift your attitude   because you're frustrated at a situation   but it's always worth it if you can just   walk away   take a minute reframe your mind to say   like i don't know   i'm grateful for being here for whatever   reason god   show me the joy in this moment it always   changes things for the better so i love   that piece of advice from two mama   we're just gonna go straight to the next   week in january   uh miles fidel who's actually   christian's college pastor in   auburn alabama um at acc church i   thought   his advice was so good that's what he   said he said the best thing you can do   during this season of your life is find   your own voice   you need to figure out what uniquely   makes you you and unleash   that i thought that was so good if you   see the sign behind me it literally says   live original   and i thought that was so key like that   is what we're saying when we say   live original it's like find out what   makes you uniquely you   god put something inside of you that   reflects his image   whatever that is the world needs to see   that we   want to see that so i don't know what   thing he put in you maybe it's different   than anybody else   in the world has especially your voice i   mean your voice   is different than the voice anybody else   in the world has so use it   unleash it let the world see it because   you're gonna make the world a better   place by simply being you   because god put something in you that is   good that even god called good   i think about that sometimes that   literally god was like creating   the universe and he's making something   as extraordinary as the sun   right and he says this is good and then   he makes something as   extraordinary as the stars and he said   these are good   did he make something as extraordinary   as the ocean he says this is good and   then he made   somebody like me and he said that is   very very good when he made me   and he made man and i think that is so   cool to think about when you look around   at creation it's easy to   to say wow god that that's the coolest   thing you made that   so good it's a little bit harder to look   at yourself and say that because we see   our own flaws   but i encourage you look at yourself   today and say like god you made me good   i want to bring out the good that you   put in me i love that advice from miles   moving on along so back in march my dad   willie robertson himself said something   i love he said   give more than you take and he said that   covers every aspect of your life   so i love that because i think a lot of   times we can become like consumer minded   and   we just want to like take take take take   take we want to get   get good get but it's so important that   we give   more than we take and i've seen that   motto from my dad you know he he   honestly gets   a lot he's a successful man he he gets   gifts he gets things but i'm telling you   even though he gets a lot he gives more   he gives so much he gives his time   he goes out and he works he cooks every   night for our   family and then he gives generously too   he gives his finances to   different places that need it and i just   think that's so important you know to   look at somebody's life and say man   that's so cool that they literally give   more than they're taking   i think it's great advice next we're   going on to jenny allen   i love jenny's advice she said her   husband says this to her   jenny don't be the fancy version of   yourself   just be you it's just so good again it   just reminds me of liv original   and i had this moment um last year at   passion i was so nervous   to go speak i was like oh gosh how am i   gonna do this how am i   how am i gonna do this how am i gonna   get up there and do this moment   and i turn around and kristen came   standing there and i said hey like i   need some advice   what do i do like how do i how do i   prepare for this   moment how do i step into this and she   said sadie just be   you she was like god doesn't anoint   another version of you   he anoints you and i thought that was so   good because it's so   tempting for us to want to be a fancier   version of ourself   or be a better version and in the sense   of not   trying to be like oh i want to be a   better version but being like somebody   that we're   not or looking at somebody and saying   i'm gonna kind of act like them in this   moment because it seems to be working   for them   or whatever that looks like and it's   like you know what like that's not who   god created you to be like   don't try to be that person just simply   be you because the truth is   like you're never gonna be a better   version of that person than that   person's gonna be because that's who   they are   i try to be the best version of who you   are just be you   don't try to be anybody else i love that   such good advice   moving along back in may   this one is so good mike and natalie   todd   um were talking about relationships and   they were talking about like sex before   your marriage and stuff   and mike and natalie said this moments   of pleasure   that are outside of god's will were   produced   years of rebuilding and that was so real   they were so vulnerable about their own   story and how they had moments where it   was like   they just desired pleasure so much and   they   would go through with that desire and   then that took   years of them rebuilding what   was outside of god's will and i just   thought that was such good advice for us   whether you're single you're dating or   even you're married you know that   sometimes it does take years to rebuild   but it's worth rebuilding   to make something that god created to be   beautiful and pure   make that beautiful and pure i thought   that was such   good um i thought that was such good   advice so that was incredible   i remember one time john piper said this   he said   the essence of good and evil is not you   know   breaking the law or doing the law it's   not doing the right thing or doing the   wrong thing   he said the essence of good and evil is   just   like the essence of good is desiring god   over everything else essence of evil is   putting something else in the place   of your desire for god so he talks about   eve with the apple and he says like   how eve it wasn't that it was just evil   that she just   broke the wall that she just just didn't   do what god said to do that wasn't like   the essence of it the essence was she   was saying   this apple is more desirable to me than   my relationship with god   and it's always stuck out to me because   i think sometimes we can get in such a   thing of like   what's right and what's wrong and then   it's hard to do what's right and what's   wrong just because we know that's wrong   we're not supposed to do it and that's   right   it's a lot easier when we say you know   what i'm   not going to do that not because i don't   want to do that i'm not going to do that   because i desire   god's will over my own and i remember   when christian i were dating that's   something we had to repeatedly say over   ourselves you know   we're not gonna go there because we   desire to see   god's will and so when you create a   desire that's so deep in your heart so   deep in your life   for god it's a lot easier to do the   right thing because it's not out of   punishment or it's not out of   guilt or it's not a shame it's not a   true desire of   who you love and that's god so it's a   lot easier to deny your flesh   say yes to god deny your own will   and step into the will of god that's   what i've learned and i think that that   is a critical thing to shift in your   thinking   i think it's gonna be a lot easier for   how to choose right from wrong   all right next up in may also we had   bella robb on the podcast my little   sister bella robertson   and i loved her piece of advice so that   i i took something from this   that i want all young people to hear so   she said this   it's the holy spirit's job to convict   god's   job to judge and it's only our job to   love   dash billy graham what i loved about it   is that bella   who was 17 a time that she did this   podcast was quoting billy graham you see   i think that's brilliant you know at 17   at 23 where i'm at wherever you're at   you know   sometimes like what we have to say like   we it's   good and it's worthy and it's valuable   but like at the same time we have so   much to learn   and when we humble ourselves and have a   teachable spirit and say you know what   i'm going to learn from the greats   i'm going to look at billy graham and   i'm going to learn from him and how   he did things i'm going to look at   whoever it is dot dot dot that you see   that inspires you and i'm actually gonna   take what they say   and put it in my heart and so that's how   bella has the wisdom to say   something like it is the holy spirit's   job to convict   it is god's job to judge and it is our   job to love because bella is listening   to wise counsel   maybe not by his counsel she doesn't   know billy graham it's not in her life   but why is counsel from afar and we have   the ability and the blessing to do that   with youtube with i mean literally   everything spotify twitter instagram you   name it you have like wise counsel   everywhere but as christine kane did say   in one of our podcasts   not all information is wisdom so you   definitely have to discern   but i love that and i think bella's off   to a great start knowing that hey   it's not her job to convict people   that's the holy spirit shock she need to   shame people she doesn't need to   judge people that's god's job that   that's toe to the lord she doesn't have   to get   caught in that judgmental spirit she's   just gonna love people because   ultimately that's what jesus told us to   do love your neighbor as yourself so   i love it bella rob that was so good um   moving along in june we had john luke   and mary kate on the podcast and   john luke says something that i thought   was so great it was such a fun piece of   advice   and like so john luke to say this he   said   if you have to eat a frog best city wood   in the morning   if you have to eat two frogs best to do   them one after another   dash mark twain which again i think is   so cool john luke was saying like   john luke is learning from people older   than him he's learning from somebody he   that inspires him that he looks up to   and ultimately that's kind of what the   whole world that's good podcast is about   it's about seeing somebody that we're   inspired by and saying hey   what inspired you seeing somebody that   influenced us   and say what influenced you and we hear   these pieces of advice in our life and   we see it played out and everything that   they do and i think that that is   so cool and so now we're seeing that   played out and even the advice these   people give hey   it's like you might see that i do a lot   of hard things in the morning i wake up   and i get my job done   and if i have two hard things i do it   right after another how do i   do that generally you'd ask how do you   do that well he listened to mark twain   if you have to eat a frog do it best in   the morning   if you had to eat two do them one after   the other thought that was so good   all right next in july we had lauren   daigle which is such a good podcast oh   my gosh she   just brought it she's such a genuine   soul such a sweet spirit   she said this true freedom is giving   people the permission to misunderstand   you   offense is taken not given   is so good because being misunderstood   is so hard   it's so hard to be misunderstood it's so   frustrating you want justice you want to   make it right you want people to know   the true you how you really are what you   mean by the end of the day like   we just don't get that sometimes like   not everybody's gonna understand us not   everybody's actually going to want to   understand us people are   actually sadly going to want to judge   you they're going to want to stay   jealous at you they're gonna want to   stay mad at you   and she said if you can get to the point   of your life when you allow   people the permission to misunderstand   you you will reach the   most freedom you'll ever experience   because then at that point   you can just freely love you can just   freely be yourself you can just freely   walk into the purpose god has for you   not   worrying about if people are going to   misunderstand you because you already   know that they are   and i thought that was so good i love   how she then follows that out with   offenses taken   it's not given you know that's offense   is   ours for the taking you know you hear   people say you know a gift from god is   yours for the taking   it's the same way with the fence it's   yours for the taking are you gonna   choose to stay offended or are you going   to   kind of deny that offense that somebody   throws at you   brilliant i loved it   next one moving right along we're going   to go to september we had max lecato   and i loved his advice it was so simple   for such a   brilliant man he said succeed at home   first which that is so good because the   thing is i think sometimes whenever you   get successful in life   or just really with anything you can   have a job it could be the simplest job   or the most extraordinary job   i think success in any manner you tend   to get   very focused on the job you start to   work really hard and you start to kind   of lose focus of the things that are   really most important to you   and so your priority shifts from your   family   to your workspace to the people that   work with you and   that's really a dangerous place to be   because really if you're not winning at   home you're really not winning   anywhere if you're not resting at home   you're not resting anywhere if you don't   have peace at home   you probably don't want peace anywhere   and so i loved his advice and i found   that to be true in my own life if i'm   succeeding at home first then the   overflow of what's coming from my home   is   actually making me more successful not   just in a worldly standpoint   but in a spiritual standpoint because i   have peace   i am driven i know i'm loved i'm walking   out the door   knowing that my husband loves me and i   love him we're at a good place   and so i thought that was crucial   so good a little more recently we talked   to carrie jobe in november   and her advice was brilliant she said   comparison will always steal   from the creativity and the calling on   your own life   brilliant so good comparison we always   say it's a thief of joy but   it's a thief of many things it's a thief   of your creativity it's a thief of your   calling   on your life and we kind of talked about   this earlier but when you start looking   at other people's life and wanting to be   them   it's like you're never going to be a   better version of them than them be   you you're always going follow up less   than somebody else trying to be them   but you're gonna be more than enough   being who you are   and so i would encourage that all day   long to not   look to the left to the right but be   like a racehorse put on your blinders   and just   run the race that god has for you   that's the most important thing that you   can do so don't compare yourself to   others i know it's easier said than done   but   it's so crucial that you stop that   pattern you might say   how do you do that how do you stop   comparing yourself to other people   and i think you mentally have to change   your mind   it says in romans don't conform any   longer to the pattern of this world   but be transformed by the renewal of   your mind   and i love that verse but there are some   key words in that verse i think that we   don't always think about it's that   there's a pattern of your mind   we can't conform to the pattern of the   world we can't conform to this   pattern and so the pattern of the world   seems to be comparing yourself to other   people and you know looking at the left   and the right not feeling like you're   good enough being insecure   being anxious also it seems to be a   pattern of this world so we're not to   conform to that but we have to   transform our mind and so   i think in that moment transforming how   do you transform like you have to work   to transform something like   there is a big production that goes on   to transform something and i remember   when i was trying to get out of that   comparison zone and   that jealousy zone i would literally   have to stop   the pattern of my mind and say you know   what i'm not gonna think that thought   anymore   i'm gonna thank you god for how you   created that person and i'm gonna thank   you for how you created me   and god i pray you would help me   celebrate that person   and not compare myself to that person   champion what they're doing   and god help me to do what you've called   me to do and so i think it's those   prayers it says moments of stopping and   actually shifting   to a new to a new pattern and your mind   is so crucial   lastly y'all we had christine kane on   and she brought it   and her advice was similar to lauren's   and i love how so many of these   interweave with each other   she said this make the decision right at   the beginning   that you will never be offended and you   will never take offense   if you can't be offended you will be   offended   true if you can you will if you're gonna   take it you're gonna be offended   i just love that make the decision right   now make it today i'm not gonna be   offended   why did i say both of those and why   don't i say all these things about   i think we kind of doubled up on   comparison we doubled up on a fin   offense we doubled up on um being   yourself whenever i was reading these   this advice   and i think the reason i really wanted   to stress these and re-read these to you   is   because these are really important   things it's   really important to be confident in who   god created you to be it's   actually really important to not compare   yourself to somebody else   it's actually really really important to   not take offense   because all of those things are stealing   from the opportunity and the calling   that god has on your life   you know i actually believe every single   one of you have a purpose and i believe   every single one of you was made in the   image of god and   made to be a good creation and i believe   that for you and so i hope that you take   this advice to your heart   and you actually just go out and you're   influenced by it i i hope that one day   somebody asks you   what's the best piece of advice you've   ever been given   and maybe even say one of these and you   hear a good old whoa that's good   but y'all 2020 has been a great year   thanks for um   yeah it's been a hard year it's been a   great year on the podcast been a hard   year in life   and i recognize that and i see that i   know we've had   the coronavirus that has taken so many   lives and taken so much time from people   and taking   jobs from people and it's been hard and   i know we've had   racial tension which i know nate is   talking about   and it's so such a good podcast as well   and it's hard and we look at that and   and it hurts and we're trying to be   better and we're growing but   every time you grow there's stretching   involved and that can that can hurt   so i know we've had a hard year there's   so many other things that have happened   there's been hurricanes there's been   fires been all this stuff   but i really do hope that this podcast   can bring a glimpse of hope in this time   i hope that what it does is it   encourages you to be a better person   in this time because there are a lot of   things that we can't change back to what   to mama said   we can't change our situation but we can   change your attitude and maybe we can't   change some of these big problems but we   can change who we're going to be   in the midst of these big problems and   so guys i want us to go out and be   better people   from one of the best pieces of his   advice i've ever gotten from my great   grandma mama   joe you're not kind because other people   are kind to you   you're kind because you are a kind   person go out and be who you truly are   and i think that'll shift the world   don't forget that passion 2020 is also   coming up   we're so excited it's actually passion   2021 even though it's in 2020   we already have passion 2020 uh back at   the mercedes-benz stadium which was   insane but this one is going to be just   as good even though it's virtual because   god is not confined to walls   his presence and his spirit can go   anywhere

we're gonna walk into 2021   stronger than we're leaving 2020. love   you guys          you   well   mama i will say you're the first person   on the podcast to ever bring in a live   audience   we have fans lining up at the door   fans we got corey robertson and   christian hub watch again because they   didn't want to miss   the gold nuggets that you would drop um   but for those who who don't know   you and they probably do because you're   the reason   this podcast even really started sure i   am no you really are   okay which i told you at christmas   because years ago my mom and i were at   an event   and the interviewer asked me what's the   best piece of advice i've ever been   given   and i said something you said to me   whenever i came   in i remember i was telling you about   all my problems and i was like mama   what am i gonna do about this situation   and i was trying to think of my revenge   i was gonna make   and you said well honey you are not kind   because   other people are kind to you you are   kind because you are a kind person   and that advice has stuck with me it's   on the wall out here   and mom in the interview literally said   in the microphone   whoa that's good and   behold the podcast began and so   you had a fingerprint all of this we   have so many   memories you you taught me how to play   uno   be a savage i never let you win you   didn't that's why i said you taught me   how to be established   because i'm not going to let anybody   else win either and whenever i have this   daughter   she won't she won't be able to beat me   because she taught me that   um no so many good things but i would   ask you   the question i ask everybody um what is   the best piece of advice that you've   ever been given   you know that's a hard question it is   see and i thought about it because you   warned me ahead of time   and the my grandmother   was really instrumental in raising me   because they we had a multi-generational   family my grandmother and grandfather   lived with us   all my growing up years so   and she had a lot of advice but once she   told me   when i was dating to always   look for a man who is kind to his mother   and he will be good to you that's good   and and it really stuck with me so much   and i don't know whether that just   became part of me   or whatever because of what she said but   those things that i know she was talking   about were   kindness and goodness and   respect yeah and all of those things   that you look for in someone that makes   you   happy yeah that makes you feel good   about yourself   and that's what i looked for and that's   what i found in a big   big way that's so sweet that's so cool   that you said that because i remember   a conversation we had uh standing at   counter culture me   even too mama i don't even know if   you'll remember this and i had just   broken up with somebody else and you   said well honey   you're just you kissed a lot of frogs   and you said   you were going to find your friends one   day and then i remember you encouraged   me   with because we were talking about pablo   shack and you were just saying he was   just such a sweet man   i remember thinking i don't think i've   dated a sweet   guy like just a really kind sweet person   because that's that is a huge trait in   people that   you know i don't think i think men   sometimes might not think that that is   of as much value they want to be   masculine they will be all these things   but to be sweet and to be kind is such   a huge treasure and an attractive thing   and something that is rare but it's   um you know that's how they're gonna   treat you and so i remember that kind of   shifted in my mind and then when i   brought christian home   and you said he's not a frog   and i was like and he's a sweet man and   it all just kind of clicked   you know you've got to be very very   strong within yourself   a man i would think that a man would   have to be really strong   within himself yeah to be able to   exhibit that   and be comfortable with that yeah that's   good   so with peppa you know y'all had an   amazing marriage how long were y'all   married   57 years yeah that's so cool   that's awesome and he was the greatest   man he also   told me that he was colorblind which is   why he always put the blue card over the   green and uno and i thought that was   true until like two years ago you told   me he wasn't   but he was a goober but he was just   awesome um he   what so i know one thing was kindness   and peppa that you looked for but what's   something you would say that you all had   in your marriage   that you would encourage other people to   maybe look for   if they're already married work towards   mutual respect i think more than   anything else   and always wanting to put that other   person first   we we always said even both of us   together that marriage is not a 50-50   thing   it's a 90 10 both ways yeah   because you you want to do the things   it should be within your heart to want   to do the things that make that other   person happy   yeah i remember um you know when   basketball was papa's life when we were   married he was a basketball player   and every night we went to a ball game   but that was okay with me because i   loved basketball   but later on i was thinking at times   when   he went to hear oh we had a famous   singer robert merrill   a tenor opera tenor who came to   alexandria when we lived there for a   concert   i was so excited about him coming and   peppa had never   gone to a concert like that before but   he went along   and he said it was the best thing he   ever heard   and whether it was or not he he   made me think he did yeah which was   important that's so sweet   i love that yeah not only that our our   two   oldest daughters were in an opera once   and he went to the opera and just it was   awesome he said we've got to do this   more   but he was enthusiastic about everything   that made me happy   and i was enthusiastic about the things   that made him happy   that is such good advice i love that i   have to tell you sadie this little quick   story   when we were first married and of course   we were so poor he was in the marine   corps and   we didn't make any money but we were   walking down   downtown in san diego window shopping   and in the window of this one store was   this   model with this gorgeous black velvet   coat   on with the rhinestone buttons across   along the front   and i just thought that was the   prettiest thing i'd ever seen   well peppa bought that for me for   christmas   wow yes i don't know of course we could   not afford that so i had to be very   cautious about   what i said what you said you liked   really made me happy because i knew he'd   work really hard to see that was done   that's so sweet i love that what a good   man i was like   this year for uh christmas i had just   like mentioned a lot of things that i   wanted for christmas from christian but   i was just kind of tossing it out   and i was so surprised when he like   remembered everything down to like   this little face exfoliant razor i was   like how would you remember   that that's such a good thing for   somebody to see what you love to see   what your face lights up for and   get it i remember peppa you know pebbles   love for basketball and that was   actually like where my love for   basketball came   you really had a legacy for that and i   remember being in like sixth grade and   like wanting   y'all so badly to see me play on the   varsity team so i was like i'm gonna   have to work   really hard because i got we got a long   way to go and that year i remember   shooting like a hundred shots   every day no making 100 every day i   couldn't go in until i made 100 every   day   and because i wanted so badly to be on   the varsity team   i did i know and then i made it in   seventh grade   and i remember whenever i went overseas   to play you gave me pet balls   pin his flag uh that he had whenever he   got it for playing in   the marines playing basketball   everything we did which was so special   to me   this is so cool well you guys uh set a   great example for relationships i   actually just remembered this   um when i was little and it was such a   weird memory like i have very   distinctive memories of pepla just like   little ones like playing guess who and   how   every time i spent the night with you he   would sleep on the couch and i would   sleep with you   but one other thing is i remember   sitting in that place   the room the computer room that y'all   had and he walked in one day   and he told me he said whenever you're   married one day and i mean i had to be   like seven   and he was like don't let the sun go   down angry at your spouse   and he told me that and it's so sweet   and so now   christian will always say for an   argument he's like i know i know sun   doesn't go down until   he until he stopped talking about this   because it means a lot that's one thing   i remember pit ball saying   the advice is something that we did in   our marriage it's amazing   i love it well you know you're an   amazing your amazing wife and   now you're a grandma a great grandma a   great   way great question great great grandma   you have a long legacy   so how many grandkids do you actually   have   i have   29 grandchildren   that's crazy that is amazing   29 today well now wait a minute wait a   minute no let's go back   i have 12 grandchildren 12 grandchildren   and i have 29   grandchildren i mean great grandchildren   great questions and then great great you   have   two two yes and you're about to have   two more i know yeah with me and mary   kate and you had six kids you have a lot   of kids   yeah happening so for me about to be a   mom with just one   what is your best piece of motherly   advice for me   i think the the biggest thing that you   can give your children   is to be a strong parent a strong   confident parent it's good   i heard someone say once uh when they   were   talking about rearing children about   children who were having   tantrums and just going completely   berserk   and that that's when your your job as a   parent is to go in and stop   that yeah because they can't do it and   they depend on you   to take care of them that's good so it's   that now   and that's a small child but i remember   when i was in high school   that when when my friends would   want to do something and involve me that   i didn't think it was   smart to do i would say oh my mom would   never let me do that   well whether she would or not i i hung   it on her   anyway that's good so i i knew then how   important it was   that you had a parent who said no that's   not wise to do   yeah that's that's just no we're not   going to do that in our family   yeah that sort of thing that's so funny   you say that because the mom used to   always say to us she was like   if you ever need to blame it on me you   can blame it on me   my girl said to you he eat it out just   say your mom said you can't because it's   true she probably would it's true          so a little bit mellow was talking about   about how   you never know whenever the best time   your life's gonna be because it could be   next there's always   opportunities to keep growing and keep   doing things and she just had so much   wisdom   of all the things she's done in her life   and i was thinking how cool   that is for her and how that could be   the same for us now there's a website   called skillshare skillshare.com and   basically you can go on you can take all   these different classes like   watercolor if you want you

go   try something fun this year that you've   never done          but that's so good i love that two mama   i asked two mama the other day so   two mama is your daughter my grandma and   she said uh i said was mama a strict   parent she said oh   she was strong she said she said she was   all fun and she was really cool but when   she snapped her fingers there were six   kids in line   and i was like that's awesome much   respect   and you know that i i made my children   sit on the front row in church   did you do that terrible thing i did   because i wanted them to know what it   was like to be   right there in front where everyone was   watching them that is to behave   themselves   see that's hilarious because i like the   front row and every time i start walking   towards christian's like no   not the front row not the front row   it's so funny maybe two mama made us do   that or something that's hilarious   um so i want to ask you about the legacy   that you built because   truly built a legacy like you have 29   grandkids who all love you and all think   that they're   your favorite which is really impressive   because you love everybody the same and   you   pay attention to everybody's life and   your and you invest in our lives you   showed up to everything i've done   to tennis matches and basketball games   and when i walked in   fashion week and did dance with stars   like you were there and that's so   impressive because you have a lot going   on   but when you think about leaving a   legacy for people   what is something that you keep at the   forefront of your mind   just as um the great grandmother that   you are is there some   advice you can give to somebody who say   maybe i haven't had a great legacy   i want to build a good legacy what are   some of those characteristics that you   think   have done that oh sadie   you know i really thought about this and   i even looked up the word   legacy and what that means   and it just   just live a life that someone wants to   emulate i think   it's good that they see something in you   that they want to be   yeah when they they grow up and it's   it's not   it's not anything special other than   just loving your family   and being available for them when they   are when they need help or you need   someone to always be there to   back them up that's good it um   that's a great answer that's actually   like for just somebody who is   your great-granddaughter like i've seen   that in your life and i can say that is   your legacy we all want to be like you   like everybody like two mama said the   other day she said two papa said man you   are just like your mom and she said   thank you that's a good thing i hope i'm   just like my mom   i know he did mean it well because she   was she's strong like she was being   strong in something and then   another one of our cousins was over   today and she said   um i said oh i'm about to go interview   my mom she said oh   okay good she said i was actually gonna   go over and talk to my mom today because   i needed some advice   because she has just done this so well   in her life that i need advice for and   she said but i'll wait till you're done   with me asking you all the advice to   share with the world so you have   this whole family who wants to learn   from you   seek wisdom from you because we see   something in your life that is   valuable and that has blessed so many   people and   your strength your love your ability to   show up and care   your ability to continue to make   christmas brunch   for however many family members we have   at your age is incredible yeah and this   year   after even coming through covid you even   made brunch for the family like   you're just very strong and that's   something that we all look up to   well that's something that is fun to do   and i know everyone looks forward to it   and enjoys it   and i wouldn't disappoint you for the   world so   i may be dragging in there at 95 and   doing   bananas foster we'll be calling   christian will be like are you going to   make your chocolate coffee drink because   i'll still drink   it i'll leave the recipe anyway i love   it ella we have tried to make it it's   not as good as yours   you have just the magic touch but it was   really good   um so i was thinking about this you know   you lived a long life i am   23. you are how old are you   will you tell us uh yes i'm 89 i will be   90   in april so awesome   so looking back what was something you   didn't know at my age   that you're glad you learned in life oh   honey i was so dumb   i was but but i was hopeful   that's good and always looking forward   to what was coming   and probably more than anything else i   learned patience   because i was an impatient person i   wanted   everything to happen you know like that   yeah can't click my fingers anymore but   it's   um and i learned that from from your   peppa shack yeah because he was   always he would always say let's just   let it lie a while   you know when there was a a crisis or   something that i wanted to fix right   away especially with   with our teenage children he would say   let's just let it arrive for a while   wow and see what happens and usually   it would work itself out it's good but   it takes patience to do that   yeah this generation needs to hear that   because i think more than ever we want   things to happen like this   because things do happen like that for   us you know we have especially apps   to make things you know happen fast we   want food we can get it delivered if we   want   uh entertainment we can click on an app   and watch a movie we   get things really fast and some things   in life you don't just   get like that you know you need patience   and that's such an   exactly that's really cool another thing   that   i learned from him was not to worry   because that we're not even supposed to   worry you know   it's scriptural that we are not not   supposed to worry   but he would say if i can do something   about something   i will do it and if i can't i'll worry   and the world will not fix it   that's good that's good that's a word   for everybody   yeah it's another thing with us right   now i think we're so   anxious like more anxious than ever and   it is scriptural so do not worry   about anything what you wear what you   eat and   then the lord even says like what what   does he compare it to   do you not see how he takes care of like   the birds how much   more will he take care of you exactly   that's so good   um of all the decades that   you've lived because you've lived   through a lot because i even asked you   the other day i was like   have you ever seen a time like this and   you were like yes   world war ii and i was like oh yeah you   did live through a lot of things   so of all the things that you lived   through what was one of the hardest   decades   and what was one of the greatest um   the hardest is was a time during the 80s   when we were going in louisiana we were   just cursed with a bad depression   the oil industry all left shreveport   where we were living and   moved to out of state and   there were at that time there were 1500   house fha repos on the market insurance   industry for louisiana which means   people had just walked away from their   houses   without paying any kind of mortgage or   anything wow   and um we were in the real estate   business so it was devastating   to us and we we we lost a lot of our   holdings at that time   financially it was just totally   disruption   and and it was so hard for me because i   had to see what effect it had   on my husband not just our family but my   husband   and if it had not been for our faith   and our family we could not have gone   through that   and come out well so that's an easy one   but that's sad stuff and i don't even   think about that anymore   i'm just like scarlet   i'll worry about that tomorrow but   anyway   it's um the happy the best one   may yet be there you know i have always   felt in my life   that whatever age i was was the best age   to be   and i would not go back for anything wow   i would not want to make the same   mistakes or even correct the ones i made   because hopefully i learned from them   yeah but   it um so i don't know we'll just see   what the night is old   i love it i love it see that's so cool   because not many people say that and   even   when i said like will you tell us who   you are because people don't want to say   that for some reason and for you to   probably be like well yes i'm 89   about to be 90 and there's so much more   to come and   i do think that that is one of your   having two more grandma great   grandmother you are a great queen baby   you are you have a lot to look forward   to and i think that's that's so powerful   and that's something i want to take from   and not   look back because even at you know 23   and this   seems crazy because i know i'm really   young but we've done like a lot of   really cool things   and i feel like sometimes i'm like oh   man when i was 17 a lot of really good   things happen like   but always believing god for more that   like there's greater things to come and   they might   not seem as significant as a big moment   but they're significant   in the specialty of the moment and so   i love that that's such good advice your   importance that you put on the big   things change yeah   that's true yeah that's so good i love   that i think   i you know looking at your life i do   think that's one of your keys to success   because you know you do always look   forward to the future and you know   you're not done yet   um but what would you say is a key to   success for for   aging well because when people look at   you they're like how did you age so well   people always think you're my grandma   not my great grandma and   when they hear the things that you do   like i said that like i'll pass your   house and you'll be outside with a leaf   blower like   hey honey like you were also the first   person i knew that had an iphone like   you're constantly just in the cool not   to mention you shop at free people   what like that's just where i shop so we   could end up with the same thing one day   like you're just very cool   what would you say is a tip to aging   well   well one is to accept change   and even embrace it when it's it's a   good thing   yeah keep learning always keep learning   i think the biggest thing for me that   has been   in my favor is being surrounded by   people i love   and that love me back it's good and that   that is so good   it was so funny you said that because   my granddaughter ashley and i went to   australia four years ago   and we were part of a tour with uh all   these chinese women   and we were we were climbing up   a kind of a minor mountain and of course   i was so much taller than everybody else   and i was   up with the guide in the front and   someone back in the back   one of the chinese women was hanging   back and the guy back there said to her   that that woman up there is 84 years old   and she's walking with the guide and   they all   looked at me in a totally different look   because in china   when you're that old the family takes   care of you   you don't do anything anymore you just   sit   and grow old yeah and so from then on   they followed everything i did i'm   serious it was really awesome   we were we had this one woman who was   always   over my shoulder no matter where we were   she was there   and then one day she showed up with   someone who spoke english   and translated she had been following me   until she could get a translator to talk   to me   and she wanted me to come to china and   talk to chinese women   yeah about how to grow a home yes that   is amazing   that's so good the first thing i told   her was   tell them to get a computer   that's good advice as i'm telling you   first one with the iphone you knew a lot   more than everybody else   that is so funny mama you're famous in   china   well maybe they'll listen to this   podcast and be like that's the woman   that's the woman that we watched there   she is she she's doing it   man you truly are an inspiration to so   many   people i mean our whole family anybody   knows you all my friends are like we   just want to be like mama joe   and even which we haven't announced our   daughter's name   we're not going to yet but her name is   in remembrance of view   in a really significant way so everybody   just   loves you you mentioned earlier about   going through a really hard time   and you know we're clearly going through   a hard time   right now in our world 2020 was hard and   2021 is a new year but still a lot of   the same hard things are rolling in   and so from someone who's been through   multiple hard times in our nation and   your own personal life   what's your advice to people getting   through a time like this where it just   seems   you know wild oh i think along with   everything else that happens to us honey   this is all temporary   yeah it's this is of course it's that   old adage of this world is not your home   this is we are just sojourners here   which means we're just stopping for a   while   yeah onto a better place in another   place   yeah and it and to know that the lord's   in charge this is what   is so comforting to me and hopefully   to everyone else that is a believer in   him that he's in control of this   all and he does not want bad things for   us   this i'm always surprised when someone   says in my hearing   that how could god let this happen this   is the world   that lets things happen to us it's his   and he is the comforter the sustainer   for us   through all of these things that happen   yeah here on earth   preach it's just well i'm not a preacher   hey where did i get it from i got it   from somewhere oh you've got it you   you have a better legacy there than from   me but it   um   my fa my faith in god is such a simple   thing it   it really is i've never thought it had   to be complicated   and it's just that god's in charge   and he's going to help me through this   and there have been some really hard   times you know   we i lost a nephew that was so dear to   me when he was 11 years old   and that was the worst time   and i remember my brother who was a very   strong man   in the faith it was his son   staying on our way home from the   hospital when this happened   that he's in the best place   and we're the ones who have to stay here   and remember him   wow and it was just such a powerful   testimony for him to say at that   horrible time   in his life and if nothing else that   just strengthened my faith   wow and all this time wow and there's so   many people needed to hear that   because a lot of people have passed away   this year that are close to other   a lot of even i mentioned this in the   prayer just you being here that a lot of   people lost grandparents and so   it's a beautiful thing for them to have   somebody wise and older speak into our   life but   that is such a beautiful thing for   somebody who lost someone so dear to   have that perspective that   they're the ones who are in the better   place and we're   getting to them we're a little behind   the pace to get to the   eternity and how beautiful it will be   you know when peppa when papa shack died   which was a terrible horrible time   but i remember your grandpa saying   well i can just see dad up there   saying well garden seed their shack   that's so funny and it just came out it   just   lightened my burden so much to realize   that that was really happening   that's so sweet such a sweet thing for   him to say   i was just telling christian the other   day that one of my great-grandpas used   to say garden seed   and how funny that was oh man i remember   when when peppa shot passed and   i remember we all went and had like a a   party at two mama's house   and i was like why are we having a party   because i could not stop crying   and i don't know if it was mom or two   mama or one of y'all   explaining to me that because it is a   celebration because he would want us to   be happy that he's in heaven   and in eternity and it's just a   beautiful thing to shift your mind   towards heaven and to shift your mind   towards the goodness of god   well i know that's going to help so many   so many people   pablo shag and pebble howard are   hopefully watching listening in   there are a cloud of witnesses i   actually remember whenever i was little   when i would pray i would say   dear god um would you mind if i talk to   people i shock and pitbull howard for a   minute and i would just talk to them   as if i had the line he would just   transfer me   and so uh they know that i'm talking to   them too   mama you're incredible we have so much   good advice so many fun stories and just   the legacy that you live   you make me cry so i have to wrap this   up or let that start   i'm not stopping but we love you   everyone in the world is going to feel   loved by you just from this podcast   uh i know it's funny because you're the   most confident strong person i know and   you said you were nervous   to be on this podcast and by the way you   told me you were going to hit me with   one liners and not have anything to say   yeah right yeah right you had gold so   for those of you listening i hope that   this encourages you and that you uh take   so much good advice from the well of   wisdom that she is and   i hope it strengthens your faith in god   and it helps you get through hard times   and even embrace the times to come and   look forward to the future in your life   no matter how old you are   if you're 23 or 89 there are things to   look forward to but my mom thank you   we love you so much that was so good i   loved it   that is so good   well mom from your wise words years ago   whoa that's good i think we need to add   that was   really good really good i'm so glad i   was here to hear that   i was like over there like balling   crying i was like don't look at me   because i   had you like right in the peripheral and   i kept seeing you do this   and i was making me about to start   crying it was so sweet i loved it   so much good advice i also was like why   am i not writing all the sound but then   i was like oh i don't have to write it   down because   it's only we're going to listen to it   it'll be here forever i know i was   thinking about i was like this is my   favorite piece of advice she just said i   was like no this is no this is oh i know   there's like a million   so much good stuff yeah yeah well   business per usual on to the good and   bad advice that you guys sent in thank   you for sending in good and bad advice   to the whoa that's good podcast   instagram   and also on our ello sister app which we   get most of our advice from so   thanks girls thanks everyone um all   right mom what do you think about   this in relationships so relationship   advice be an open book   i think that's great of course yeah you   want that you know that idea of like   being known by the person   that you love and that loves you so i   think being an open book is good you   should yeah   be able to kind of like lay it all there   before the person that   you love and that loves you i agree i   think you should wait until you   know you know it's a serious   relationship because sometimes people   getting relationships are like   and i've done this they're just like let   me tell you everything about my life   and then you like break up a week later   and they've only met you for like two   weeks and you're like   now you know everything about yeah i   guess i'm speaking for like a really   really   nice relationship that you want to like   yeah you think is   there for the long haul definitely be an   open book that's great i think whenever   you're fully known that's when you know   you're fully loved there's a lot of   security coming   for that comes with that all right   marriage is only as good as your   singleness   i don't know about that i mean because   everybody's stories different yeah   yeah i mean you might be in a rough   season   in your singleness but you might you're   going to have an awesome marriage so i   think you should like   put that on yourself that like oh   because some of my single days were hard   and   weren't fulfilling or weren't this my   marriage is going to be the same   so no i agree not necessarily and like   you all get married at   18. so like our singleness was like high   school you're like 10 years old you were   single   right so that didn't really count yeah   all right   this is good don't play the victim to   circumstances you created hmm   that's really good that's really good   yeah yeah i think people   could yeah you're like all of a sudden   you're like oh my life's so terrible and   you're like um   but how did you get there and there's   choices that you made that put you there   and i don't think   really playing a victim is ever good in   any situation you know you should see   yourself more as a survivor of things or   more of a person who overcame things not   or a victim   that's like memoirs like yeah no one   talks about hard times that she was like   i'm not getting as well on that and i'm   not having a good thing about that   because i was so long ago like   it wasn't like oh and then this happened   as a seminar she's like yeah it was a   hard time for everybody   yeah and our faith drives through it   right it's inspiring that way   i think it's good i love it well guys   you all need to keep sending some good   advice   and some bad advice if you want us to   talk about it or discuss it and we will   uh but i think we'll just leave it there   because memo knocks it out   of the ball she killed it i loved it it   was so good i think it was what's so   funny about it too was   you called me and were like

christian   what up come on stand though   you cute yeah that is a testimony   somebody's single said god won't you do   it   he will do it i'm telling you he's   faithful uh   she said yes lord bless

little baby huff with me too   and you know the cool thing i'm so   excited to speak tonight because this is   actually the last time   i'm speaking in public before i had the   baby   so i'm pumped and i will tell you   something   so cool you want to talk about   accountability right   we all talk about having an   accountability partner when you have a   baby   pushing on up against you like fighting   in your stomach   punching you in the summit you start to   feel   really accountable for the fact that   there is another generation coming   behind us   and what we do really matters and what   we say   really matters and how we live and how   we lead   really matters because things might be   bad right now   in the world but god is still good and   life is still coming forth   so we can't quit we can't give up   we can't sleep on it because we got a   generation coming behind   us and not to be all mom mode because   i'm only 23 i like totally get   everything y'all are going through   but i'm just saying something shifted in   me my faith grew a lot   when i had the accountability of little   hands pushing on me   there's a generation coming behind us   and it's really important   what we step into and how we lead and i   want to see   i want to see god do something huge but   the thing is god is always willing to do   something huge are his people willing to   step into it   are we willing to say yes are we willing   to deny   ourself deny our selfish desires and say   yes to his spirit that's what   i want to talk to y'all tonight about i   want to talk about john 10 10. that's   not really   where we're going to land let's just go   where we're going to start   but john 10 10 says this the thief comes   only to steal   kill and destroy so right here we see   that the thief   the enemy has a plan we always talk   about god's plan for our life   we don't always talk about what the   enemy's plan for our life is   they mentioned it the enemy's plan the   thief   has a plan and it is too still it is to   kill   and it is to destroy a little   intimidating but don't worry because   listen to this   but jesus says i came that you may have   life and have it abundantly so yes we   have an enemy with a plan   that is still kill and destroy but we   have a god who says my plan for you   is that you will have life and you will   have it abundantly   and god is he's a god of his word so i   was reading   the story of joseph which i love this   story y'all y'all you   like people will say like the bible is   boring i'm like did you read it   because like it is crazy and the story   of joseph is like insane   and you see this whole narrative really   play out   this thief coming to still kill and   destroy but yet god giving life   and life abundantly so back story on   joseph if you don't know   the story his father was jacob other   known as israel   he had 12 tribes 12 sons right   joseph was one of his sons and joseph   was the guy   that had the coat of many colors so   funny story   when i got my wisdom teeth out you know   things get a little crazy   after that surgery a little cuckoo and i   remember after going with some teeth out   i looked at my mom and i said mom   i saw it she said what i said   the coat of many colors and i said   it was amazing so just so y'all know   it's really amazing i don't know if that   was like the legit one but i totally saw   it   it was awesome but joseph didn't just   get a coat of many colors from his   father it wasn't just   like a good gift that actually meant   that he had the birthright   that meant he gets like all the favor   all the blessing all the special   treatment   and it actually meant that he didn't   have to work like his other brothers   so you're gonna kind of get a lot more   of the narrative if you realize   what this coat that he wore really   represented   so we're gonna pick up right here in   genesis 37.   i didn't put the notes or the the   scriptures on the board because we're   gonna be reading so much   and if you're 80d like me you'd be like   oh my gosh like   just listen to the story so jacob lived   and landed of his father   and then it says this joseph being 17   years old   which this is really cool too so from   the time we start the story tonight   to the time we end it joseph is going   from age 17 to 30.   anybody in between that age 17 and 30   pretty much all of us what up   so i think sometimes it's really easy to   look at people and be like yeah one day   whenever i like get my life together and   i'm like 40 i'm going to be so awesome   i'm going to like live it for the   kingdom but it's so important that we   don't   wait to step into all the things that   god has for us because we can step in   right now   so joseph is such a great example   because he's our age when we're talking   about this   so he's 17 and he was out in the flock   with his brothers   and then it goes on to say now israel   who is jacob   loved joseph more than any of his other   sons because he was the son of his old   age   and he made him a robe of many colors   but when his brothers saw that their   father loved him more than all the other   brothers   they hated him and could not speak   peacefully of him   now joseph had a dream and when he told   it to his brothers   they hated him even more so joseph has   all these brothers who actually   absolutely hate him they can't speak   peacefully about him   it goes on to say that they were jealous   of him because of these dreams and   they were kind of intense dreams it was   like basically joseph was telling them   one day i'm going to rule over all of   you and nobody wants to hear that   especially   a brother so they had some reason to be   angry but but they like   really hated him to the point that one   day   jacob says hey go out there and check on   your brothers and make sure they're   doing their work   so jacob joseph's all innocent he's just   gonna go out he's gonna check on the   brothers make sure they're doing   everything meanwhile the brothers have   another plan listen to this   it says they saw him from afar and   before they came near to him they   conspired against him to   kill him so i don't know if y'all just   picked up on this but that just went   like from zero to a hundred   like that went from like i'm jealous of   you   i kind of hate you i can't even talk   good about you i'm super annoyed that   you have a gift from god   so i'm actually now going to kill you   they said here comes this dreamer come   now let's   kill him let's throw him in a pit then   we'll say a fierce animal devoured him   but reuben says you know what actually   let's not kill him   let's just put him in the pit and let's   just see what happens let's just take   his coat and see what happens   so reuben kind of gives him some hope   but then it says they   joseph got over to them they stripped   him of his robe the coba   the robe of many colors that he wore   they took him they threw him in a pit   the pit was empty and there was no water   in it   so this is like terrible they literally   just try to kill their brother   they strip him everything he has they   throw him in a pit they mock him for   being a dreamer   and then it gets worse you're like you   know what what do we profit if we kill   him let's sell him   better idea so then they decide to sell   him into slavery for   less than what a slave would be sold for   their brother   and i'm reading this and i'm like wait   this is crazy   because i see a narrative in here i see   a plan in here   and it actually looks like still kill   and destroy   but what's weird is every time i've   heard that verse the thief comes to   steal   kill and destroy i've always thought of   like the devil himself   like i've thought about like the horns   the redness like   oh so they're a little snake like i i   mean like you know i mean like i don't   think about like a human   i don't think about me i don't think   about   christian i don't think about judah   i don't think about a person but yet   here we   see these brothers of his all of a   sudden   want to steal his robe they want to   kill him they want to destroy his dreams   they're doing all of the stuff   that's on the enemy's plan   and i look at that and i'm like you know   i've never thought about it like it   being   us but if we can be on god's plan   then maybe we can also be on the enemy's   plan   and that's something that we really need   to think about but you might say well   city   no no hold on i am not a thief   i am not a murderer i do not destroy   people   and i don't think anybody would probably   gladly claim that but when you look   around our world and there is   destruction   and there is murder and there is   stealing and there's all of this stuff   and you say how did we get there   well how do they get there if you go   all the way back all the way back well   there was some jealousy involved and   there is some mocking of them there was   this dream involved and they were hated   him and they couldn't speak good about   him   but it actually goes all the way back to   now israel loved joseph more than the   other sons   and it made his brothers hate him   they just felt less loved than him have   any of you ever felt less loved than   somebody   have you any of you ever just been a   little bit jealous of somebody   like somebody's like really killing it   and you're just like kind of jealous of   them   and then it gets so bad that you can't   even speak peacefully about that person   you want everybody to kind of   be in it with you that this person's   super annoying because you know honestly   you know they're killing it for the   kingdom but it's really annoying to you   because you're sitting there just   watching   and all of this and that is the pattern   and the pathway   to still kill and destroy   and all of that stuff is really   relatable we've all felt less than than   someone   we've all felt less loved or even less   liked than someone   you look on instagram and you're like   man she gets so much more than me   she's so much more blessed than me and   whatever it is you get mad you get   jealous   can't even stand them you kind of don't   want them to do good in life anymore   and you're on the pattern that the enemy   wants you on   still kill and destroy and it all   started from this one thing   so my first point is do not let the   enemy steal your security of love   do not let him steal your security of   love   you might say well sadie it's really   easy for joseph   because joseph knew his father loved him   like he got a robe of many colors i   don't how am i supposed to   know that i'm loved well if you read   this book it's really obvious you have a   father that loves you too   it's actually so obvious it says john 3   16 which all of you probably know   for god so loved the world he gave his   one and only son   to calm down on this earth and bear the   weight of your sin on the cross   take on death for you rise again and   invite you into heaven that's how much   he loves you it's so   obvious that your heavenly father loves   you but the second   a brother talks bout of you oh we're so   unlovable   the second somebody says you ugly oh my   god this is so ugly   the second somebody just said something   a little rude a little short you're like   does anybody care about me   and i want to tell you a harsh reality   but it's important to know that if god's   love is not enough for you now   then no humans love ever will be it   won't   because god is love in fullness god   is love he is perfect love so what   you're gonna get from a human   is an imperfect version of love still   amazing i   love my husband but if you compare it to   the love of god   and if that love isn't enough for me how   am i going to accept this love   so if you're sitting here and you're   thinking whenever i meet a man or   whenever i meet a woman or whenever i   get married then maybe i'll feel loved   how about tonight you say i know i'm   loved by the god who created me   don't let the enemy steal your security   of love   it's amazing though because what happens   is joseph gets sold   and now he's a slave but listen how   close he's a slave but it says   in the next chapter uh chapter 39   actually two chapters later it says   the lord was with joseph and he became a   successful man   as a slave in the house of potiphar   you ever heard of a slave considered a   successful man   he was a successful slave he was living   in potiphar's house the captain of the   guard which was   one of pharaoh's men and it said   anything that joseph did the lord caused   to succeed in his hands   so joseph found favor in the sight of   them and he was made overseer of the   house and put in charge of   everything that he had it said everyone   that saw joseph recognized the lord was   with him   so why do i say that part two well   because remember the second part of the   story is yes the enemy comes to still   kill and destroy but jesus says i come   to give life and life abundantly   so we see in this story that yes the   enemy can come and try to steal and try   to kill and try to destroy you   but even in the midst of that when you   remain faithful to god   he still gives you life in life   abundantly was he a slave   yes but he was a successful slave and i   think that's where things go wrong   is when we start to tell god what   abundance would look like   when we're like you know what actually   this is an abundance   i'm a slave this isn't what i had in   mind   and when we start to tell god what   abundance should look like we're going   to be really disappointed   because god's abundance might be in the   position that you're in that you don't   think looks very successful   but yeah here he is with joseph   goes on to say now joseph was handsome   in form and appearance like joseph had   it all going i'm telling you   he really was rocking it and after a   time this little handsomeness and all   this stuff again becomes a curse   says potiphar's wife sees him and   she cast her eyes on joseph and she said   lie with me   but he refused and said to his master's   wife behold because of me   a master has concern about he doesn't   have concern about anything in the house   and he's telling potiphar's wife i can't   i like no like i don't want any part of   this like   i actually have a great life i am in   control of everything right now   potterford trusts me i am not going to   sleep with you he said how can i do this   wickedness and sin against god   and as she spoke to joseph day after day   he did not listen and then she said   she kept saying lay beside me lay beside   me he wouldn't listen   but one day he went to the house to do   his work none of the men of the house   were in the house   she caught him by his garment said lie   with me but he left his garment in her   hand   and fled and got out of the house as   soon as she saw he left his garment in   her hand and fled the house   she called out to the men of the house   and said see he has brought among us a   hebrew to laugh at us   he came to lie with me and i cried out   in a loud voice   and as soon as he heard me i lifted my   voice and cried out and he left his   garment beside me then she laid the   garment up   so that when potiphar came home she   would be able to say   look what your hebrew servant did   so once again isn't it interesting where   we've just ended up   still kill and destroy   you say what she still wish she stole   his garment   did she kill him well yeah because at   that point if you were to say that a   slave slept with the master   his wife guess what the sentence is   death   she destroyed his reputation she   destroyed everything about him and where   did that come from   lust it came from wanting something   outside of the boundary of marriage it   came from her just   wanting so badly to sleep with him and   just egging him on it egging him on then   all of a sudden she didn't want to look   like   the victim she didn't want to look like   the problem so she just put it on him   kill stolen destroy kill   still and destroy i want us to see that   our decisions really matter   the little sins the little things that   we don't think are a big deal that   people are never going to know about   nobody has to see   that has a plan that has a purpose   james 1 talks about it says this   in james 1 james 1 verse   15 then desire so it says 14 i'll start   there but each person is tempted when he   is lord and enticed by his own desire   then desire when it is conceived gives   birth to sin   and sin when it is fully grown brings   forth   death so there's a process to sin   it starts with just a desire then when   it's conceived   and it just kind of manifests in its way   in a little bit then   all of a sudden it gives birth to death   so whatever you're sitting on i'm not   saying you are the enemy and   by any means you're a child of god you   have   so much in you so much to live for   but what i am saying is you can be   influenced by the enemy   if you're not careful those decisions   lead to really dramatic effects   and this is what we're seeing right here   so again she tries to destroy him   she ruins his reputation and all this   stuff but   once again guess what god gave life   and life abundantly here's the thing   with the enemy sometimes i feel like   when the enemy can't actually destroy   you   and you can't actually kill you can't   actually steal from me what he does is   he just actually distorts people's view   of you   how many of you have ever felt   misunderstood and that is so   frustrating i am so sorry because that   is the worst feeling   i actually shared this message back at   my home church   with college students at my home church   and   i had this girl come up to me so i grew   up with these people   i was just sharing it on like casual   weekend and this girl came up to me and   she said sadie kind of talked to you i   said yes   and she started crying and she said oh i   have hated you for so long   hey girl nice to meet you too and   she's like and i don't even know you   i've never met you she's like i just see   you at church all the time and   she's like i mean every time you come in   i'm just so annoyed like i'm like oh   my gosh she's like i've always just kind   of thought you just do this christian   thing   and like it's probably just for   entertainment it's probably just because   all this   and like she was just spilling it all   out i'm like   okay yeah i'm so sorry you feel like i   hate that and she said yeah   so much to the point that when you   started coming to this college group i   left   i was like wow i'm so sorry and she just   gets it all out and she said but when i   was listening to you i realized   i was the brother so i was just jealous   of you   and then i started talking bad about you   and she's like and i got a lot of people   that's what a lot of people all this   stuff about you and she just got all out   and she's like crying i'm trying to stay   strong and meanwhile i'm like crying on   the inside like i'm so misunderstood   gosh you hated me   it's a horrible feeling it's a horrible   feeling to be misunderstood   and that is why it is so crucial that   you know who you are in christ   because when the enemy comes and he   tries to distort people's view of you   if you don't know who you are you'll   believe what everybody else says you are   you will   and so my second point is do not let the   enemy steal your identity   don't let him we let what we hear from   other people speak louder than what we   know   we are in christ one of my funniest   stories about my sister rebecca she's   hilarious she's from taiwan and she's   lived with us   i've been my sister for like 12 13 years   and she one day she's very into fashion   but one day   it was um a pretty you know hot day   in louisiana and she comes over and   she's wearing a jacket   and leather pants and boots and a scarf   and all this stuff and   we're getting ready to go and i say hey   becca like you kind of hot   and she's like yeah yeah you know what   i've been dressing like this lately   because   i can't believe what the temperature is   here and i was like   what do you mean like didn't you just   walk over here like it's actually pretty   hot she's like   no i checked the temperature this   morning it's like 41 degrees   how's it rebecca it's not 41 degrees   she's like   no look at my phone it's 41 degrees i   said okay regardless of what your phone   says   go outside like it's not 41 degrees   turns out rebecca was in the wrong city   like everybody had her iphone set to the   wrong city   and she was walking outside and she knew   it was hot   but yet she was dressing like it was 41   degrees because her iphone told her it   was 41 degrees   and we do that we know who we are   we read the scripture we know without a   shadow without   love but because social media tells us   one thing   or the news tells us the next thing it's   definitely what they say          and you cannot let the voice of the   enemy   and everyone around you be louder than   the voice of god   inside of you the voice of god on these   papers do not let the enemy   steal your identity   the last point i want to make is do not   let the enemy steal your purpose   do not let the enemy steal your purpose   get this   so after you know of course all that   happened   they wanted to kill him and they wanted   to steal from him and then when to   destroy him they actually just ended up   throwing him in prison   so joseph is now in prison but guess   what it says   crazy literally like i said the bible is   just so insane   it says that while he's in prison the   lord was with joseph and showed him   steadfast love gave him favor in the   sight   and made him keeper of the prison   anybody ever heard of a prisoner being   the keeper of the person   not me and the keeper of the prison but   joseph was in charge of all the   prisoners who was in prison   and whatever was done there he was the   one who did it and whatever he did   once again the lord made successful   so once again the enemy can try to steal   he can try to kill he can share the   story   but jesus and god will still give you   life and life abundantly   if you allow his abundance be the   abundant life that   is for you so joseph has been in prison   for quite a long time now   we get to this point where pharaoh   has this dream and it's very bothersome   to pharaoh he's like what is this dream   like it's freaking me out   and so everybody goes and tries to help   pharaoh out and so they get magicians   and they get the wisest people   and they need to figure out what this   dream is because it's so concerning   to pharaoh well while he's kind of   freaking out there's this chief   baker who at one point was actually in   prison with joseph   and this baker tells pharaoh wait a   second i forgot   there is actually this guy in prison who   interprets   dreams and listen to this   verse 14 of chapter 41   then pharaoh sent and called joseph and   they quickly   brought him out of the pit hold on to   that   and when he had shaved himself changed   his clothes and came before pharaoh   pharaoh said to joseph i have had a   dream there's no one to interpret it   i've heard it said that you can   interpret it   and joseph said this to pharaoh is not   me but god will give you a favorable   answer   so joseph says you know what no it's not   me but   but god inside of me what he's gifted me   to do   oh yeah i can do that but i want us to   read   something super crucial tell me if you   caught this   pharaoh sent and called joseph and they   quickly brought him out of a pit   notice something the very same thing   that got joseph thrown into a pit   is now the very same thing that is   getting joseph   out of a pit you see back   up to when he was 17 years old and he   said   i have a dream god's given me this dream   and his brothers hated him and they were   so jealous of him and they said   this dreamer look at him coming let's   throw him in a pin   as he's in the pit and he's stripped of   his clothes he's about to get so into   slavery   they say let's see what becomes of these   dreams   fast forward years and years later he's   sitting in a pit   he has beard he has slave prison clothes   he's sitting there for years   and all of a sudden pharaoh says   i need a dreamer i need somebody who can   interpret   a dream oh wait   there's a dreamer in the pit get him out   of the pit   get him out of the pit and so pharaoh   goes   joseph steps into this god-given moment   you know what   it would be so hard for me if i was   joseph to step into that moment   you know how much shame how much   insecurity was probably attached to that   word dreamer   i mean if it was me i'd be sitting there   be like dreamer   that's the reason i got me thrown in   here that's the thing people mocked me   for   that's the thing people hated me for   that's the reason why i got sold by my   own brothers   but joseph didn't sit there bound in the   bitterness of what people said about him   wallow in the fact that he was   misunderstood victimized himself   he said i'm a dreamer god put that in me   and i will use my gift       some of you need to hear that tonight   because you're   sitting in the insecurity and you're   gifting   because of what somebody said about you   five years ago   because they were jealous and because   they wanted to start   drama because they didn't even know you   and you're letting their voice be louder   than the voice   that god has already spoken over you          stop sitting in the pit   god is calling you use   your gift but you know what's amazing   about it   is that had joseph not use his gift in   the pit   he would not be used in the palace   you see a lot of us we want to wait   to use our purpose until we get on a   platform we want to wait   and to actually fulfill the thing that   god has until that abundant life   whenever we have all the followers   all the people listening the certain job   title when we get done with college   but if joseph hadn't used the people   that god put in his life like a chief   baker while he's sitting in prison   and interpret his dream how do you think   he would have ever been ready   to interpret pharaohs how do you think   he would have ever been ready for that   know how badly public speaking used to   scare me   oh my gosh in high school i hated   being called on to read the popcorn game   i was like can i just leave school   actually because i can't do this   i hate talking in front of people but i   started a bible study in eighth grade   god was preparing me in eighth grade   for what god was gonna use me for now   my favorite verse so then do not forget   the confident trust you have lord to   have confident trust in something   you have to walk with them if i want to   be confident in my husband   i have to confidently know and trust him   because of the character he's shown me   i want to be confident in god i gotta   walk with him   i gotta be faithful to him in eighth   grade in a bible study   faithful to him in the pit faithful to   him in prison   so that when i step into a position   that's so much bigger than myself   i can say oh not i but he who is greater   than me who is in me is absolutely going   to do that              do not let the enemy steal   your security of love your identity   or your purpose and he will try to steal   and he will try to kill and he will try   to destroy and certain things in your   life he will still   certain things of your life he might   kill   certain things your life he might   destroy if you look at it from a worldly   point of view   but you know what joseph said after all   this   what you meant for evil god   actually intended for my good       god says i come to give life and life   abundantly and that is what i will do   and guess what joseph and not only   joseph but joseph's brothers and his   whole family was blessed so abundantly   because of the things joseph went   through they had   food in the midst of a famine they had   houses   they had he ended up having children and   a family   and they were so blessed   and he's like i see that god has been   with me this whole time and he's been so   good   and out of the goodness that he has been   to me i can actually forgive you   and allow you to step into this too   you see for me it used to when a girl   would say something like that to me it   would crush me   in high school if somebody were to say   something mean   about me it would absolutely crush me   but that night when that girl was   sharing all that with me it hurt me it   did i cried a little   but i was able to hug her and say praise   god i'm   so glad that god showed you that and i'm   so glad   that we can be in this moment together   because when you're secure in who you   are   and you don't let the enemy steal from   you or kill anything   in you or destroy anything in you you   can actually bless people who have hurt   you   you can bring them into the goodness of   god with you   you can wish them the abundant life too   and so for you maybe you have been on   the path of the enemy   maybe tonight you're saying man i   actually   have been involved with certain things   maybe it's just the little things you   know like   it's jealousy it's just a little hatred   just a little gossip just a little lust   but i'm actually seeing tonight that i'm   walking in the plan of the enemy and not   in the plan for god and tonight i want   to repent of that and i want to turn   i want to pray with you tonight and   there's another group of you   who might be like joseph and i'm trying   to stay faithful   i'm trying to remain steadfast   in what god has for me but it's hard   but god i know you're good i know you're   abundant to you i say keep going   stay faithful keep giving god the glory   and the pit and the prison keep   showing up and using your purpose even   in the season that doesn't look like   abundance but you know that you know   that you know god has you and for a   reason   keep speaking into the people's life   like the chief baker who he put in   you don't even know how many people you   come in contact every day that's   craving the love of jesus that you have   in you   and you're called to be the light of the   world you're glad to let them know how   loved they are   you're called to preach the gospel to   them   everybody bow their head close your eyes   tonight you've heard from my brother   nate for myself but hopefully more   importantly you've heard from the lord   if tonight you realize that you're kind   of on that   path you're struggling and you don't   want to be   the planet i mean you want to turn to   god i just asked it right here   no one looking around that you'd raise   your hand   it's so important i think in this moment   because when we're   bold enough to raise our hand and say   that's me   then we're bold enough to come to god   and say god   please use me change me   you can put your hand down i'm going to   pray with y'all right now god i just   thank you so much   that you are stripping us back   all the things that aren't giving you   glory   god i pray right now for a heart of   repentance god   right now in this moment i just asked   that if that was you if you just quietly   say to the lord god i repent   of my sin   god i turn to you   god i want what you have for me   and nothing else jesus i pray that you   would honor that prayer god   god i know that your word says for those   who turn to you   the veil is torn where the spirit of the   lord is there is freedom so tonight i   pray that there is freedom   over every single person who has dealt   with just the   the sins of this world          god i just feel like i talked about   another group of people tonight that   there was people who are listening to   other voices louder than listening to   yours   some people are watching the news and   filled   with so much anxiety some people are   scrolling social media   and filled with so much insecurity and   they're   so distracted by what they're hearing   from other people that they can't   clearly hear from you   if that's you i just want you to also   raise your hand          god i pray that you would silence that   voice   god that they would put down the phone   quit   scrolling the news quit scrolling social   media   to find confidence god but they would   pick up your word and find true hope and   assurance   oh god i just pray and thank you for the   people   that are ready to run and to the plan   that you have for them   that are no longer going to let the   enemy silence them but they are   ready to run and set this world ablaze   for you   and tonight you've heard this and you're   just stoked for what god's gonna do in   your life   i just ask that you'd stand to your feet   as we worship   i'm gonna pray one last prayer over all   of us and then i want us to worship like   we are walking in the victory   no matter what season you're in no   matter what your life looks like right   now   i want us to worship like we are already   walking   in the victory because that is what   we're doing god i   thank you so much that you are   victorious god   and you invite us into your victory god   i pray tonight   god they will never be the same as they   said there was an old self   and there is a new self god and i pray   that they would be confident   in the new self that you have covered   them in god that they would walk with   authority   no more insecurity no more fear no more   depression   no more doubt no more little things god   but they would   continue to turn to you god and walk in   the fullness   of what you have it is in your name we   pray          amen   sorry i wore a sweatshirt i'm trying to   make sweatshirts business casual in   2021.   like i often wear sweatshirts i normally   wear sweatshirts but   you know very little things fit me these   days   and what's your due date may 4th oh my

back this is my   dream come true sadie thank you   well it's my dream come true and you   know i think you and bob goff are the   only two people i've had   on the show twice and y'all are   like kindness like similar people yeah   they are   i'm like i'm like a cheaper bob goff   i'm like i'm like the bottom shelf pop   golf and he's the top shelf bob golf   no you're just a girl version that's   right that's right that's right   it's awesome well i miss you i miss uh   seeing you in nashville   our frothy monkey hangs which i don't   even know if that is   a thing anymore because on the porch you   can be on the porch there   oh well that's good yes do you like how   the sun is coming in right now by the   way the sun is setting in nashville   that's only one thing you don't miss in   west monroe is the sun does not set at   three o'clock or whatever in the winter   there huh no that's so   very very early that's bad yeah so i was   thinking about this   um because i was just seeing i haven't   talked to you in forever and   how you were the first person that i   really saw on social media talking about   covid and how um you had the pants count   and i was just wondering do you still   have a pants count yeah   i mean so what happened is i got   quarantined the first week of march so   like   literally my friend who got coveted was   one of the first 10 people   in our city to get it and so at that   point the health department   jokes on them literally thought that   they could contain it if all of us   stayed home and of course sadie   i'd come home from tour i'd gotten off   the bus monday morning   and tuesday night i went and watched the   bachelor season finale   wednesday morning she put tested   positive for coving and we're all like   wait people have that in america wait   what are you talking about   and so the and so then because i'm not   married yet i don't have a kid yet and i   live alone   i was like i have to be in my house by   myself for 14   days and then it just kept going as   everything shut down and so i was like   i have to count whether i have on what   kind of pants i have on   i have to wear a different lipstick   every day i mean i made all these rules   to try to have i mean it's what we're   talking about it was i had to set up   all these little almost like buoys or   tent poles   in my life when i was trapped in my   house to try to help me have fun   in a really scary and and sad situation   i don't want to be alone that much it's   terrible   oh yeah that is terrible well i mean   annie you   you do have a thing for uh taking   what is it living to make it lemonade   yeah that's right that's exactly right   that's the quote but no you do and like   like you said that's what we're gonna   talk about today your new book which i   actually have right here that sounds fun   and you do you just make life fun and   it's cool too because not only did you   make something good out of something   that was really hard and have fun in a   really hard time and i know that was   hard   it's not like that was necessarily fun   but you made fun things happen yeah   my mom took you know you said you look   at her she learns from you she took from   your advice   we had charts on our house every kid had   to put like   what they're gonna do in quarantine what   hobbies what fun like all this stuff   bucket list from you   yeah so you were a fun instructor yeah   that's right i'll take it do you know   that happens to me all the time say but   people will   back when we traveled and such they'd   stop me at airports or   or at restaurants or even at church and   be like annie can i tell you what i do   for fun because it's the last question i   always ask on my podcast it's also   called that sounds fun   and it's because people have kind of set   me up as like the judge and the expert   like they want me to coach them and they   want me to judge their fun   and i'm always like if it's fun to you   it's fun you're doing it   it's awesome that's so good i love that   well that's a good point if it's one of   you it's fun because like   my friend steph that you know yeah loves   puzzles that's not necessarily fun for   everybody but hey i love that she loves   it she's in here   that's exactly right oh well i know   you've been on the podcast so you've   answered the question what's the best   piece of advice but do you have any   other good piece of advice that you've   been given   recently or whenever that you've thought   of that you want to share with us okay   so i've been thinking about this for   some days   and i'll tell you the thing that has   changed my life the most in the last   probably three to   four years has someone literally said to   me   just open your bible every day which i   know sounds ridiculous because i've been   a christian a long time and you have two   and but i didn't have a very good rhythm   of spending time in scripture i would   have quiet times quote quote as i say   and i would read   but it wasn't like daily and so what i   did   last year is i got a plan and i read the   gospels 12 times i read   matthew mark luke and john every month   for the whole year wow   and and it has i know this is going to   sound silly but it has changed my life   because now when we live in a world   where government's confusing and the   unrest is confusing   right and and who is right and who is   wrong   i have spent an entire year reading the   gospels   and knowing what jesus is like it's   awesome and so that would be   that's the advice that someone gave me a   few years ago that in the last few years   has really changed me is like   it doesn't have to be a hundred chapters   a day it doesn't have to be   100 pages a day but just every day if   you'll open your bible   there's so many plans out there you   version has a bunch you've created some   and she reads truth has them he reads   truth   and we did one on that's on my website   that's the   the gospel one that i did we like   designed it for the whole year   and it's just cool i know that sounds   crazy but it just you know this it   changes your life   it does change your life i love that i   saw you doing that on instagram posting   about the gospels each day   and i thought that was so cool and i can   relate to that because you know i'm   someone that i love the word i read the   word a lot but i am not that consistent   and so this year i was like i'm gonna do   a plan   so i started the buy one a year with   nikki gumbel on the bible app   and even the first 18 days of this year   like i have felt   so like secured just knowing that like   i'm rooted in the word and like   that's my every you know every day and   read it and it's not every time in the   morning sometimes i read it before i go   to bed but   just having that consistency of every   day has been huge and   i think for me i used to be like oh you   don't have to have like a plan you know   you can just read it and that's true but   sometimes in your life you need   a plan like you need to follow something   that consistency so   that's such good advice i'm taking it i   love it uh   i was thinking about this that i want to   talk to you about because i saw you at q   conference   and you and jenny allen actually got   into a great discussion   about y'all are hilarious discipleship   online and i think you use your platform   for   so much good your social media your   podcast everything um   but what would you say practical tips   for like the   average following person they're not   necessarily an influencer but they have   social media and they're like   i i'm the light of the world like i'm a   christian i want to use this like what's   a practical tip to help somebody use   their platform for good   yeah that's a great question sadie and   the truth is everybody's an influencer   there if you have more than one follower   that's not your mom   then you are influencing someone   someone's looking at you   and they are saying i wonder what   they're wearing i wonder what they're   doing   i'm following them because i want to   have   some view into their life that may   change my life every person i follow the   reason i follow them   is i want to keep up with who they are   or i want to learn from them or both   and so that so i think one the first   thing i'd say is remember that actually   you are   influencing you don't have to have   millions of followers   to be impacting someone's life um the   other thing i would say   especially in times of unrest is be   quick to listen and slow to speak   because once something is on the   internet   it is screenshot for all to see it only   takes   it only takes you losing self-control in   anger or in lust or in   unkindness or in gossip or in racism it   only takes   one moment of you losing self-control   and posting something   that other people can screenshot it and   we can all read it forever even if you   deleted it   yeah so jesus telling us or god telling   us to be   quick to listen and slow to speak was a   gift before we even   knew we would have instagram and twitter   and snapchat and take talk and all the   things   i love that because i think when   something happens in the world like you   feel like i have to say something i need   to say something i want to say something   and it's so wise to just stop and to   think and to listen and   pray about it ponder it before you put   it out because i think we saw that a lot   this year like   obviously cancel culture is not a good   thing right but i feel like   there's also something to us thinking a   little   bit longer or praying a little bit more   before we just put something out   so that we can avoid offending someone   and you can't always people   are very offendable these days yes but   at the same time just using that wisdom   with your words so i think that's so   good   because it's important to remember that   scripture doesn't say be quick to listen   and then be silent   it actually does say there is a right   time if you're supposed to be slow to   speak there is a right time to speak up   for justice for our neighbors for those   that are less fortunate than us   there is a right time to speak up that's   good we just need to be slow to it   just not never to it it's great i love   that that's good advice right there   someone's gonna take that   i love it well i want to talk about your   book that sounds fun which is also like   your podcast that sounds fun   okay so i have to ask you because you   know enneagram is so fun for anybody to   talk about   do you think that being a seven kind of   helps   you influence your writing a book called   that sounds fun totally   because like when i jenny and i just   taught jenny and i just talked about   this   um when you think about who wrote the   bible i'm like i wish   a seven would have written one book so   that we'd see like what were the funny   things going on   right yes so yeah i totally i think each   it's just like the body of christ we   need all these people serving in all   different ways so that we can see the   fullness of who god is   great and so i need to write books like   a seven because the world does need   someone   while the threes are reminding us to   work hard and the fives are reminding us   to research   and the nines are reminding us to care   about other people more than we care   about ourselves and the twos are   reminding us to serve and all that   the sevens have to remind us like yeah   but are y'all having a good time at all   is anyone having a good time and is   anyone making space because that's what   it is   is it's the healthiest moment of fun is   the moment where you've made some space   and there's a little   deep breath for your soul and and so   yeah i   absolutely think my sevenness plays into   writing about fun but you know what when   i was growing up sadie i would think   man why how come everybody else doesn't   think about fun this much am i immature   am i like is there something wrong with   me and the longer i've been annie   the more i've gone like no you know what   god doesn't mess up when he makes me   and he doesn't make it mess up when he   makes any of us and so the things that i   love   are the things i'm meant to love and the   things i mean like puzzles with stuff   right   yeah but really the like the the   strengths that i have   are meant for the world yeah and so and   really the book is called that sounds   fun it is about fun but it's so much   about   learning how to love how god made you so   you go   after the things that you love that the   whole world flourishes not just   you quietly in your own little life so   good that's like the message of live   original it's like take what god has   originally   placed in you whether that is something   specific or something like   the idea of having fun and use it for   his glory use it for good   and i i think that's so cool   annie is so fun and i love that we're   gonna start talking about some hobbies   that you can pick up on   but if there's another place that you   can really hone in on the hobbies that   you're good at it's called   skillshare skillshare is a place you can   go online   take classes of any sorts if you want to   go learn how to do something new this   year this is a great place to start   because it's literally less than ten   dollars a month to do it   not to mention if you go to   skillshare.com   whoa

daniel and   rachel and it's so cool because for me   like i have a lot of products and   you have to get photographers and   different things it's like this could be   a cool skill to just like   learn and what i love learning is that   you don't have to have a professional   camera you can literally use your iphone   and they teach you skills like that and   so   there's just a lot of

some fun a little color in your life by   going on skillshare and trying it out   for less than ten dollars a month so   go take a look i wanted to ask you   because   obviously being a seven has played into   that but also this is who you are that's   who god made you to be   do you think genuinely that everybody   can have fun   like i do buddy i think it i think it   looks different for everybody   i think what's happened is that we've   decided that fun   is disney world and there are people who   think fun   is rocking in a rocking chair on a back   porch and so they would say to you and   me   well i'm not very fun like a lot of my   friends who are moms will be like well   i'm not the fun mom and i'm like   well your kids think you're the fun mom   but when you look on instagram you don't   think you're the fun mom that's true   right so everybody real it happens to me   all time study where people walk up and   say   uh you know they'll be telling me their   fun thing and they'll start with i don't   know if this is very fun   or when i ask my guests on the podcast   at the end what sounds fun to you they   go i don't know if you're going to think   this is fun   but yeah i'm like yes if you think it is   fun   if steph thinks puzzles are fun then   game on   puzzles are fun for her but the problem   is is when we decide that   fun has to be expensive or big or   disney world and then we think well then   what i'm doing is not fun   it's so cheap and the reality is no if   if you think you're having fun   you probably are having fun you   that's so interesting because you know   we talk about comparison a lot but you   never think about   comparing your fun except for you do   that all the time   all the time because it's comparing your   cool it's the same thing   it's that you think you aren't purposely   going is that person more fun than maybe   you're going   wait they look like they're having more   fun than me which makes me sad because   i'm in pain   or it makes me sad because i didn't   think of it or makes me sad because i   don't have the money to do that   well of course they're having a great   time because they're married   or of course you're having a great time   because they're rich and you're like   nah man do you like cross stitching then   you're having a good time   do you like cooking in your kitchen have   you learned to make your own   marshmallows during coven   you're that's awesome like you're having   as much fun because the thing we don't   know   or we can't really define about the   people who are going to disney world for   fun   or going to paris for fun is normally   their hurts and their pains are about   equal to the level of   of escapism we see them do so   and so you're like man these big   celebrities who get to do these big   massive trips   yeah there's a lot of pressure and a lot   of pain in their lives too that we don't   experience   so let's like celebrate that a puzzle is   relaxing to us   because that also means our stress is at   a level that a puzzle can help   yeah that's so good man i love this   i actually i you don't even know you can   learn so much about fun   that's my goal girl i love this this is   amazing   okay so what i've found whenever i write   books is that like every time i go to   write a book i always get challenged   with the message i'm writing   and i feel like in the writing process   like i start doubting like   well am i really like fearless because i   struggle with fear am i really like   living because today was kind of stinky   or whatever it is you know it's like   had you been challenged in this message   as you wrote it   to and especially in the year that we've   had right a book like that sounds fun   have you felt that challenge in your own   life so i turned in   the first draft in   april of 2020 and we changed about a   third of the book by september october   of 2020   because it was like i'm talking a big   game but now i'm trapped in my house   alone   and all my trips are canceled i mean i i   had a big birthday in the summer and i   had a big trip to england scheduled and   i mean i you know we all lost a lot   in 2020 and so far in 2021   and so it wasn't i'm with you that most   of my other books it's while i'm writing   that i'm wrestling it down   and this one i wrote it was kind of like   yeah i feel all that now there's a   couple of like   really sad moments in this book before   covid   of like man i had to like i thought this   was gonna be a thing   and it didn't work out there's a chapter   about how i had a dog for six days and   then i was allergic to it   sadie it was awful i cried writing it i   cried reading the audiobook   men tell me all the time that are   reading the book that that chapter makes   them cry   that will make me cry awful it's awful   it's called the pet shop   read it or don't but i've warned you   i've warned you i only had the puppy for   six days   but what happened during covent is i i   this felt like such a gift from god   sort of in that i got to go through the   whole book that i had already written   with the eyes of someone living through   covid   and rewrite the pieces that were tone   deaf to a world where we didn't know   we'd be stuck in our houses for that   long   or have everything canceled so then i   got to go man do i actually   it's almost like i got to write a first   draft and then i got to watch to see if   it was actually true   and there were a couple places where i   was like well that isn't true anymore   if i can't write a whole chapter about   flying to europe because who's getting   to do that   europeans and that's it you know like   and so so   i feel i feel that same thing you feel   writing   i just in a in a brand new way that i've   never done before it's almost like i got   to lay that   filter over the whole book and shake it   out   and all the stuff that wasn't true   during covet and after covid   and in the book anymore wow what a   blessing that's so cool   and that's so great even for people   knowing who are gonna get this book   which you all   should get this book for sure obviously   but for people knowing getting the butt   this isn't going to be something that is   like you said tone death to the   situation that we're in it's actually   speaking   straight to the situation that you're in   and so you know you just talked about   going through a hard time and   that's still in your book that sounds   fun so what is your   advice for people who you know are going   through a hard time went through   the worst of coven lost them like these   really hard things   like what's your advice to them and why   would you say like this book is for you   and i think it can encourage you because   of this yeah i mean i think the thing i   learned the most when i watch that movie   inside   out is that joy and sadness are better   together   cool and so and so i think for people   who are really hurting   after covet are in the middle of coven   we aren't after it   sadly yet come lord jesus and set us   free from kovad like   but but for people who are living   through it as we all   are i actually think fun is a little bit   of the medicine we need for the sickness   that our hearts feel   we just need a release and the problem   is   we think i will feel better once i can   fly to fill in the blank   or you know what i'm going to feel   better this weekend because i'm going to   drink as much as i want to drink or i'm   going to eat as much as i want to eat   or the thing i've been seeing if i'm   being real honest with you sadie is   my friends are hooking up in ways they   weren't doing before covent   because they the single people aren't   meeting new people and so they're just   scrolling through their phones and   making decisions in secret   that nobody knows because there's not   accountability because you don't have to   look   the dudes don't have to look each other   in the face they can do whatever they   want in secret and the girls too   and and so there's been all these things   we've run to   in covid because we didn't want to feel   alone or abandoned or sad   and so for our friends who are feeling   any of that or who have run to those   things   i would say you are allowed to feel that   stop trying to medicate that   with things and instead just feel it and   believe yourself   and then go well what really brings me   joy because here's how we figured out   you want to know the quiz i'll give you   the fun quiz   when you got home from school in third   grade on a tuesday   what did you do what did you really do   after school on tuesdays sadie what   would you do when you're a kid   so great i'm trying to think well you   know my mom and dad always made me and   johnny go play outside   yeah and that is actually true like to   this day   whenever i need a break like me and   christian go on a walk or i take the dog   outside   like there's something about just   getting outside and   being in the freshness and the quiet of   louisiana woods so that's right that is   so   interesting it stays with you that thing   you did as a kid   that made you feel wild and free   actually still lives in you   now it doesn't mean so i had do i have   time to tell you a quick story   yes this i was talking to another guy we   were talking about this and i said   okay so tell me what you did after   school and he was like this isn't going   to sound fun blah blah and i was like   okay get all that out of your system now   tell me   and he said i used to get the kids   together in my neighborhood   and we would like be a choir and i would   direct the choir   and i was like that is the sweetest   thing i've ever heard   that is so cool and i was like do you   sing now and he's like getting   teary he's like no i don't why don't i   do that why don't i   why aren't why am i not in a chorus why   am i not you know and so then   because there is something in us that   fun thing the reason i want to say that   when we're talking about   pain is because that thing we're longing   for when we're in pain   um it actually is this thing in us that   you know our   eternity is set in our hearts what we're   really longing for is   to be with jesus what we're really   longing for is eden before everything   was broken   and the truth is we don't get that here   we don't get that here and there was   never a pot of gold at the end of the   rainbow   right there was never a pot of gold yeah   and so we're sad that we can't get to we   always look at a rainbow   i wish we could get to the end and you   never can god never promised the pot of   gold he promised the rainbow   wow and so in your pain find the kind of   fun that is not   chasing a pot of gold but is celebrating   the rainbow the thing you did when you   were a kid   that made you feel alive whether it's   painting playing   uh writing puzzles anything   singing i don't know riding a bike   playing outside the thing you did as a   kid if you will put   30 minutes on your calendar this week   and just label it fun   and you'll go try that thing again   you're going to learn something about   yourself you're either going to love it   or you're not going to love   it and it's going to give you direction   on what happens next yeah preach   i love this annie this is so so good i   feel like people are going to be   so set free from this book and even this   podcast the different things that you   talk on because   like even that simple thing of like   going back i was like what did i do   and it was like it came to my mind like   that that was so cool and you still do   it it's you still do it you do   something about being outside being   outside is always a win   i mean yeah you know one of the things   they tell you you should know this when   you're   about to have a baby is they say when a   kid gets crabby put them in water   you know like when they act crabby put   them in water and the same is true when   we're adults   put us in a swimming pool or put us   outside and it helps it just helps   it does that's so good i love it okay so   you talk about this in the book   the joys of being an amateur yes tell me   about   that yeah you know what's happened to us   and this is   this kind of goes back to your   influencer question a little bit is   we've all kind of been convinced   that you can't try a makeup look or   have a conversation about racial   injustice or   try a sport if you're not a professional   at it so don't say or do anything unless   you're sure you're going to be the best   and that is a concern with cancel   culture right is that if you make a if   you're   trying to learn and grow and you make a   misstep   you're going to get canceled yeah and so   but the joy of being an amateur is   what if we just let ourselves and each   other   be new at something like what if we just   were allowed to not know how to do   everything like so good why when did we   stop   when did i stop saying to you i hope i   didn't say it to you but when did i stop   saying to you like   sadie you're you can't try anything new   you have to only do what you're good at   and it just limits our fun   it puts so much pressure on you i think   it that's because that's the thing like   people   who are even my 23 is like why do i have   to be a professional at 23.   i like i can't be i have so much to   learn i have so much to grow in but when   you think you have to be   that to start that you're never going to   start because the pressure's too high   and sadie i didn't write my first book   until i was 26.   it didn't come out until i was 32 when i   was 23 i was teaching elementary school   i was playing guitar   for fifth graders trying to teach them   how to spell words right like   we never know where our life is going   compared to where we are so   don't make yourself don't take the   pressure off of   i can't post this picture unless it's um   edited perfectly   or i can't tell this story unless it's   worked out just like i thought it would   or i can't try this sport or this craft   or this recipe   until i know i'm going to be good at it   we are losing   so many opportunities at fun by forcing   ourselves to be pros   be an amateur be not perfect at   something and you're going to have   so much more fun i love that and we got   to   do it for each other too we got to start   letting people like yeah you know what   she's not a professional at that   conversation but she's trying   that's what i was going to say like   everybody wants this but it takes   us like actually doing it and cheering   other people on in it too   for this to actually happen it's like   everything you're saying is so practical   everything you're saying is   it preaches it's pretty it's practical   it's what everybody needs it's actually   like a breath of fresh air actually and   honestly   but it just takes us actually listening   and following   through and doing it and yeah like you   said not judging others not canceling   others allowing people the grace to   learn   oh so good i love you it's one of the   things when we're having hard   conversations either   online or in person and you get so   offended i get offended by people   that my first question needs to be tell   me more tell me more about   i don't even have to start yelling if i   want to engage my first thing is like   i'm surprised at what you're saying tell   me more because   if i'm going to be an amateur and learn   from you then i and i also need to give   you grace that you're a learner   that's how i have to walk into these   conversations that are hard online   they're hard to have online so true but   but it's happening   yeah it's so good i was actually at   dinner table with somebody two nights   ago and we have   totally different lives and i knew we   had totally different views and yeah you   kind of tiptoe around those things   and you don't really ask you don't   really dive in and i finally was like   can i ask you a question i just asked   him like   this question that was super   controversial that i knew he   liked yeah like thought believed and i   was like help me understand   what i'm missing because i don't i don't   see it you know   and it was such a mess like our   conversation was so awkward like   we just awkwardly stumbled over words   and didn't really   like get to the whole point but it was a   start   and that conversation was so good that   night   it opened the door for not even that   conversation to get answered but so many   other things and i was like you know   what we need to do this   more like just awkwardly dive into it   awkwardly dive into it if i could make a   t-shirt today just awkwardly dive diving   that relationship you're scared of that   conversation you're scared of   that grad school you're scared to apply   to awkwardly dive into it you will be   fine you will not drown   the front of the shirt you say be an   amateur in the back says awkwardly dive   in   right i love it i'm wearing it okay so i   love   how your subtitle you talk about why you   need a hobby   and i thought that was really cool   because why do you need a hobby and so i   want to ask you   what is your hobby and how does it help   you okay   so i'm still working on getting hobbies   lined up in my life   and but i'll tell you the one and i   don't think they have to last forever   but i'll tell you the one that i've been   uh really working on lately has been   i picked up cross stitching again like   like my grandmother taught me   100 years ago when you said cross   stitching earlier i was like i wonder if   she's   referring to herself yes 100 because you   know what i noticed is i was   watching tv and i was scrolling on my   phone   like why do we double screen it's   unbelievable   and so what i did is i went on etsy and   i found a   pattern from hamilton and it's the three   sisters in hamilton   and they're saying work and they've and   it's so cute and i was like   i can cross stitch that and so i sit so   now i do that when i'm watching tv   or whatever and but the other cool thing   sadie is so we need hobbies because   we need to make space for things like   that we need things that don't involve   our brains   i actually like puzzles too like steph   and sometimes i'll listen to audio books   or listen to podcasts and just   work on with my hands it's just nice   one of the things matt chandler taught   me is if you sabbath   or sorry if you work with your hands   sabbath with your mind   and if you work with your mind sabbath   with your hands   wow right and so we need to now of   course we do some of both because you're   like well i type and i use my brain i   know i know   um people yell me on the internet like   well i'm a mom so what and i'm like stop   stop ripping this apart just picky   but so part of hobbies is you need to   rest your brain and do something with   your hands   or you need to if you're building stuff   every day rest your hands and read a   book and let your brain engage   so cross stitching has been that for me   and you know the other sweet thing is   i've met people in the craft store that   i would have never met in any other way   except we both needed the same yellow   that's so cool right   so hobbies build community that you   don't have in a world where   we want friends who don't believe   everything we believe because we   know we have the right answer and we   want people to know who jesus   is sometimes you can stand up and preach   in the in the aisles of joanne's fabric   and that's fine   but other times you can just meet the   girl by the yellow   and make friends and that's so good   someday believe that that   that interaction will continue to lead   to people knowing who jesus is   i love that that's so good you know it's   funny you talk about the double screen   because   i have to admit i have this terrible   addiction to candy crush the game yes   and how many levels are you uh it's like   like i it's embarrassing i'm in the 900s   so   i'm close to that but this is so funny   so the other day i was like listen   christian's like i know you get annoyed   that i play candy crush   and he was like no i don't and i   realized he doesn't get annoyed i'm   annoyed at myself that i play candy   crush   because i'm like this is annoying i   don't even like that i'm looking at my   screen and it's not   like i'm not like always on it but i do   turn   to that and like if i'm just like want   to just like turn my brain up but i'm   like i need a better hobby   but what i will say is like tennis has   always been my hobby yeah and i always   tell christian it's so weird when i play   tennis it's the only   place like truly that my mind shuts off   like   and it that is so cool that you said   that because i am working and moving my   hands and my body but like my brain has   had so much peace i'm not thinking about   anything it's like my true like   time to be still even though i'm not   being still and so that's so cool i   think that's so important and it is   important to get a hobby that's not also   on your screen yeah and i don't hate   crush i'm not an anti-candy crush i   haven't it does turn your brain off a   little bit too   it turns your brain off i love it on   airplanes but i also wonder so when you   say that to me and you like that   i wonder if you got a deck of cards and   did the same thing but it was in your   hands instead of the blue screen in your   eyes   so true or if you learn i mean you're   about to have a tiny person you could   start working on making   knitting blankets or making little   things   that and laney's about to have a baby   too right so you can do it together   oh my gosh i love it so much yeah y'all   can like learn and so   there is just something what you've   tapped into   with candy crush in what you've if you   and i if we were doing a   coaching a fun coaching no that's why i   i actually was like throwing the candy   crush as bait like   is that a hobby like because i don't   like that it's on the screen but   right but i like that right so what i'm   actually   hearing you say is that you like games   games are fun i know that's part of   y'all's family history   so you love games and and you need your   brain to turn off but you don't mind   still using your hands   you don't need to be asleep so you need   to start making you don't   you don't have to but i if you said what   should i do i'd say   think about things you want to make you   like making things with your hands   making things   and so there's got to be something small   that doesn't matter it doesn't have to   be a huge blanket that lasts forever it   doesn't have to be   like the most beautiful thing ever   you're going to be an amateur at   whatever you do   and don't delete candy crush play it   sometimes too oh trust me   i won't delete it because that is my   that's my plain go-to too   that's where the love started yes me too   the love started like 2012 flying across   the country   yes when i'm flying that's what i do and   somehow i worked my way up to 900.   okay that's so good okay last thing i   want to ask you because obviously the   podcast is that sounds fun your book is   that sounds fun   so you know i and i know this could   probably be a longer story and you can   tell   whatever long short version of it that   you want but   when it where did that all come from   like the podcast   you're like i'm gonna start this podcast   because your podcast has killed it like   by the way just congrats like i love   seeing your instagram who all you're   interviewing   how much fun you're having how much fun   the guests are having it's truly become   such a huge thing and so where did all   that fun start   yeah you know the podcast really started   because a fiction author's like pr team   called me and said   will you interview him and i was like   well yeah but where are we going to   release it   they're like at the time i was like i   have a blog what and i have twitter what   do you want me to do   and they said have you ever thought   about starting a podcast and i said that   sounds fun   hand to hand i said that sounds like and   then went home and i was like that   sounds fun podcast   okay nobody has it so here we go so   that's really how it started but that's   how the best thing start i was an   amateur i didn't know what i was doing   i i just i what i love is i love when my   friends meet my friends   and become friends right so like if you   met someone else here in nashville   and we all went to coffee together and   then y'all got coffee by yourselves   that's a dream to me i love when my   friends become friends   but that's what i get to do now in the   podcast too is introduce my friends   who are making something great a book an   album a recipe whatever   to my friends that are listeners and so   because i called the podcast that it   kind of accidentally set me up as the   expert on fun   and then i was like you know what no one   else is talk people use joy   people use happy people don't say fun   and i   believe in it and so i was like well if   they're going to call me an expert i'm   going to   figure it out so that's where it came   from   that is so good the best things do   happen like that i was saying for us   like   somebody asked me the best piece of   advice i've ever been given i said it   and my mom said   whoa that's good and that's literally   how it started so it's   he's so funny god there's a rabbit trail   like if you follow the holy spirit like   rabbit troll you'll fall into the   coolest thing that's right and that's   what our friends listening   to here is like neither of us had a   massive business plan when we started   this   we had a little inkling of something   that might bring us a good time   and we stepped toward it one time and   then we did it again   and then we did it again and that is the   actual   essence of what sounds fun what sounds   fun is do   do the little thing the little door   that's opened and see if and see if and   see if and see what happens   yeah that's so good i love it andy this   is so good this has been so   fun and i cannot wait for people to be   coached on fun and instructor have fun   be   amateurs and awkwardly dive in that's   right you're the best you're such a good   friend and just such a good human thanks   for being on the podcast   i'm so grateful for you i'm so glad   we're friends thanks for having me   all right welcome back to the good and   bad advice segment the part of the   podcast where   you all love more than the other part   probably probably   probably maybe why because you're in it   maybe i don't know but   maybe i'm just thinking that maybe   you're just going to see some of the   comments   some of the comments he reads his   comments i don't read my comments um   so good and bad advice every time you   get in front of a mic you should   make a fart noise good advice that's   good well instead of doing like   check check one two three why don't you   just do check check   well we just had this conversation that   worked because   like every time he sits down here he   like goes like i'm like   how many times are you like when do you   get to the point where you stop doing   that   i got in trouble last week for doing   that at my friend's rehearsal dinner   yeah that was   totally inappropriate so that was bad   advice but anything else it could be   good enough ooh   this is not getting rid of ice but can i   ask you a question ask me   and i'm asking all of you too sonic ice   or chick-fil-a   ice oh that's a good question i would   say   ba buying in bulk sonics i don't think   you can buy chick-fil-a in bulk   but you can intentionally buy sonic and   bulk but if i'm just gonna drink a drink   i'd rather drink chick-fil-a   me too like sonic ice is where all the   hype's at and i love sonic guys but like   we love yeah it's like really good   the crunch is specifically good   speaking of sonic did you like the movie   sonic   yeah i yes of course i do   all right we have to get to this okay   sorry all right good amount of eyes   let's see   don't be sad it's such a waste of time   dang   brutal man i think that's bad   yeah advice because there's definitely   time in the place to mourn you   you taught me this too because i used to   like not want to cry because i was like   crying sad why would i cry let's just   get past it   and christian's like you need to feel   that like you're like tears are a good   thing   like also that movie uh the shack like   when it talks about the tears and how   like   the holy spirit like collected all the   tears and it was just so sweet   but yeah you really taught me a lot   about that and now i i cry   at the appropriate times and it helps   because it   helps you actually move forward yeah and   i think and i think that idea of like   sadness can like not be a sign of like   masculinity you know because i think a   lot of people who like want to be   masculine want to be a man   don't sad they don't they don't cry   about it they don't say they don't they   don't ask   whatever they want to do because because   of something in their life but i think   it's completely   okay to cry and still be a man look at   king david the dude was a beast   yeah baby i love that that is so good   all right let's see   sushi is great you should try it   yeah sushi's one of my favorite food do   you kill him you can crush   i can crush sushi me too talking like   four rolls is like child's play   yeah that that might not even be good   for you   i actually read something this morning   on my glorify app that's actually a   really good advice too   oh bring it you want to hear it yeah you   have no authority   where you have no love sheesh oh   that is good how where you have   no love that's so good give that a heart   i give it a heart christian i both have   to glorify you   and they send you a piece of advice   every day like   it starts with that's a quote and it's   always so good that one was particularly   it's always just little nuggets of gold   he makes fun of me for saying nuggets   that's not weird that's not   weird okay finally tell us if you like   chick-fil-a or sonic eyes   let me know if say that is nuggets of   gold is   weird or not but chick-fil-a actually   does have nuggets of gold   they're legit valid salad   i love you check out chick-fil-a today   you   happy new year let's go   iphone y'all i am so excited   who's excited that we are kicking off   the new year together   right it's amazing most importantly   kicking it off   in the name of jesus y'all this is   beautiful this is amazing this is the   hope   we've been waiting for to just claim the   name of jesus over   a crazy year so i just want to start it   off by reading passions verse it's been   the foundational verse for passion since   they started   it's isaiah 26 8 and it says this yes   lord walking in the way of your truth we   wait   eagerly for you for your name and your   renown   are the desire of our soul how many of   you agree with that   that the name of jesus is the desire   of our soul y'all can go ahead and take   your seat   that is my heart's cry that is my prayer   that the name of jesus would be lifted   up that his renown   would be the desire of this generation's   soul you know we talk about this a lot   we're always like guys let's make jesus   famous   has anybody ever said that like we gotta   make jesus famous   that's like such a hype thing we say at   conferences and you guys already know   that   this but i just want to point out the   fact that jesus is like   so famous he already is like   literally google the most famous person   who ever lived and the first person it   says is   jesus jesus is a very famous person   he has been drawing crowds for over 2   000 years   there's like over hundreds of thousands   of people literally gathered   today because of the name of jesus and   fame just simply means to be known and   so jesus is   very very very very very famous but i   agree we should always continue to make   the name of jesus famous but i also want   to point out that not only   is jesus currently famous not only is   jesus going to continue to be   famous but something cool i've been   reading is that jesus actually   was famous like when he lived his life   on earth he was a   famous person so i want us to read mark   chapter 6 because it gives a really good   idea of this   verse 53 when they crossed over they   came to the land of ganester and moored   to the shore   and when they got out of the boat the   people immediately   recognized him and they ran about the   whole region and began to bring sick   people on their beds to wherever they   heard he was   and wherever he came in villages cities   or countryside they laid the sick in the   marketplaces and implored him   that they just might even touch the   fringe of his garment   get this and as many as that touch the   fringe of that garment we're made well   so we see right here jesus was famous   they immediately recognized him   they ran to him in cities in villages   and countrysides   everybody that heard the name of jesus   wanted to be where jesus was   they wanted to touch the fringe of his   garment   i remember uh the first time i went to a   taylor swift concert   i got word that t swift was going to run   from stage a to stage b   at some point in the concert so all of   my friends you know we're getting in the   row and i'm like hey guys you know i'll   be the selfless one i'll take the aisle   row you know   really just perfectly positioning myself   because i knew when t swift ran down i   was gonna like reach out and like touch   the fringe of that garment   like for some reason when people are   famous we want to touch them we're   gravitated to them   we recognize them we want to draw a   crowd around them   and jesus was the same type of way   everybody flocked   to jesus for a very good reason i just   want to point this out in the church   that fame is not a bad thing fame's not   a bad thing i think sometimes fan gets a   bad rap   but fame's not a bad thing jesus was   famous and he calls   us to be the light of the world and he   says don't be the kind of light   that you light a lamp and like put it   under a stand no no put it on top of the   sand   so it can light up the whole house so   there's nothing wrong with being known   especially not for the sake of jesus   name fame is not a bad thing   but i do think it gets a bad rap for a   couple reasons   one kristen cain said this the first   passion i went to and it changed my life   this is such a good point she said that   fame can be a bad thing when you let the   spotlight that's shining on you shine   brighter than the spotlight coming from   within you   because that spotlight will crush you   that's very true fame is   bad for that reason number two fame gets   a bad rap i think it's because we're not   actually meant to get the glory   like jesus should be famous he deserves   the glory   we're not created for glory we're   created to give glory to our creator   so that's a bad rap and that's a bad   thing   but the last thing i really want to land   on is that fame and talk to you about is   that fame   gets a bad rap because of the motive   behind fame   there's an article that the new york   times did this is so interesting it's   called the fame motive   and they surveyed adults in china and in   germany   and i gotta say if they did this in   america with millennials and gen z i   think we'd see bigger numbers   but even this is shocking over 40   of the people they surveyed said this   that they are just   currently waiting on their 15 minutes of   fame to hit because they know they will   be famous one day   40 of these adults in 2006   they surveyed 18 to 25 year olds and if   they would have done this now i think it   also would have been a lot larger   but 51 of 18 to 25 year olds in 2006   said   that fame is either the first or second   most important life goal to their   generation   fame so they asked a girl that was in   this survey they said   what is it about fame why does your   generation   want to be famous so bad she very   honestly answered and she said this well   because we want to be loved like we want   to know we're loved   we want to know we're wanted we want to   know that somebody cares about us   we want to know that somebody notices us   she even said even if it's just like   what i had for lunch i just wish people   would care   and she said but isn't that what we all   want   and you know i agree with her i think   she's right and the fact that we all do   want to be wanted   and we all do want to be loved and we   all want to know that we're cared for   and we all want to know that we're   noticed that's not a bad thing   the bad thing and the problem is that we   have a generation   searching for that through fame   and i can tell you from personal   experience thank   you that followers will never get you   that if you want to feel wanted   and loved and accepted and cared for and   all these things you will not find it   through fame   we have a generation looking for things   through followers that you can only get   from the one whom we're following jesus   christ   we have a generation waiting to feel the   sense of love waiting to feel the sense   of somebody cares about   waiting to feel wanted by people   gathering up to them   instead of just gathering behind the   king of kings and knowing that you're   wanted   knowing that you're loved knowing that   you're accepted because of what he's   already done for you   we've got to stop obsessing over who is   following us   and obsessing over the one that we're   following   i think the greatest revelation i've had   in my life one up is this   is that i do not need followers to know   that i'm wanted   i know i am wanted because the one i am   following   love me enough to come down to this   earth and take my sins to the cross   i don't need followers to know that i'm   liked   i know i'm loved because the one i'm   following love me enough to do that   i don't need a following to know someone   cares about me   i know i'm following a god who knows the   very number of hairs on my head   i don't need a following to know that   somebody notices me   somebody accepts me i know who i'm   following said it is finished at the   cross your sins are forgiven   you're accepted you're loved you're   wanted   and i could have searched my whole life   to find that in following but i never   would have   i never would have would have left me   empty but the one who i'm following   wow i found it all in him and i can tell   you there's only one   famous person who's ever lived that when   you touch the fringe of their garment   you're healed   no other garment will heal you no other   person can truly change you from death   to life but jesus christ can   you know i remember whenever i was in   pre-k and   the lion leader was a really big deal in   pre-k i don't know if you guys remember   that but it was a major deal and i just   remember   that you were only the line leader based   off of your last name but everybody got   a chance to be the line leader   and it was so epic because you know you   got to lead the class and everybody   would sing the song we're following the   leader the leader the leader   following the leader wherever they may   go and i truly remember it being like   the worst day of the year   when the worst kid in the class was the   line leader like   the most annoying the most frustrating   the guy that never listened and i like   can tell you that i actually remember   that because i remember his name i will   not say it but i remember that really   frustrating me   because he was the line leader and i had   to stand in that line and be like   we're following the leader leader   wherever they may go   and like i don't want to follow you like   what no i don't want to follow you you   are not leading us in a good direction   what   are you worthy of leading this class for   you have been terrible all year long   but he was the line leader and i started   to think about that and i was like you   know what i think that we cared a lot   more   and we're way more concerned with who we   were following when we were in pre-k   than we do now oh we'll follow anybody   if they're the it person we'll follow   anybody if it's their 15 minutes of fame   if it's their turn to lead oh they're   tick tock famous we'll follow them   they're the it couple on instagram   we'll follow them sure they're leading   us in no direction we want to go   sure they're leading us down a very   negative path   sure we feel more insecure than we ever   felt sure we feel   tempted to wear clothes that we know do   not represent the body of christ   well sure it's leading us down a road of   pornography but hey   we're following the leader wherever they   may go   and i just want to tell you we have to   stop   following the leader based on whose 15   minutes of fame is height   because whoever is leading is   influencing your life   if you're following somebody they are   influencing you one way or another   and that's why we have a generation that   looks more like the instagram   influencers than jesus christ because   we're following them first   instead of jesus christ first i don't   have interest in following anybody who's   not leading me in the direction i want   to go   and we need to take that really   seriously jesus christ says this   he said i am leading you to one place i   am leading you to the father   and no one gets to the father except   through me i am the way   i am the truth i am the life and no one   gets to the father except through me so   if you're thinking more about eternity   than 15 minutes   you should start thinking about truly   following jesus first   because he's the only way to the father   and it would be a shame if we spent more   time   spending more time thinking about our 15   minutes of fame to hit   than where we will spend eternity and we   spent more time following people leading   us in past that we do not have any   interest in going down   than following the word of god people   ask me all the time how do you how do i   grow my platform how do i grow my   following   and clearly i don't have much interest   in talking about that i'd rather talk to   you about how you follow jesus   and i want to share with you and mark   what he said to a crowd   this is what jesus said to a crowd he   said and calling the crowd to him   to him with his disciples he said this   if anyone would come after me   if anyone would follow me let him deny   himself   take up his cross and follow me for what   does it profit a man to gain the whole   world   and forfeit his soul   jesus said to follow me you have to deny   yourself   take up your cross that's how you follow   me   it's notice it's totally opposite than   the fame motive   it's not about yourself i read this one   time that said   when jesus said that that day you have   to understand that everybody there   knew what that meant when he said take   up your cross they knew that meant   crucifixion   that meant you don't know you can't save   yourself   that was not about self promotion or   any affirmation it was you can't save   yourself and you   need a savior so you should deny   yourself   and follow him because he can save you   and so i just want to say to y'all as a   generation if i think if we realize   anything this year it's crazy because   i've still seen people search for this   idea of fame but i want us to stop that   search and just start following god   because if we need anything after this   stretch we   need a savior we can't save ourselves   we can't put our hope in our self we   can't put our faith in our self   you don't want to do that because you   know at the end of the day you need   something greater to put your hope in   something greater to put your faith in   something greater who can actually   save you who can actually give you hope   beyond this world   and so i just hope that you take that   word today and make those simple changes   in your life   deny yourself stop following the pattern   of this world and follow   jesus christ the only way the only truth   the only life to the father i want to   pray for us tonight because the night's   just getting started   and we're going to hear so much but   right now i just wanted to clear off the   bat   that jesus is famous he was famous and   he's the only one   deserving of the glory that we give   anyone god we thank you so much   for what you're gonna do tonight what   you're gonna do   closing this year and starting a new   year god we just believe   god for big things because you are a big   god   god we believe even if nothing changes   or if things keep changing it gets worse   god that you remain the same   and that you are good you are who we put   our hope in you are who we put our faith   in   god it is for your name and your renown   we do everything we do   i pray as a generation we would stop   following   others and stop obsessing over our   following we would deny that   lay that down and we would follow you   god   straight to the father we love you we   praise you   and we glorify your name tonight it's in   your name we pray amen   i love doing this and it's so crazy how   long it took us to finally do this so   i know i was really good you had covered   i had   covers lord jesus i don't know   crazy

were probably   distracted by that and i was like   [Laughter]   that's so fun i'm always wondering like   can we not   make it a little better like i   understand the symbolism   that it's supposed to be like a bitter   like sorrowful thing   but if we could just get a little just a   saltine cracker   it would go a long ways i am 100 agree i   want a secret we should have because we   were sitting there   choking our money it was so funny like   christian is still talking about that   because people be like that was the most   beautiful moment and it was it was great   but secretly

expecting our first not our fourth   and a little girl but   we're stoked that's awesome congrats   excited for you guys thank you yeah   thank you you too   well let's get into it what is the best   piece of advice   that you've ever been given the very   best   this is a difficult question but i love   that you ask it   um i had to really go through my mental   file   but i went back to the years before   my band was signed and we played at a   church in baytown texas   where leland and jack mourin's parents   pastor and we went over to their house   and you know it was our 15 passenger van   and all that and um   they were just so kind to us but   leland's mom   is this texas lady like   the quintessential texas woman and she   said   tauren let me tell you something you   gotta keep   your head small your heart   big and your eyes open wow   and that always stuck with me throughout   my whole journey   humility compassion and vision   and uh yeah good good stuff from mama   cindy   that's so good head small heart big   eyes open i love that it's like uh   what is it clear as full heart can't   lose that that reminds me yeah   that is so good i love that it's such   good advice um   so i recently saw you at passion which   was so awesome fashion was incredible   it was awesome great job ah thank you   to youtube you guys did amazing thank   you the whole night was insane it was so   good and i loved   y'all coming in at the end singing your   new song oh god's children um   tim kind of talked about how a little   bit of the process of why   but can you kind of tell us that story   of why y'all wrote the song and where   that idea came from   yeah well my wife was talking about   human trafficking a lot over the last   few months and she hadn't really before   so i was paying attention   and but i was also like yeah i know this   is an issue   uh it's been around for a long time but   i'm very busy doing other things   and then she sent me one particular   video   and i watched it and there was no   way to move forward   in the rest of my everyday life without   trying to make some type of difference   and uh it's one of those things where   the problem is so   big you know 40 million   men women and children and sex slavery   and the human trafficking system   and sometimes when something is so big   it's hard to get your head around it's   like well how do i get my hands around   it   and uh i was praying and   over the course of a couple weeks and i   saw that tim   was posting a lot on social media   about their human trafficking their   anti-human trafficking efforts   and i didn't know that he was as   involved   in that as he was so i was like oh   that's cool   tim's you know what a guy not only is he   hosting   proms all over the world for   kids with special needs but now he's   doing this and   i was like i need to do something like   that i need to start a movement i need   to start an organization   so i was praying about that and then i   woke up one morning and it had to just   be the lord speaking to me to let me see   past my ego   that you don't have to start your own   fight   you can join tim's that's great so i was   like   okay i think so many times our first   pivot is like   i have to start my own thing yeah when   so much more happens in collaboration   and so i hit tim and i'm like hey bro my   wife and i   we want to help god's put this on our   heart what can we do   and he said dude write a song wow and i   i was like why didn't i think of that   you know   sometimes what we can offer were so   it's what we see last but that's that's   kind of the genesis of it   that's so good that's so cool i love   that because you're right like you put   this pressure on yourself that you have   to start something you have to do   something   and then a lot of times when you think   you have to start you actually never end   up doing anything   because right it's so overwhelming but   there are so many people   doing the things out there that you can   just partner with or collaborate with or   even give to so   practically for everyone listening how   can we help out because i love how you   said like i knew i need to do something   and i saw it on tim's   instagram so maybe this is that moment   for people who are listening like i know   i need to do something   what can they do absolutely well the   cool thing is   with the song it's available on every   streaming platform that there is   wherever   you like to listen to music you can   listen to the song   all god's children and 100 of the   proceeds   from the streams and the merch of this   song are going to   fuel rescue missions through the tim   tebow foundation   so streams break chains that's good   and uh i'm i'm really excited that   people   who feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of   this   it's as easy as getting in your car and   turning on your phone   or turning on youtube we can we can do   something to make a difference together   so cool everybody can do that so go get   the song   i got structure and i'm sure you can get   it anywhere where you can get songs   it says so incredible so i want to ask   you um i love   what you're talking about about just   like joining something that someone else   is doing but you're you're doing a lot   yourself like   you are an artist you also preach a lot   which you're incredible at both   you have a family you do so many things   i'm sure we don't know about   i know you've done stuff in secular   world and church world with music and   just all kinds of different things   was there ever a time in your life that   you limited god   to what you could do and if so   how did you break pasta yeah well i   think that is the constant   tension um especially as you do   more and more there is a tendency to   drift toward   self-reliance and thinking that   all this stuff came from me but what i'm   i'm trying to always remind myself that   my uh my efforts   are not really the key i do have to be   engaged and participate   but it's really god's faithfulness   that delivers the results it's good   and so i've been trying to remind myself   even as   the year we had last year and stepping   into this year that   my responsibility is movement i need to   have my hands engaged i need to have my   heart engaged but god's job   is fulfillment that he's going to bring   the right things to pass   in the right season and what i've   struggled with   sadie is i'll look at   my future and all the things that i want   to do   and i'll think of all of the things   that i'm going to need to fulfill those   things   and i'll take inventory of my life right   now and be like well i don't have that   i don't have those skills i don't have   that experience how am i ever going to   do that   neglecting the fact that   all i need is what i have   for the season that i'm in right now   and that god is the one that produces   the fruit   in its season you know it's that   whole scripture of don't grow weary and   well doing for   in due season you will reap a harvest if   you don't faint   there is a season for what needs to be   produced in our lives   and if we stay connected to the vine   that's just going to happen naturally   i'm so good   i'm always fighting that because it's so   easy to to drift into the self   like sufficiency right you know   oh for sure same it was actually cool   you said that because this morning um   we were talking my team was all here and   we have a new girl today and we were   telling her   you know just whatever god puts inside   of you just believe that   you know he can do it through you and   it's kind of about like your job is to   move   that movement his job is the fulfillment   and if it's a god thing that will happen   and we were telling her like   yeah you come in here and you might see   this podcast mic and the   camera crew and this is a legit thing   happening but   two years ago whenever i was sitting   there with only two team members and i   said we should start a podcast and none   of us had any idea what we were doing we   had no equipment we didn't have a   microphone carrot nothing   and we're just like yeah let's look into   that you know and now we're here and so   it's sometimes god puts a little seed in   your heart i remember there's this verse   um   ecclesiastes 11 talks about it and it   talks about how like   you know you can look at the the cloud   sometimes and you know it's gonna rain   this this is obviously not exactly what   it says but this is kind of like   an an idea it says you can look at a   cloud and you can know it's gonna rain   you can see a tree   falling and know that that's where it's   gonna lie it says but there are some   things that you will not understand   how it happens like the way that a baby   is formed in a mother's womb it talks   about how like those are things that we   don't know like god is   clearly doing something that we can't   wrap our head around but then   it says um but continue to sow your seed   in the morning and don't be idle with   your hand in the evening   and that is like stuck with me for so   long because it's like there are some   things in life you can see this might   happen because this happened but there   are other things in life that you don't   know you   have to trust god and god's gonna blow   your expectations but that doesn't mean   you stop   working it doesn't mean you stop sowing   your seed and then don't be idle with   your hands because you could think it's   gonna happen just like this and god's   like   actually reverse reverse is gonna happen   like this   so that's such good advice and i think   when you don't limit god to what he can   do you do a lot more like for you   you know you're doing so many things and   and you don't   underestimate it i love what you said   about seed because   honestly if the bible talks a lot about   seed   but there is nothing exciting about seed   like the most boring i mean   i'm not going out and just looking for   seeds   okay maybe there are people out there   that's your thing i respect it okay   but there's nothing really exciting   about seed   but faith doesn't just see the seed for   what it is now   it sees what it can become it's great   and when you put seed in the right soil   it grows   into something more than you can imagine   and we should never disqualify   our gifts our story our potential   because it just looks like seed we   shouldn't disqualify our prayers   because they seem small when we're   praying them because they are not yet   what they're going to be when god   fulfills them yeah   so even though the seed isn't super cool   or fun   don't underestimate what god can do with   it so good i love that   i heard mike todd talk about seeds one   time and he was talking about how like   you have to dig in the ground and bury   the seed and that's the same thing you   do with death like   you dig in the ground and you bury the   person but the same place with the sea   where it looks like death is like where   destiny begins i was like that's so   that's right   well people wanted to know they wanted   you to bring it all the way back to   what made you pursue music and what did   that uh   look like the very the very beginning   way back   yeah well i started singing in church   when i was   nine that's when my family started going   to church   my parents separated when i was young   and that sent my dad on a whole faith   journey   and which introduced him to my stepmom   and uh so he changed the whole   trajectory of   my life and our kids and their kids   um by his decision to follow jesus but i   started singing in the church choir   and i i loved it uh when i was   16 i started playing piano and leading   worship in our youth ministry   and uh it's kind of funny because my   youth pastor   who was also my uncle was like tauren   you're a great singer you're doing good   leading worship but you really need to   know how to play an   instrument so i'm like okay so   my dad had keyboards and stuff so i i   was learning how to play   the keyboard but i couldn't learn the   songs fast enough   for the services so i would just write   my own songs because no one knows if   you're messing up your own song   so it's like no that's how it was   supposed to be   so uh that's how i started songwriting   and i loved that but then i got   really invested into the ministry side   of   student ministry and leading worship   where   most days after school i would be coming   up to the church   setting up for our wednesday night youth   services getting the stage right and   this was when   like you decorated stages without   budgets for   lights and stuff so we would have like   the   alley look with garbage cans tipped over   and trash and construction and   all that stuff but i i just love the   creative   side of all that it was an outlet for me   and   seeing my friends come from school i   went to public school   seeing them come and be like   wow this is like the coolest thing that   we've been to   this is and i saw it affect them and   change their hearts and even to this day   i'm talking with friends from high   school   that were impacted from those years   and i just fell in love with the   ministry side so that led me to   bible college i went to bible college   for three years and majored in theology   i minored in music   wow and while i was there i was writing   songs   and the college every year put out an   album   so they got recorded and i was like   it was the first time i was hearing my   music not just on the   piano or the guitar but fully produced   and   people singing and singing it in church   it's just amazing so it's awesome   yeah that's kind of how all that started   i love it   i would never forget the first time i   heard hills and valleys   and me and laney my best friend we were   like this is so good and we listened to   it like a hundred times   and it was so funny um so at the time   lainey and i had just heard it we were   like loved it and then right   soon after there was an award show and   you know they kind of have your seats   where you're gonna sit   so me and lane go sit down and then you   and your wife are behind us and we're   like   oh my god that's sorry we were   starstruck i'm not kidding we were so   bummed we're like that's hilarious we're   so excited   um and people obviously went down to   hills and valleys   in your own life so somebody said how do   you personally keep pursuing god through   the hills and valleys of of your life   and   obviously that song is so good but it   has so much meaning behind it   yeah oh man   to keep it brief you know i was   we have all experienced the highs   and in the lows of life i know i   certainly   have um and i know people have   experienced a lot more than me   but just with you know my parents   um when my wife and i got married   people were upset that we had an   interracial marriage   and uh the church that my wife's   dad pastors had many many families leave   the church   wow when we got married and in the midst   of that   when we're getting married it's our   first year of marriage should be   the most amazing time of our lives   and we're going through the church   turmoil and then my father-in-law was   diagnosed with leukemia   and so that's actually the season   that that song really started stirring   and it   it grew over years and   you know i've realized that there   are things that grow and   valleys that do not grow on mountaintops   wow that god actually does some of his   best work in our darkest places   and i love how the scripture paints the   picture of jesus   as the bride and morning star he is   high and above it all but   in that same set of scriptures it says   that he's also the lily   of the valley that he's not just high   above and away from it all he's actually   in our darkest places growing beautiful   things and so god is not just the god   of the mountaintops and the hills   and the successes and the triumphs he is   the god of   our struggles our disappointments our   fractured places and   he can be trusted because he is with us   in and through it all and   that's really the heart behind hills and   valleys it's reminding people   that life is going to happen   and there is going to be some very tough   stuff that we will all encounter but the   promise   of jesus and the   the promise of his presence   lets us know that there will never be a   day that we have to encounter   any of it alone yep and and that's the   heart   it's beautiful well thanks for sharing   that that's such a good message and i   love how you said that   that song kind of started stirring in   you years before the song ever came out   and a really hard time of your life and   then   years later you put out the song and   it's huge and everybody loves it and   relates to it because we've all had our   heels and valleys and we've seen god in   them   what what do you what would you say to   people because i think our generation   has this uh struggle where we like to   put everything out really fast   and we like for things to happen really   fast but sometimes things just don't   happen like that   sometimes and a lot of times they don't   need to happen like that   so what's your advice on you know   letting something just sit for a little   while before it goes   before it goes out yeah well i   that's a great great observation to   bring up   john mayer actually said that   you know the problem with today's   um young musicians is we write a song   and we think we have to post it on   youtube   immediately like i literally   just wrote it and now it has to go up on   social media   and it kind of kills the developmental   process because he was talking about you   know   the years and years and years it was   just him in his room   with his guitar writing hundreds and   hundreds and hundreds of songs   and practicing and practicing and   practicing   i think that good things   take time good   things take time   jesus does very few instantaneous   miracles   in scripture he does a few   sometimes suddenly happens we we love   that scripture in acts   and suddenly there came a sound from   heaven as of a rushing mighty wind   that was the fulfillment of an ancient   promise that unfolded from generation   to generation to generation the suddenly   took a   very long time to set up   wow and often that that's just how   god operates when you look at the   creation of the world   we serve a god who could breathe it into   existence   who could think into existence who could   do it all in one day   but on day one it was evening   and it was morning and day two   god created and it was evening and it   was morning   day three day four   why because good things   take time it's great so   and i'll add to that   can you celebrate that it's good   before it's done wow preach   because god called every day   good even though it wasn't the   fulfillment   of the full vision that was in his heart   so good   he was able to end that day and look   around and be like man   i know i still got fish to put in this   water   and i still know i got people to put on   this   land but if i'm just looking at the   clouds and the oceans   this is good so great and in our lives   we have to be able to look at   man i don't quite have the relationships   i want to have   it's not quite where i want it to be   but it's good right now that is   yeah so anyways i'm like preach take   like we just went to church like   that is so good i've never thought about   it like that that   he was able to say it was good before it   was done   uh so many people need to hear that like   if you're listening to the podcast   stop for a minute and just think about   the things in your life that might not   be   done yet or that you're putting pressure   to come out now or be   wherever you think you should be   whenever you know   whatever your expectation was for this   season or this year of your life   and just let god work where you're at   that is   good turn i love that uh lastly i want   to talk to you about the song known   because that is christian and i song   come on so we got engaged it was a song   we our first dance at our wedding   and it just meant so much to us because   when christian and i   started dating i had dated other people   before he had dated other people before   and um i felt like the word like love   would come out like so   soon in relationships and that's because   y'all were dating people in like second   grade and third grade and then you all   got married   well that's true that's that's a valid   that's valid   love would come out and i would be like   there's just like i feel like you don't   know me but then i would feel like well   now i don't even want to tell you   like all the things that are really me   because then what if you don't still   love me but this is a backwards concept   so i remember when christian and i   started dating i told him   like i do not want you to tell me that   you love me until you know me   and i don't want to tell you i know   until i love you until i know you   and of course you're always going to   continue to get to know someone and   there's a lot to get to know and i'm   still getting to know christian and   forever will be but the core   of wanting to truly know him and   like be known by him was super important   to me before i said i love you because i   love you   i think when you know that you're known   it takes the pressure off of   feeling like you have to be something   other than yourself and i think in the   day and age that we live in especially   with social media   you're liked by a lot of people and   you're not known by any of them you know   you're seen you're acknowledged but   you're not truly like   known and so i think the song and the   words are so crucial for us to hear   where did that come from in your own   life that you   felt the need to write this song and   what does that mean   to you well there's a quote   that stopped me in my tracks by timothy   keller   and it said to be loved but not known   is comforting but it's superficial you   know this you've posted this before   to be known and not loved is our   greatest fear   but to be fully known this is so good   and truly loved is what it means to be   loved by god so good   i mean there is not a better   encapsulation   of the gospel to me than those   words right there um   and i was i am that like   not to invoke the enneagram here no i   love it   but i normally do ask people so please   share your idea   i i am a three what's   up um so you know what i'm saying and   so it's a lot of performance achievement   image driven image conscious type   things and you know   it's it's hard to love me   with all of my dysfunction but that's   actually the beautiful thing about jesus   is that he didn't die for the image that   we project   he died for who we really are so   before anyone knew me before anyone   liked me before anyone sang my   songs before anybody invited me anywhere   jesus invited me in he knew me he saw me   he   loved me he treasured me and   that just demands the scripture says   it's just a reasonable response   to worship and to live in this place of   worship and   you know my wife and i our story is   pretty cool too   and i always tell people god use my wife   as the greatest expression of god's   grace   in my life to let me know   that i didn't have to be anything more   than what i was   that i could bring all of my failure and   all my dysfunction and all of my broken   pieces that i'm still   trying to make sense of and they are   covered in grace   it's beautiful and uh that's that's the   heart of that song and i'll i'll speak   to the thing too that   you know our generation and the   generation coming up after me   we have really bought into the lie that   it is better   to be well known than to be known well   and if you're evaluating them on a scale   of fame versus intimacy   the intimacy is so much more valuable   than people celebrating you or knowing   your name or you getting a certain   amount of followers   or fill in the blank that the real   treasure is to have people that have   been given permission   to get inside of your heart and   connecting in a deeper way and in a   deeper place   and it's it's something you can't   replace with anything else spend your   whole life trying   come on so good you know right after you   were   just preaching about the good thing i   was like should i ask him one more   question because he just nailed that   and i'm glad i did because you you just   know it like you just preach and   it's so cool because it's an overflow of   who you are and the scripture that you   know and   the um even the family that you have and   you can tell that all comes from such a   genuine place so thank you for sharing   your heart your advice your stories with   us of course it was so good   everybody go get all god's children help   out um   um i guess really by just listening to   the song that is a   practical easy way to help out so   everybody go listen to son turn again   thank you so   so much it's been so fun talking thank   you thank you for having me on          all right drum roll please   welcome back to the segment of the   podcast   where are we talking about good or bad   advice i don't know when all of a sudden   i just felt like i needed to talk about   welcome back to this   segment of the podcast where is that   from oh you know what it's from   veggie tells no like like   like the time of the hour when larry   sings a silly song that's   literally what i'm channeling right now   i hope y'all can connect with that   because i   i i did watch aussie tales but i've   noticed that this just felt like a   fulfillment of my childhood dream   to say something like that okay really   happy about it   anyways i'm moving on we're not gonna   dwell on the moment all right   christian good and bad advice let's hear   it always choose to love others first   great advice like the best advice you   can give because jesus said   that's one of the top two commandments   that jesus gave us love your neighbors   yourself   yeah boom love it girl with all your   heart soul mind and strength   can't go wrong with that so love that   all right let's see be wherever your   feet are   don't live in the past and or the   present that's good advice   i know that sometimes i can look at my   life in moments that i'm   either hopeful for the future or   dwelling in the past i can kind of lose   sight of where i'm at now   um so i think that's really good advice   yeah i love being in the present moment   i love being here right now on this   podcast   me too my feet are down on this rug i'm   loving it   i'm not thinking about whatever i'm   doing later   what i'm doing yesterday i feel content   i feel good for happy   i love that no i agree and it's hard to   do that at times it's so easy to look to   the future or dwell in the past   but when you can surrender the pain of   the past   or even the highs of the past and look   for and also look forward to the future   or not you know spend your whole life   anticipating the future and just be   in the moment i think that's whenever   you truly start living   yeah it's even like us now with like you   know our daughter like i'm so hopeful   for the future of that but i'm also like   just so content now with where we're at   yeah   and being excited yeah that's so sweet   like this is such a good season it's   such a sweet season   yeah and uh what's preparing us for the   next yeah it's praying for   the next one everything in life is like   that it's always preparing you for the   next so   every stage of it is important we're   just in the season we're not having to   pivot   christian christian and my dad always   make fun of all of our church worlds   worlds our church words that we say like   season   and pivot and i can't think i mean they   come every year there's going to be   this year i can't wait for the 2021   church word of the year   let's do it to the next question all   right stress is a choice   hmm i don't know that's interesting   because   i don't know that it's a choice because   if it was a choice i don't think i would   choose it   but wow that that was like just another   realm of like wisdom   well it's true because i would not   choose to be stressed but i often times   feel stressed so i don't think it's a   choice   yeah that's true is it a choice to   choose not to be stressed perhaps   yeah it's a choice to like it's a choice   to like how you want to approach that   yeah sometimes i'm stressed i can either   like shut down or if i'm stressed i can   be like okay let's do it let's get it   done   yeah there is a choice that comes in the   midst of stress to say i'm going to   no longer be stressed and choose to   trust god   but i think getting to the point of   stress is not always a choice sometimes   life happens and throws you a curveball   and sometimes you get stressed and then   in that moment you have a choice to get   out of it yeah   i was actually just about to say word   for word for word   where are you i was yeah yeah i know you   are that was so good that was good   thanks for saying   good and bye bye so what's good podcast   instagram and on   the ella sister app we love you guys and   look forward to seeing more          yup   you   all right   welcome to the podcast i guess ben   you've been on before   but jess this is your first time so   so excited to have both of you here   um y'all are in a crazy exciting season   right   oh yeah it's definitely crazy but it's   been really exciting and fun too   it's awesome so engage you just moved to   colorado   all the transition happening so i know   i've seen you post on instagram about   dress shopping but have you found   the dress i found the dress that's   awesome   i'm like not showing anyone so ben's mom   and my mom are the only ones that have   seen it which makes it really fun too i   love that that's awesome see i wish i   would have done that   i could not help myself i was like   showing the girl lululemon who was like   helping me out i was like do you want to   see like   terrible like the only person who hadn't   seen it was like christian   um i love that that's awesome what was   your experience like like picking up the   dress did you know whenever you got it   or were you like in between a few   honestly i like i mean i don't know   about you but i had an image in my brain   of what i wanted and i put it on and i   hated it yep   so then i was like well i guess i'll   just try on everything so i tried   literally every style dress and then the   one i put on i was like oh no this is it   and then we made a couple changes to it   but i don't even have photos of it on my   phone because i know i'd be that same   way and show it to every single person   it's too hard you can't have the picture   that's that's so funny that's how my   sister is she just got engaged   she like had the dress that she knew she   wanted   and she tried it on and she was like i   don't like this at all like   the one that she said she would never   wear like the type that she would never   wear is the one she got   it's so funny yeah yeah so that's   awesome   i think wedding dress shopping is like i   feel like sometimes it's similar to your   personality too which is always really   funny to see   um ben are you excited for jess to   finally be in colorado   oh my gosh it's been awesome yeah we did   long distance for two and a half years   dang   so and like long distance long distance   like we would go weeks without seeing   each other   okay yeah i remember that so yeah it was   tough so having her   in colorado now is really great   for every reason like we're able to   actually like spend time together or do   nothing together   or go off and do our own things when   we're in the same city like it's been   it's awesome just a really positive   thing oh i love that that's so great   christian and i were the same way we did   long distance our whole   dating life and engaged i guess so we   didn't actually live in the same place   till we got married   and it was so fun though like once we   were together we were like this is the   greatest thing ever   so i'm so excited for y'all to step into   that   um well we'll get to the question of the   podcast   which is what is the best piece of   advice you've ever been given and ben i   know you've kind of already told us   at one point one of your good pieces of   advice but if you have another one   please share it with us and i'd love to   hear from both of y'all   yeah well should we do it so like   when i look at advice i think of like is   should it be love   themed wedding themed relationship   themed or like life themed dang you're   stacked most people are like let me   think you're like well i have like six   um okay let's go love theme for the sake   of the season y'all are in   if you have one if you have one ready   for that   yeah so like i it's weird i don't   remember a lot in life   uh in fact i forget most of the stuff   that happens however   like i can like compartmentalize these   little pockets in my life   and so when it comes to advice or words   of encouragement then what like i have   different   the different sectors stick with me and   when it comes to love   um i i think the best advice which is   so unromantic but it's uh love   is a commitment um that's good   it's one that you choose to do every   morning you choose to do every night you   choose to do it every second at with   every breath   is that you choose to love which is   interesting because it helps my   relationship with jessica because like   um you know when i'm not feeling great   about myself when i'm frustrated or   anxious   uh i can still love her because i can   choose to love her even if i'm like   angry   at the world or angry at myself but then   also when it comes to outside like   people friendships i can choose to love   uh and i know that it just maybe doesn't   always come naturally but i can always   say i'm going to choose to love today   i'm going to choose to love this person   so that's the best advice so good   that's great advice and i think that's   the advice that is the key to actually   sticking with a relationship   is that commitment and not just basing   it off of how you feel   or what if everything's going right but   if it's that you committed and so that's   huge   i love that jess what about you i   actually   talked to my dad about this because he i   feel like this is kind of backwards but   my dad like kind of guided my   dating life for a long time um because   as soon as i turned 16 he was like i   want you to go on as many dates as   possible   and that's always been his advice to   single people is like not necessarily   getting as many relationships but like   talk to as many people as you can and   like open yourself up to like   all different types of people that's so   good and honest it's   really great advice for single people   because then like   i never had a really really serious   relationship but when i met ben i just   knew because i'd   known all of these others yeah that's so   cool   so good and then for like a committed   relationship my dad's advice was always   put the other person first yeah so   even if it's something that you don't   want to do or even if it's   like you're not like what bin said if   you're not feeling great that day   always remember that that person should   be   put before yourself and not like help   create a healthy relationship that's so   good i love that we actually had my   great-grandma   on the podcast uh i guess a few weeks   ago and   she was so awesome she's a legend she's   almost 90 and   she was talking about her relationship   her husband died   years ago but they were married for 57   years and she said that her best piece   of advice for   relationships was to get excited about   what the other person loves   and it was like putting putting what   their excitement is first so she was   saying like   she's like i'm not necessarily a   basketball player but he loved   basketball so i went to all the games   and it was important that i was excited   for him   that he loved that and made that an   enjoyable situation for both of us   and i think that goes to putting   somebody else first you have to put   somebody else first to   lay down your own like wants and stuff   to say like this is so awesome that   we're here right now and like making   life just enjoyable for the both of you   but i love the single advice because i   think like i haven't heard that piece of   advice but   i dated a lot of different types of   people too and whenever i met christian   i was like oh i know you're the one but   i never knew you know when people were   like what is your type   like i never knew what my type was but   you kind of know the qualities that   you're looking for and so i think it's   good to date   different types of people and then when   you find the guy with the qualities   you're like   okay this is who i commit to that's so   awesome i love it   um then you just wrote a book and it is   so good   alone in plain sight which first of all   just the title is so gripping i think   for me especially too because i felt   that way in my life a lot like   you know even your subtitle that you're   seen but you're not known   and all these people like they say they   know you but they don't know you they   they see you   and they have a glimpse of you but they   don't know you and so i'm so thankful   you wrote this book   because i know so many people feel that   way and it's   so good it is so good so congrats on   that   for everybody listening it comes out   february 2nd but i want to dive into   some of the things that you talk about   you start off the first chapter right   off the bat with just like a slam dunk   talking about   who are you which is a question that   like i think a lot of people wrestle   with this who am i   and i love how you talk about you say   that a jock   is like something that you did but it's   not who you were um   because i think today that might even be   like a revelation for people like   oh that's what i do that's not who i am   and i know jess you like ran track   y'all both like had significant things   in your life that you were known for   even the bachelor even if you go on   instagram and it's your instagram or   whatever it is   but what was it like for you you can   both speak to this or one of you   whenever you went from like oh what i do   is not who i am what was that freedom   like in your life   i mean i i can start here i think the   the freedom's cr you said it best like   there's what it's like is freedom   um because like we always try to live up   to whatever expectation the world's   placed on   everybody like no matter what that title   is and that's the hopefully   the the hope of that chapter is like to   show that everybody's in this like   in this place where they're labeled by   something and maybe that label they have   on them is a shame or a guilt   or something that they've never been   able to process through or it's a trauma   and a pain   and so the hope is that like you can   release these things and re and   recognize who you are   as a human like what how you matter to   others like what how   how your love can impact those around   you um but like releasing   especially for me like releasing myself   from expectations   now i still have goals but they're a lot   different than expectations release   myself from those expectations free me   up to start   living and breathing again you know and   feeling   good and feeling like i matter and   feeling like i have value   mm-hmm yeah that's so good i love i   actually underlined this to like say   this but your quote when you said   when dreams are eight-year-old self   staked out become our identity and those   dreams do not come true   loser and failure become our new   identity and   i was like that's so true it's like and   that's why i love that you like   separated that expectation   and like the goals because i think   that's so true like whenever you go for   something like that   and then it doesn't me maybe   what you expected it to be then all of a   sudden the only thing you're left with   is oh i failed or oh i lost   which then creates that shame and the   insecurity and that   all that pain and so man you you want   people   straight through it and so if you're   struggling with identity   great first chapter i love that jess do   you feel like there have been times in   your life where you've   wrapped your identity around maybe a   certain thing that you were known for   oh totally i mean i in college   i like you said i ran track and so going   to i went to a big sec school and that   was like my thing i was like i'm the   track runner   like this is who i am i can't be   anything else   and then throughout college i admitted   that i was struggling with an eating   disorder and so i had to quit track   wow and there was like six months there   where i   didn't really have a place i wasn't in a   sorority and that's a big thing at scc   schools and   i really didn't know where to go or who   i wanted to be   i didn't even think i could stay at the   school because i wasn't   the track runner anymore so like what   was i going to be known for   well and that's actually when like   i say i became a christian i grew up in   a christian home but that was like my   turning point of it becoming a decision   like this is who i want to be so   that that was like my journey of   identity and it was really tough   and so even that chapter that ben wrote   when i read it i was like wow like this   makes me feel less alone yeah and it's   so cool   because i have these conversations with   ben all the time but wow   that's so cool   y'all i'm so excited to tell you about   this product i just found out about   called function of beauty first of all   look at how   cute this is so this is like a great   invention because you don't ever have to   be disappointed by   what you find on the shelf at any kind   of store from shampoo conditioner   because if you're like me   like when you go to pick out shampoo   conditioner it's like going to subway   you like have no idea what to get there   are way too many options   but function of beauty you actually get   to pick exactly what you want they have   a hair   quiz online that you can take you can   pick out and tell them like   i have dry hair or oily hair or straight   hair or curly or whatever   and they tailor make this shampoo and   conditioner just for you   you also get to pick your color you get   to pick your scent   so me i chose the yellow color because   that was so cute   and it's like a vanilla you sent and   look how fun the little bottle says it   says function of sadie rob so it's super   personable and so so fun   but if you want to get this which i   highly recommend they have 50 over 50   000 5 star reviews so you really can't   go wrong if you go to functional   beauty.com   whoa you get 20 off and that's actually   not just including the shampoo   conditioner but   any product they have on their store   which is so legit   but make sure you go to functional   view.com and use the slash   whoa so that you make sure that they   know that you came from our show   to get some great hair products i hope   you love your shampoo and conditioner or   whatever products you get   and make it the function of you   okay because this that's i didn't know   that story and that's   just so cool and i'm sorry that you went   through that but do you feel like a   hindsight   20 20 admitting that you were going   through that are you even though it was   so hard to admit that and you   no longer did track and it was like a   life change are you glad you   admitted it when you did totally   i'm really really thankful i'm glad it   wasn't earlier and i'm glad it wasn't   later because it was like exactly   halfway through   my college like career and so i kind of   feel like i got to like see who i was   and then like see who i could be   in like the same amount of time and i   like wouldn't change any of it   like i think that the hard parts like in   your life allow you to   share them and hopefully relate to other   people   and um i wouldn't change it at all wow   that's so good   i love that i wanted to ask you that   because i figured you would say that   you're glad that you did   and i feel like a lot of people you know   are going through stuff that's really   hard and they're so afraid to admit it   because they think like oh it would ruin   my life like   i would lose my track or scholarship or   i would   lose my job or i would go through   whatever it is i have to go through but   every time you do like every time you   admit something or you get something off   your chest you confess   something like it only gets you to where   you're going and so   it's so important to take those leaps   and to take that next step and so that's   so cool   that you shared that with us um for   y'all like   y'all both obviously went through a time   where you had to figure out who you were   separated from like what you do are you   glad   that you did that before y'all met each   other oh   yes definitely i was a miserable person   when i had my head wrapped around being   the runner and it's still   i mean it's still something that i have   to like consciously make a decision like   i'm not going to be known   for this or for that and i still will   like   have those tendencies to want to be   known for specific things but   i think after like getting over it one   time you kind of can do it again   and i think it makes you a better   partner when you're not wrapped up in   your own thing   yeah but i'm really thankful that i got   over like that piece of it   before meeting then because i don't   think he would have like hey   same i might tell christian because we   we had this moment where   we know like two years before we met we   were in the airport at the same time   and one of my friends met him at the   airport and i did it because i went to a   different gate   and we're always like what if we would   have met and i'm like you know thank god   we did not meet because   who i was at that time was not a likable   person for us to work out and where he   was too and so god simon is so great and   i feel like   when you go through those hard things   and you figure out who you are and   you're still going to be growing of   course when you meet the person but   when you know who you are in christ it   makes the whole relationship so   different   yeah yeah very great yeah it's   interesting too   because i mean it's fascinating to think   about how much   growth there was like at leading up to   jessica and then how much growth there's   been since then   but like for years of my life i wasn't a   place of growth i felt like i was in a   place of just trying to like   process and figure out and i also was it   wasn't until   like my late mid to late 20s that i   started to understand that like   i one that being the victim and having   everybody feel bad for you all the time   wasn't a way to move through life   and then two as i got through after the   bachelor   the the thing was like hey any amount of   attention any amount of fame is not   fulfilling   and so like what is it that's important   to you and so that question had i had to   ask myself the question like   before i can meet jessica the question i   had to ask myself was what is this   that's important to me   like who is it that i want to be who am   i and that was   you know i want to be uh somebody that   loves others i want to be   somebody that connects with god i love   that yeah   and so that's like that's how that's   where it's put me out and so yes like i   had to process through all those things   before i could be a good partner to   jessica that's so good i love how you   said in your book that no human can fix   your brokenness   and i think that sometimes people do   wait for that in a person   and it's an impossible thing to put on   someone and so   i know ben you talk about your faith a   lot and just you do too um   and what was it like for people i   guess wondering like because y'all both   clearly had this shift in your life   where   even you said you found it in christ   what was that like finding your identity   in christ instead of trying to wait to   find it in   a person you wouldn't meet uh you know   i think the way how i'd explain it is   it's finding your identity in truth so i   was talking to my pastor   the other day and i was like you know   what like   i can say i'm a christian because i   really believe in jesus like it's a it's   a real thing to me it's not an idea it's   not a thought   it's like a you know jesus is real and   so ultimately what i'm saying is like   i'm going to follow   truth wherever that may be and jesus is   truth   he's shown up in my life i have a   relationship with jesus and so   like as i pursue my faith i'm also   pursuing truth   because i believe there's something   greater than us out there and i also   believe that something greater caused us   to love and so   that's kind of why my relationship has   gotten so real because jessica and i   said   i don't even know if she remembers it   but it was like a a year ago and i was   like you know what sometimes in my life   like i feel like i've thrown all my eggs   in the jesus basket   and i have to continue to check to make   sure that that basket still i still   believe in that basket and   and i do uh and jesus always shows up   when i cry out for it but like that's   where my faith lies is like if you take   jesus away from me   or or if you take jesus away from my   relationship like you take everything   like nothing else makes sense in my life   yeah oh that's so good i love that   like you know i love your chapter when   you talk about   like belief and doubt and all that and i   love that wrestle that you talk about i   have to check that sometimes because   i think people associate and you even   talk about this like doubt with like a   lack of faith   but actually they go hand in hand and i   love how you challenge people that like   all of those thoughts all of those   wrestles are okay in fact like   that only has improved your faith as you   wrestle   and so i think that that is just so cool   um   one of the things i love that you talk   about and this kind of goes with   everything that you are saying is   whenever you talk about your breakup   you talk about how like you would not be   where you are now without like the hard   time that you went through of that   breakup and obviously it's the same with   just like   you talked about you wouldn't be where   you are if you hadn't admitted to the   eating disorder and you stop doing track   and there are things in our life that   are really hard   but it we would not be where we are   without them and i love that you talk   about y'all's song   so please share jess you can't you can   do it because girls get all giddy about   this kind of stuff   about your song why you chose it and   like what it means to y'all   um well then showed me this song he   it's by cody johnson who's someone that   ben   actually introduced me to but it's oh i   always forget the title   then what's it called what led me to you   yeah i know the words yeah yeah   but it talks about like all of the hard   things and then the chorus is like what   led me to you and so it talks about like   all of the hearts that are broken   all of the roads you didn't take like   all of those things and it's what led me   to you   and so that's our first dance song and   it's also the song that's like in our   engagement video and everything   i think that ben's like ben's journey is   obviously more public than mine but we   wouldn't have found each other without   all of those things yeah   so that's so sweet i love it okay y'all   don't have to share if you don't want to   but i think the way y'all started dating   like how y'all   met or how y'all saw each other if you   will is like the craziest story so   will y'all share like a little bit of   that story   yeah of course huh do you want to share   your part and and   i can tie in what on my side yeah go   ahead and start this   it's so great okay well   i'll say my part but it won't make sense   till ben says his but i   woke up thanksgiving 2018   and i had a direct message on my   instagram from someone with a blue check   mark and like a million followers   and i was like what in the world like i   was working a full-time sales job in   nashville   i didn't have like that many followers i   was so confused on how someone could   have found me and so   i showed my family my mom was like he   was the bachelor like don't you remember   he was the bachelor like four years ago   you have to figure out   how he found you and so i was like okay   and so me and my little brother sat down   and like   got all these responses go into bin to   like   try and sound smooth because i'm not   smooth so   so great we dm back and forth for like a   day   and then facetimed a couple days later   and then   two weeks later i flew out to denver oh   my gosh   and now you're there that's crazy yeah   so on the back end of that   i was in nashville tennessee for a   fundraiser uh brandy cyrus was putting   on this fundraiser i also remember in   nashville's huge and   um i was staying at the hilton downtown   in nashville and   i was checking in and there was a hockey   team checking in to the front desk   and i was like i wonder what hockey team   that is so i went to my room and i was   looking at tagged pictures from that   location because i figured somebody had   to have like tagged the picture   or tagged location with the hockey guys   and when i got on the tag   location uh the pictures from   bridgestone arena   popped up and her picture was one of   those that popped up because she was   there on a date   but she posted had posted a picture with   her dad at the arena   and i was like that girl's cute so   anyways that's in february   i then kind of like screenshotted it   because i was like i don't know how to   respond to this that might be a little   creepy   um and so i just saved onto well then   thanksgiving happened   and for whatever reason i was cleaning   out my phone from old pictures and i was   like you know what i'm gonna message   that girl tonight i'm feeling   adventurous so i did that is incredible   that's where that's when then she woke   up to the text message on thanksgiving   and the rest is history we really never   stopped talking once   like she kind of responded we just like   kept talking   and we're going to keep talking for   that's right forever   i love it i think it's so great and it's   so funny because chris and i   story is is kind of similar and it's   funny because people are like   embarrassed to say that you know he dm   me but i'm like that   is so cool like that you saw her on a   tad picture and like   christian was the same way he saw me   like two years before we met at a   passion   conference and like dm me i didn't see   it until two years later   the whole thing i actually saw after we   met when i followed him and it was just   crazy and same thing when we started   talking we just never   we just never stopped and so i love   y'all story i think it's so sweet   um so i want to talk about because you   know we have a generation   of people who are obsessed with the show   the bachelor um   and bachelor nation is obviously a huge   thing and all the things   and no hate on the bachelor at all   you've been through   other people have been through it people   who have gotten married and it's been   great for them and they've had kids and   everything but   i do think you know the way that the   show is it's kind of an unrealistic   expectation of what dating is like   and so for you who's been through the   bachelor   and now you who has met jess in this   very   unique way very organic way you know   what is it regardless a bachelor or not   that truly   do you think makes a dating relationship   a good dating relationship that people   instead of being like oh the bachelor's   the way to go it's like   no actually these are the things that   you can look for   or that you can pursue that actually   make a relationship a good relationship   yeah that's a good question um   i mean i think my advice to that would   be kind of similar what you said when it   came to singleness is like   first off like date like explore what it   is that you're interested in like what   kind of makes you tick what makes you   feel   healthiest what makes you act best so   that's the one thing   is just like dating in itself is about   exploring an adventure um and figuring   out now what helps make   a dating relationship really healthy is   i think on   honest i'd sum it up to like empathy and   curiosity and so like   be able to look across the person at the   table or whatever you're doing and like   empathize with them like compromise with   them want to see them flourish   like have that deep desire like that a   lot of like what you want to see is to   see them flourish   and they they know and respect the fact   that you invest a lot into seeing them   flourish and then the second   um is curiosity like ask the right   like that you ask the questions to   continue to explore who they are   like you ask the questions to get to   know them better you ask the questions   to like   help like try to figure them out even   though i don't know if you'll ever   figure them out   but i think when those two things like   yeah come out of a place of love   like there's a lot of healthiness and   there's a lot of excitement   for the years ahead because it will   never get old and it'll never get boring   or repetitive   yes you're not flying in helicopters and   yes you know you're not traveling the   world but like   you're adventuring together in your   everyday life which is something that's   like   just to be so fun to do forever yeah i   love that that's such good advice so   so good just uh you posted on instagram   the other day and i thought it was so   sweet about how like   you see so much boldness in ben and   that's something that like you want to   get better at and because you're you   said you're like a nine on the enneagram   and that's not necessarily   the trait that you're known for it's   like boldness or whatever and i feel   that way with christian a lot it's like   there are so many things about him that   i know i am not   but that doesn't intimidate me it   actually helps me so much   and so what are some other things in   y'all's relationship that   y'all are like different in but you've   actually seen each other grow from   um i think one of the biggest things for   me is like i said like   i'm very much a peacemaker which makes   me very passive so my communication is   not great at all and way of like asking   the right questions to the point where   sometimes it like frustrates me because   i'm like he literally sees right through   me   i don't want to because it might like   stir up something or it might like cause   us to have a deeper conversation that i   would just rather avoid   right and he has made me a much better   communicator   and he also asks a lot of questions   especially like   in our faith and everything and whenever   we   listen to a sermon together or go to   church he always asks   really hard questions afterwards and i'm   like i want to process and make sure i'm   saying the right things but he's like no   just like   say the first thing that comes to your   brain and lots of times it's not   correct for me yeah and i'm right all   the time   so really like really just need to like   process better   and then be able to communicate better   and i've   i hope i've grown in it in the past two   years but i know i still have a really   long way to go   but that's been a really big thing   that's so cool i love that bim what's   your innue grow   four so i'm the weirdo   yeah i'm the weirdo i love it no my   sister's a four i think fours are   incredible all numbers are awesome   but i just wondered with that deeper   like thinking like   think a bit longer about it or or even   just get it out before it's perfect   because   that's i'm kind of the same way i'll   just talk and talk and talk and   christian's much more of a processor   and he'll say the right thing at the   right time and i'm more like i've said a   lot of things so here's   everything i'm thinking oh that's so   good i love it   then what's something that's different   about jess that you feel like you've uh   learned from oh i mean   i think i think her desire i mean like   she sees it as a negative and   oftentimes i'll see it as a positive   like her desire to to say the right   thing not coming from a place of need to   be perfect   but like coming from a place of thought   uh a place of like   wisdom a place of processing um   i think also that like her empathy i've   always said that like   uh when jessica is at her best which is   often um she is the most empathetic   person i've ever met which because like   i'm not i'm quick to like kind of like   judge or criticize or i'm a i'm a really   good critic when i'm not healthy and   when i'm like not in a good place   and so her empathy and her care and love   uh like kind of helps me re readjust my   thought process   um which i really love and respect cause   i need that i i need that bad   that's awesome i love that y'all it is   y'all are so sweet are such a sweet   couple and i'm like so excited for all   to see each other tomorrow   because you know like if you christian   are the same way if you have to do   anything together like online   like that was so sweet you're like i   need to see you   i know it's like i need to argue right   now it's so sweet okay so lastly i want   to talk to you about this because ben   you're so honest in your book about so   many things that you've gone through and   i love that you have so much scripture   and so much   uh so many things in the bible that are   so relatable like for people who   may struggle to read the bible it's so   your book is so   easy to read but it's so powerful and   impactful but i love that you talked   about the stuff that you knew people   also wanted to talk about like the   bachelor and for me   like that's always the hard thing   because i don't want to talk about the   thing that everybody wants me to talk   about   but i know i need to because it's   important that you get   you know the heart out and you talked   about   your previous relationship and how you   were engaged before   but that wasn't the person you were   supposed to marry clearly because now   y'all are together and it's so obvious   that you all too   are the one for each other and so   there's a difference in that right i   dated people that   clearly weren't the one for me some   people that i actually thought i was   married   and it didn't work out what was it for   you   about jess or in y'all's relationship   when you were like   this really is the one i'm gonna marry   um and what are things that people can   look for those qualities to know   this is somebody like back to that word   commit that i really can commit to the   rest of my life with   yeah that's good uh well first off like   big question there's a beauty   it's a big question um there's a beauty   in the question you just asked though   that i want to point out because um   there's something important that jessica   does for me   that we talk about often that has been   been   the freeing thing that we spoke of   before so like she   gives me permission to share my story   and like she doesn't run away from my   story   um she's not scared of my story she yeah   i don't think she like wants to watch   my season of the bachelor over and watch   it with her two eyes and like have to   relive it for   13 episodes um but she she has accepted   and owned   the fact that like that is a piece of me   and it's made and it has like   it's it's brought me to this place today   and it has   it's caused scars it's caused wounds   it's caused   me to like see better what i wanted in a   partner   um and so i don't feel like i have to   run away from that or hide it or   suppress it which is like   freeing for me and like a really   beautiful thing in a partnership   that she allows me to share my story   freely and openly   and honestly so good i want to start   there   uh because that is a huge reason why   uh you know you can commit to somebody   and that you want to commit to   somebody for the rest of your life   because they free you of any shame and   any pain   like not pains they free you of any   shame and any   guilt that you've carried from past   relationships it would be really easy   for me similar to you like to walk into   life and feel like i'm only defined by a   reality show that   i did for a period of my life yes it's a   part of my story but it's not hopefully   going to be the biggest in fact   i also hope that it's not the thing at   70 years old that i'm sitting on the   couch going that was the coolest thing   i've ever done in my life yeah   i hope there's some other stuff involved   and so   i want to be free to like own the fact   that that was a season of my life but   also move forward   in what the next chapter is so the final   thought to this is that like i knew i   could commit to jessica because one   uh she wants to see me thrive like she   desires to see me thrive um   she desires to see me free um   and she also i'm a better man   with her in my life because she doesn't   restrict me   now there's obviously when you get in a   relationship there's new boundaries that   are set like   there's new things that are wise and   unwise to do but when it comes to me as   a person and   like who like god is calling like what   god has called me towards   i know that if i told her i think god   has called me to this or hey i want to   go hang out my buddies tonight   she is i don't have to worry about the   fact that i am just going to get   destroyed back home she's going to just   be like you just go   like do you and i don't know it's just a   freeing that i have with her like i feel   very free and my burden is lifted with   her that's so good no i'm so glad that   you shared that and the thing is like   for people listening   i don't just ask all these questions so   y'all can just   talk to each other about it because i   know you know all these things you you   know ben thinks about you you know just   things about you   but i think that you all are such a   great example for this generation to   look up to   like it i'm so thankful for you all   because you are   a christian couple who pursues the lord   pursues each other   so respectfully and so sweetly y'all   don't try to be perfect you're very real   about struggles you've gone through   and i think that you know a lot of   people   like we talked about like the bachelor's   their idea of dating or a dating another   dating show they watch or a dating   podcast or whatever and not that those   are bad   things at times they can be good things   but for   that's not really realistic all the time   and so to hear from a real couple   who is really walking through life and   willing to share the real things and   also   like point to jesus as the thing that   makes everything work   i'm so thankful for and i want to ask   you all these questions so people can   hear how you talk to each other how   y'all   are kind each other how you pursue each   other because that is such a great   example   and i'll just say so thank you all for   like who you are and how y'all   are walking this out and just like just   to say   from every woman in the world i just had   to like   respect you for your confidence like you   have such a quiet confidence about you   because you're not flashy with your   confidence   you don't have to post certain pictures   of you   wearing certain things or doing things   are flashing where you're at you're just   confident because of who you are and you   sit in that so beautifully   and i think that that's why you can let   ben share his story and   be who he is because you're free to be   who you are and it's huge and so thanks   for just being you   and ben thanks for being such a good man   who has   um just continued to stay true to who   you are and your faith   and just openly shared with the world   things you've gone through because it's   helped so many people   so i just think the world of y'all i   respect y'all so much i've like seen you   all both at different times and never   hung out all together   so one day we need a double date we'll   have to hit up colorado   but thanks for being on the podcast and   just sharing your hearts with us   hey thank you very much thank you that's   really kind and thank you for having   me yes hopefully the next time i see you   it'll actually be in person   gosh hopefully we always say this i know   it really is actually time we've had so   many conversations   all right well i love you guys hey thank   you sadie love you all   see you guys          welcome back to the good or bad advice   i'm your host   christian and this is my lovely   assistant satan assistant   why'd you say wife my wife assistant   okay thanks i'll take it   uh we love this part of the podcast for   you guys sending good and bad advice to   our instagram and on our yellow sister   it's our favorite part of the day it's   our favorite of the week   we love it all right let's get to it   christian you only   get better by being with people who are   better than you that's so true for you   you're so much better ever since i came   into your life   that is so true looking at my life   before sadie then i'm just like you   can't even get it in the shop it's just   way up here   um but no i think i think that's true um   but i do think sometimes you know   hanging out with people that   maybe aren't as skilled with you and   something that they like that can cause   you to rise up you know that's so true   um i think there's that aspect of it too   yeah i think there's both i mean   obviously i think it's a good thing to   hang out with people who might be   years above you and whatever they're   good at more wisdom   more more grace more love more energy   better at you than working out that's   good for me with christian because he   helps me with that there are   aspects of your life that you want to   hang out with people who push you to be   better but then there are times that   you might be a little better than   somebody at something and you need to   invite them into it and hopefully   teach people and by doing that that can   even help you increase whatever you're   doing yep   makes the world a better place yeah good   stuff you make me better too babe   you make me better too baby right me too   whenever i said that   you're so sweet oh my people are gagging   i'm just kidding   all right your direction is more   important than your speed   that is advice for you yeah that's good   advice for you you need to take that   yeah   i received that actually i received that   this was a good advice when we got from   christian i took a tennis lesson   last week and the guy was telling   christian like you're driving the car   100 miles per hour and the car   is like hard for you to control because   you're going at such a fast speed   a lot of my shots were just not going   because they weren't going in but they   were hard they were fast   and he said take it he said take it back   to like   60 like miles per hour like 70s like you   can actually drive   a car like 60 and it was so good because   christian stopped trying to kill it   every time and he was actually getting   the ball   in which made him a much better player   so i think that is   great advice and it kind of echoes what   we just learned yeah that's true   but also think about it too like when we   were dating you know we had that we   always talked about   you know yes we're going the same   direction but we want to be going the   same speed and the same pace   so i think there are aspects that you   can be going the same direction but if   if you're running faster than i'm   running you're not going to want to be   dragging me along see   if it is the same direction you want you   might want to be cautious of it in that   area   true i love that it's great all right   when you're sad eat chocolate chip   pancakes   yes great you like blueberry bacon i do   healthier than me   but that's not even like healthy i just   think they taste just   healthy no that's like a blueberry   muffin a chocolate muffin i'm not eating   the blueberry because   it's more healthy for me i think it   tastes good okay that's cool i've always   thought you did it because that was   healthier and i just like talked it   better   but i will say like obviously chocolate   chip pancakes will not cure your sadness   and i don't think you should cope with   food or anything   other than god but chocolate chip   pancakes are good and why would you not   eat one when you're sad   that's true yeah boom i think we end it   there because that was great advice that   was great advice   go eat a chocolate chip pancake peace   you   y'all i'm just gonna tell you that   this podcast is gold if you are   struggling in any season of   relationships   single dating engaged married this is   for   you i couldn't stop asking ben questions   and because i couldn't stop asking big   questions we went a little longer than   we normally do   so we're going to break this up into two   parts and so   let's just call it a valentine's day   two-part special with ben stewart   y'all this book is insane i mean he   wrote this book years ago it's not even   like promoting the book this is just   like   it's so good i want all of you to read   it um but if you haven't read it yet or   even if you have there is   so much here that i know you're going to   learn from and be encouraged by so give   it a listen   what's up fam ben i was so excited that   you are on the podcast this has really   been a long time coming because   i've had a million questions to ask you   even though i feel like   you've already answered all my questions   because of this book   so i'm super honestly so thankful for   this book i've told you that so many   times   you know we gave this book away to like   2 000 people because we just   love your the words in that book but   just backstory for people who don't know   i know you've heard this a few times but   for people who don't know   you know you used to lead breakaway   ministries   in texas let's go our next-door neighbor   let's go and i used to listen to   your uh podcast i had the breakaway app   and   uh christian also did before we met so   anyways   we meet christian and i start dming all   the stuff   and christian sends me this dm and he   says sadie   you know i think i'm going to need your   number because   for some reason the link i want to send   you to the sermon i want you to watch   won't go through instagram dms which was   so sly   so i'm like weird and i'm kind of happy   about it   so i send him my my number through the   dms and the very first   thing christian sent me if you scroll   all the way up to the very top of our   text   is your message single dating engaged   married   um so this message before even   really we read the book we listened to   your sermons on it   and then you know the book also impacted   our life so much so   i know that's not the only thing you've   done you're also a pastor   at passion city dc let's go   so many fun things and you and donna are   just great people so   super excited to have you on the podcast   well thank you sadie   it's awesome to be here with you it's   been so fun to watch   you and christian do all that you're   doing   for the sake of young people in the name   of jesus so inspiring   and you know when i wrote the book   and the talks it was really just trying   to do my best to help a young generation   navigate relationships well and so   to know that we got to play a part in   y'all's success story i'm like oh that's   great that was the hope you know   it's like man if i can help bring some   clarity into a confusing world that's a   win for me   so i love it and it was so cool too   because i really knew that christian was   using that book as a guide like funny   enough   because i was reading it too and he was   reading it i was noticing like you're   doing exactly what we're reading but i   didn't mind it i was like   if you're gonna do anything like you're   reading something or watching something   i would hope it would be   this book and so you know we need that   we need a guide   i think especially nowadays we have a   lot of different guides we have like   the bachelor and all these different   shows that are   giving us this idea of relationship   that's not rooted in a   biblical principle and you gave us that   um and you're super real   like you're super relatable and i think   that's probably because you spend a lot   of time with college students   you know college students you kind of go   back to when you were that age it's not   like   you're just saying all this stuff it's   so relatable to where we're at   um and you and donna said a great   example she's awesome by the way at   passion   after passion at like two in the morning   me and her were like drinking a   milkshake having the best conversation   i love it well uh and me and your man   were doing an   interview with shelly that was really   fun too it was good   i know so excited well let's get to the   question that i ask   everybody before we get to the book um   what is the best piece of advice that   you've ever been given   man um i know big just dropped   i would say um   existence over occupation and here's   what i mean by that   right when i graduated college i had   this crisis of like what am i supposed   to do   and i got this job that i'm like am i   doing the right thing and am i what yeah   and i had a mentor tell me he's like ben   you need to figure out why you exist   before you figure out what you're gonna   do   and then he dropped on me he's like ben   i exist   to walk with god and he was grabbing   that from colossians all things exist by   him and for him   he said so ben i exist for god and my   work   is an overflow of that relationship and   then he was like so catch this man he   was like ben i   so i work at this particular ministry   or job and if they like what i do   they'll keep me if they don't i'll   work somewhere else but i never lose my   reason for existing   it's not tied to my occupation and that   was   really freeing for me to go   i'm a man of god and the more i know him   the better i know me and the better i do   the things i should be doing so   existence over occupation yeah i feel   like do you feel like that's helped you   with like even moving to   dc from texas and all the different   things you've done just knowing that   like   it's not just about where you're at or   what you're doing but about like who you   are   yes absolutely it's awesome yeah that's   so cool   and it's been fun to watch over time you   know community helps you figure   that out it's kind of a process of   elimination like i did a lot of things i   was bad at   but then i look and i go hey when i do   this it helps people so i should do more   of this   that's good i love that and dc's all   young people   it really is it's all 20s and 30s and so   when don and i showed up here we were   like we were built for this   that's cool it's exciting yeah that's   awesome i'm so excited that you all have   passion city in dc and that you're   leading i think that's awesome   well let's jump into the relationship uh   portion   the single dating engaged mary because i   know everybody's super excited to talk   about that   um okay i want to start right off the   bat because   in your book you talk about some signs   of toxic relationships   and i've had my fair share of toxic   relationships   and so what is um what are some of those   signs to look for for people out there   that's like   i might already be in one i'm not really   sure i might be entering in one what are   those signs that we can see   this might be leading to a toxic   relationship   oh gosh yeah there's so many i would say   maybe the big   guiding one for a lot of people   is you need to look internally saying am   i looking for   a savior or a spouse you know am i   looking for   a companion or am i looking for like a   christ figure that's going to   fill every vacancy heal every wound fix   every problem   you know if you're looking for someone   to fix what's wrong inside of you   no human being can handle the freight of   that   no relationship can handle that so if   you hear somebody say something like   well if i just had a boyfriend it'd be   fine or i just need a man if i just need   this   uh girl to do this you're like whoa be   careful that you're trying to put a god   size need into a human being and that's   where you see a lot of them go wrong   you know and the bible speaks to that   you know the woman at the well jesus   encountered you know she had dated or   married   multiple guys and was living with a guy   that wouldn't marry her and jesus   starts using that kind of metaphor of   thirst he's like   you're going to this well and thirsty   again you need to come to me   first that you get a relationship with   god right   you can get a relationship with a guy or   a girl right but if you don't have a   divine   source of love like god loves me then   you're going to look for that validation   and approval from other people and when   you look for it from other people you   become   a drain not a fountain you become a   sucker of life not a giver of life   and that leads to paranoia so who were   you talking to what were you doing or   that leads to anger you're not giving me   enough attention and at least that all   that insecurity   is a siphoning of energy from somebody   else so if someone's looking for you to   meet a god-size need in their soul   they need to get that relationship with   god right or they'll never get a   relationship with you right   wow that is so good and i can just say   from   personal experience that was like   totally a relationship i was in   i didn't realize it at the time i just   thought like oh this is how it is people   said relationships are gonna be hard   people said   you know relationships are gonna be   tough there's gonna be hard   conversations but   i feel like there's a difference in it   being hard and it just being wrong   and at the time i didn't really realize   that and so   for so long it was all that paranoia and   the questions and all this stuff and   then   eventually we broke up and years later   we were able to have a conversation   which always doesn't get to happen but   i'm glad that it did and   one of the things he said to me was you   know i didn't realize this at the time   but you were god to me and when you   left it felt like god left and that's   when i realized it   and that's why i never felt like i was   enough   or doing enough or giving enough because   i couldn't be   god to him and so what you're saying   is so real and i just want to say from a   personal experience like   that is very true and so if you are   in that position that you've been saying   i need this or if i only had this   that's a very real thing to consider   that you know you're looking for really   a savior   so that's so good i'm glad that you that   you talked about that   yo any cereal lovers out there i   not kidding i love cereal the magic did   not leave whenever i was little it is   still   alive today but i know a lot of you guys

but   literally like besides so much i'm like   wow that was   me like all this stuff like it's so good   man   well i'll tell you one of the reasons i   wrote it it was birthed out of pain   i mean you could ask any of my college   buddies   my dating relationships were an endless   source of comedy for them   it wasn't funny to me i was like why are   all these so terrible   and i figured until i get me right i   can't get a wii right   i was like let me work on ben for a bit   and uh   that is good when i was a healthier   human   then i could interact with donna in a   healthy way it wasn't perfect   but some substantial healing came in my   relationship with god for sure   that's great until again you're right i   can't get away right now i just i   need that um so you talk about obviously   all the stages of relationships which i   love   because you know a lot of people um   you know really need the message of   singleness or really need the message in   dating but you really cover it all which   i'm so glad and you don't you don't   cheat any section like every section is   filled   but you talk about the purpose of   singleness and a quote that you said is   sometimes the most loving gift god can   give us is singleness   which i just when i read that i'm like   man that's so contrary to what people   think that that singleness is a gift   and so how do you begin to see   singleness as a gift   yeah that's a great question you know   paul called at that   to the corinthians about his own life   and in that same context he starts   talking about um   how the time is short so i think for me   realizing   singleness the opportunities of   singleness are perishable goods   that helped me when i was in my 20s i   just realized singleness is going to   end and so the benefits that come from   being single will   end and namely their freedom and time   like when you get in a relationship it's   you're going to lose a lot of that   freedom   right you know when i when i got married   i was happy to be married but i watched   single friends   you know when the tsunami happened in   thailand a single buddy jumped on a   plane that night   flew over there to serve people i was   like i don't have any money i just got   married i can't just   up and travel and i realized oh   i love being married but i lost freedom   and when you're single   you just go man you have freedom and uh   it will go away and kids will change it   too it'll go away so you want to   leverage the opportunities in your stage   and i think what happens with a lot of   us is   we see the benefits of a different stage   and the limitations of our own   and we're always unhappy but if you can   discipline yourself to go my stage has   particular benefits that are perishable   then you want to maximize them i don't   want to waste a second of this   and i think when we think singleness   goes on forever we'll waste time on our   phones and go no wait i can travel the   world   now i can go make a difference in my   city now and uh   there's a lot of gifts god's given us in   singleness and i just don't want people   to miss it and   you know one of the ones i hit there   really big is just the   paul says it it's it's for devotion to   the lord   like if i got to get that relationship   right first   a lot of this freedom is so i can get   that relationship with god right first   and i want to get really good at walking   alongside him   and uh when i figured that out   singleness was a lot happier for me wow   that's awesome i love that christian   talks a lot about his singleness   and it's so powerful to hear him say   because like   a lot of the biggest moments of his   testimony like the encounters with jesus   the times where he was like   okay i'm going to stop watching   pornography i'm going to stop and get   serious about the way that i you know   think about the lord and read his word   and just immerse myself in   and who he is like all that happened in   his singleness   and like prepared him two years before   we ever met and so   i've always just thought that was such a   beautiful picture and such a good   example   of how to use singleness and he'll tell   you i did not do everything perfect   and of course he didn't but he did take   that singleness seriously and that's   when his relationship with the lord got   serious and so   i love that such a good point um i love   this quote you said   finding someone is easy but finding the   right someone the right way   is not and that's true people are   struggling out there like how do i find   how do i find this guy and so or this   girl so what are things that we can look   for   and what are things that we should kind   of be on the lookout for   if you will when it comes to finding the   right person the right way   yeah that's a great question and a huge   one   you know one of the things i present   first is that whole   get a relationship with god right i   picture it like running like you want to   pursue   who god is with all of your might and as   you do that you're chasing after him   uh there's gonna be people that are   running past you   chasing other things i'm chasing fame   i'm chasing money i'm chasing success in   this business venture and you go hey   that person was cute and funny but   they're running a different direction   if i'm running after how god built me   you're going to look and see some other   people running alongside you so that's   the first sifting criteria for me is you   want the same cause   because if you marry bind yourself to   someone who's chasing something else   all that tensions on your marriage bond   and i i   i mean when i got into church ministries   sadie i talked to so many   a lot of women who were divorced that   they married a guy because he was   cute and funny and when they got married   his values were totally different so his   decisions were totally different   and it put all the strain on their   marriage bond so you needed to go   are they chasing after the things of god   if they're not let them run right on by   and then you look for a godly character   and are they being shaped by god's   character because   um you want a christian that when they   showed up for you you go   hey he was pursuing honorable sexuality   before he met me he wasn't just doing it   for me he wasn't just doing it because i   was cute   he was trying to get married to me uh   because what happens if something goes   wrong and i don't get cute i have a   medical   issue that suddenly messes me up will he   still be there for me   you want to know someone that's got   their sexuality under control   outside of their commitment to you so   you want to look for that   character and then the last piece is   chemistry do i like hanging out with   them   and that's not nothing because most of   marriage is hanging out   and obviously there's a million things   we need to say underneath all this but   those are like the big pictures are we   chasing the same cause do they have a   god-shaped character   and then chemistry do i like hanging out   with them do i look forward to talking   to them   or are they a drain and i talk to so   many people that stay in relationships   because they think they're supposed to   and they sort of don't look forward to   talking to the person on the phone   you're like you don't have to do this to   each other like you can go   that is so good i love that point   because i think people like   put chemistry aside because they don't   think that's like that's as important   and they're like   well at least he's a good person or at   least they're nice or at least they love   the lord and it's like   yes but also do you all even like each   other like do you have fun do you have a   good conversation because   you're right when you get married   especially if the world happens to go   into a pandemic and you're quarantined   together   then you're gonna really hope that you   have chemistry um   yeah i i dated a girl my my only dating   relationship i feel like i kind of got   right in college she had was chasing the   lord   had amazing character but we would just   run out of things to talk about   and we ended up having a great   conversation we were just like i don't   we don't think we're a fit and we both   cried over it we're like that's kind of   sad because you were cool   your parents would have made good   in-laws but   we just don't love hanging out and uh   donna   made me laugh and that's not nothing   yeah that is not nothing that's so   honest that's so   good i'm so glad you said that   guys i want to tell you all about   skillshare i've mentioned this

someone with integrity   and you talked about the the purity and   sexuality with that   and you got very real and last night as   i was rereading it i was like   man this is like when i first read this   when we were   dating or even whenever we were not even   kind of there even yet we were   more so just figuring out if we were   going to be in a relationship   and reading this book this this part   didn't mean anything to me but now   it really does and you talked about how   like whenever you have a baby   and then there's a time and let's just   get real you said you're not gonna be   able to have sex they're like   and it's in that moment that you really   hope you have a man with integrity   and i was like dang like i when i read   that i probably just skipped through it   because i'm like awkward haha   but then like that's real like that's   life and so   what is the importance of making sure   that who you're with   is a person of integrity yeah well   you're experiencing it right now   sadie with just the lack of anxiety for   you   of you're not going to worry about where   is christian spending his nights if he's   in the other room on a computer what's   happening or if he goes on a trip   without me   um his character gives you a sense of   safety   you know that you know i'm going to be   fine because that man is strong   for me and we need that you know the   book of proverbs   is so good for evaluation you know the   bible doesn't talk about   dating because that wasn't the method to   find a spouse but   it talks about evaluating people all the   time if you read the book of proverbs   it says when the when the righteous is a   king the people rejoice   why are people happy because they know   that person is going to do right by us   they're going to do the right thing and   so when you're married to someone that   you go   they're not gonna be perfect but they're   always looking to do the right thing   then you don't have to worry about are   they gonna stab me in the back are they   gonna empty the bank account or they go   like you go no they're trying to be   right before god and that benefits me   they want to be righteous in the way   they handle money so they're not going   to   put me in a dangerous place financially   they want to be right in the way they   talk to people so i don't have to worry   about them being violent towards me   like their their allegiance to god if   they take that seriously   leads to a whole host of virtues when   they deal with you they will be kind   they will be gentle they will be   strong and you want all those virtues in   your life you're blessed   that's proverbs 31 when a guy finds a   girl like that it's like he will rise up   every morning and call her blessed   like her commitment to god makes her   good to me even when i'm at my worst and   you want a person like that   in your home that's so true it's so good   and i i think you know   do you know like anything about the   enneagram are you an enneagram person oh   my gosh   donna is so into the indie agreement and   i have not taken it and it makes her   crazy but go ahead   because everyone loves it yeah go for it   okay well i have to just say because   as a six on the enneagram it's like the   loyalist and the biggest thing that they   struggle with is like trust and they   value security   and i always thought like you know in   relationships have been in like trust   was just gonna be a hard thing for me   because   because trust is hard for anyone right   and it's especially hard you know with   this personality type and all this stuff   and it was really hard in other   relationships to trust but i will say   it is not hard to trust christian it's   not like it's not like something i have   to   muster up and try to like really hard   just trust   him like don't get jealous don't ask him   what he's doing on his phone don't let   no i just don't have to do that because   i know   who christian is and he has so much   integrity and i know like you said he's   not perfect   but he's always looking to do the right   thing and his relationship with god   is more important than his relationship   with me and so ultimately he's   you know obeying god not just you know   trying to not do something wrong for me   and so i will just say to people who are   out there who are like   it's so hard to trust like if you're   dating somebody like   ask yourself why is it hard to trust   like is it hard because   maybe it's your own insecurity maybe   it's hurt from the past maybe it's   jealousy stuff like that   or maybe it's because they haven't shown   you the   integrity that you really need in a   person   so i just loved that point i thought   that was awesome   yeah um it's not it's not based on your   activity i'm sorry to interrupt you but   yeah it's not basically   whether you're performing so you don't   have that anxiety of oh does he   if he doesn't think i'm doing this right   or that he might go do   x or y you go no he's going to handle me   right even when i'm not at my best   that's a good feeling that is the best   feeling   so good i love that um so i already kind   of went to the awkward zone but i'll   stay there for a second because   you can't talk about relationships and   not talk about sex and the thing is too   it's like   you we would be naive as a church to not   because of how much   culture is talking about it and i love   your comparison to   sex like a fire um i thought that was   such a good analogy   um can you kind of touch on that a   little bit and explain that to people   because   there's a lot of people listening to my   podcast who grew up in church a lot of   people who   don't you know so they might not   understand why is this a problem that   kind of thing   um and so i'd love for you to touch on   that yeah   absolutely um yeah i compare sex to a   fire in the sense that   you know i heard a guy ask once do you   start fires in your living room   and that question's so crazy of course i   don't he was like so you don't own a   fireplace   you're like oh okay we naturally think   fire is good fire's good in a home it'll   bring warmth and life if   it's boxed in by strong boundaries   brick and steel then it'll bring warmth   and life   but you get a fire outside of protective   boundaries   it will burn down everything you love   and sex is the same way   and as a society in america we still   have some holdovers of christian   sexual boundaries namely it should not   cross from adult to child   the broader culture has said that yes   sex should have boundaries you go okay   but we loosened a lot of those   boundaries it used to be   socially just acceptable to have sex   within marriage now it's socially   acceptable to take it outside   but if you watch the broader culture   have we benefited from that   i would say no in every statistic you   look at for people   our loose sexuality has hurt us   it's taken something good and taken it   outside protective boundaries   and outside of that protection we've   hurt ourselves   and so what sounded like freedom   sexuality without constraint   has actually become deeply painful for   us   and you see it in in men you know   because primarily they're the consumers   of pornography women do too   statistically one in three women it's   much higher for men   um nine out of ten and uh it looks like   freedom but then it becomes addiction   and not only addiction all the stats we   see now is then it makes   not just getting married more difficult   although it's done that it's made   interaction with women more difficult   even at an interpersonal level   so you go what looked like freedom this   discovery of sexuality on a screen   has stolen from me the value of a   relationship   and the value of getting to know people   and for women it's interesting donna   freitas did this big study of   college campuses of the hookup culture   of casual sex   and she said the highest praise it got   was the word fine   no one said it was awesome no one said   it was great she said the best they gave   it was was fine   wow 40 plus percent said they felt   abused   and they felt hurt and these were not   christian people   but they were saying like this belief   i should divorce sexuality from my   emotions and take them to the culture   and just sort of enjoy it as a physical   expression   it's not true our sexuality is tied to   us   now we know chemically dopamine it makes   us happy   oxytocin it promotes bonding it's meant   to create the joyful bonding   within the emotions of another person so   when you try to divide the physical act   from the emotional bonding of a   relationship you're doing   violence to your soul and the statistics   are in we've hurt   us we've hurt men we've hurt women we've   heard children   so out of love for people i tell them   let's put this good   fire back in healthy boundaries you know   good it's good for you yeah that's so   good i love that what you said what   looked like freedom has   actually hurt us that's so real and   that's so good and   also that you you do say all this stuff   out of love and it sounds like love   because it's like i don't want you to   get hurt   and i think that that's heard from   people who have read your book and who   listen to you   that's why i'm so thankful that you're   willing to talk about it because not   everybody i would   get on a podcast and ask that too but   i've seen   how you how you touch on that and it's   it's so loving and it's so   biblical and it's also so like this is   not just for christians this is just   like the world the statistics it is what   it is   and so thank you for touching on that          hello hi hi is this aj   yes hey this is sadie and christian   christian hello   hi so we hear you have a question for us   yes my question was how do you stay   positive through   you know all the negative stuff in the   world great question   first of all you have such a great voice   you're so cute   um how do i stay positive and such a   negative   world honestly you know what i realized   in my life is the times that i'm most   positive is when i'm actually just like   weeded out the negative things that i'm   putting into my mind so   for instance you know used to watch tv   shows that   i literally couldn't even sit through   now and i would listen to music that was   just   negative for so many different reasons   and just kind of   didn't care as much about what went into   my mind   and my soul and my spirit and now i take   that really seriously so   now i've you know fill my mind with the   word of god   and feel my you know time listening to   things with podcasts or   friends who are uplifting um and it's   not being you know   an optimist it's just filling your mind   with truth the bible   says to think about the things that are   true honorable   noble praiseworthy that's the things you   need to think on   and so when i shifted to that i think   that's whenever it became a lot easier   to be   positive what about you christian yeah   that's so good well   i definitely agree with everything you   said you know for me i can look at my   life and   when there are times in my life where i   have um   let more of those worldly things kind of   into my mind i can be   um whether it's more negative or whether   it's more   anxious worrying that kind of can take   from me being positive but   the thing for me is if i don't read my   bible daily   and if i don't fill my mind with that   and try to fill my spirit with that then   i know that i'll be   um less positive toot i'll be a toot   yeah   from the standpoint of like i'll be i'll   be less um   less uh like i'll be less patient with   you i'll be more on edge and i'll be   less positive and   and those things can take can take from   that so for me the biggest thing to help   me be more positive is   not look at the news read my bible and   that sounds super simple   but that's been the biggest help for me   is just read the bible   listen to worship and then hopefully out   of that will come an overflow of   yeah positive that's great positiveness   positivity aj thanks so much for calling   and asking that question that's so good   and you sound like a really positive   person but i hope that those little   things helped   yes thank you guys so much yes have a   great day   bye bye bye   good job i love how you are like this 24   7 like   and then we actually start rolling and   you're talking back here   i was i was thinking back here that i   was slowly moving towards when i hadn't   thought   we want to keep doing this so if you   just send in your questions to the whoa   that skill podcast instagram page we're   gonna go look through them and we would   love to give you advice so we'll pick   whoever that is dmu and next you know we   would love to hop on a call   uh and feature you on the podcast so i'm   so excited to get this thing going and   that was such a great start   to this whole question thing and i can't   wait to see   all the questions people ask us we're   gonna do a mix too it's not just gonna   be serious some are gonna be fun   it can be about our life it can be about   the baby it can be about god or whatever   you wanna know we would love to   hopefully give you some good advice          you   i love what you talk about   when you kind of touch on that   difference between consumer versus   companion mentality and dating   um so what does that look like yeah   that's another big one too   yeah i'm asking you all that i told you   i have all these questions   i want everybody to know yeah well so   consumer mentality i i think there's um   tendency and i saw it in college too   people would start listening well i want   him to be tall but not too tall i want   him to be   fit but not obsessed with his body i   want him to be funny   and we start to like create this list of   characteristics   like you'd curate a playlist but what   you created is not a real human because   no one   yeah no one adds to this their problems   and i want them to be a little   disorganized and i want them to have   some issues with anger   like you don't add those so you create a   fake   person and hold a real person up to an   impossible standard   and no one likes that you know so you   talk to women and   um they don't like the impossible   standard of   magazine covers because you go they   these are photoshopped that don't hold   me to an impossible standard   men don't like it either women watch   romantic movies and say why can't you be   more like and you're like   that guy's not even like that in real   life you know so that's true   it sets you up for disappointment and   failure   and then what's crazy about it too is we   don't know what we want   that was one of the most fascinating   things stated studying it you know   match.com the online dating   they realized they tried to create that   algorithm of pick the characteristics   you want literally click them   and we'll match you with the perfect   person and their matches never worked   and so they studied their algorithm and   they realized the algorithm is not   broken   we're broken namely what people say they   want   and who they marry they said there is no   correlation between the two   so and in college my friends were like   every single one of my buddies had a   checklist my girl's gonna look like this   and this and this   and the girl they married looked nothing   like that   nothing so i'm like you have no idea   what you want   so let's all have some humility of going   i don't know   character matters but what chemistry   will i link up with   most people i know that have a checklist   is usually an idealized version of   themself   that's so good and you're like you don't   want to marry you you want to be you   you want to marry someone who   compliments you and it might surprise   you   i love that you know what's funny is   like in a weird way that's kind of like   whenever you pick out a wedding dress   is i just sounds funny but it's so   true for like all my friends that i know   like everybody had this like certain   look that they wanted to get and it was   like this this this is this it was based   off of what they had seen   that they like and then everyone goes   and you try on the dress that you always   thought this is gonna be the one it has   everything it checks all the boxes and   you're like this looks horrible i mean   this is not a fit   at all and then you go through a process   of trying different things until the one   actually fits you   and normally it's everything you said   you would never want   but it but it fits you and so that is   like so true for dating   and wedding dress shopping that you go   in you think you have this idea based on   what you've seen somebody else do   but it has to actually fit who you are   yeah so i love that so much well that's   a good word   fit do we fit is there a compatibility   that's a good way to say that   yeah that's awesome um you talk about   being unequally yoked and i love it i   love this quote you can put a bow on a   turd but he's still   a turd period and   i love i just love that concept that you   talk about   so touch on that a little bit about the   importance of uh   you know not just finding a turd with a   bow on it   exactly yeah you know song of songs   or song of solomon in the bible you know   it's it's the book of love   it opens with the woman saying let him   kiss me with the kisses of his mouth   she's so excited she's like i want to   kiss this guy's face   you know but you see four people talk   her the man god and her friends   and it's good because her friends are   not infatuated with this guy and when   you're infatuated you can lose all sense   of healthy evaluation   her friends say rightly do the maidens   love you   like her friends weren't infatuated with   them but they were watching is this the   right guy for her to feel this way about   and they're evaluating his character and   that's what the book says later your   name   is like oil poured out you have   character   that's trustworthy and infatuation can   mess up your evaluation   so you need some people to watch them   and say hey   how does this person treat people   they're not trying to get in bed with   how do they treat kids how do they treat   old people   how do they handle people they're not   trying to impress   and you want to watch their life do they   have character and so   you know i i've i remember in college   girls just wanting to get married and   they were like   oh he i met him at church so he must be   fine and you're like i don't care if   he's a church   he could be a monster i know monsters at   church   he owns a bible who cares that doesn't   matter at all   you know and so yeah you can put a bow   tie on a turd but it's still   turd man like you got to watch his   choices you got to watch his decisions   like   how does he act when things don't go his   way how does he act when someone doesn't   give him what he wants   so watch his character you want the   safety of a godly character   yes amen preach that is so good uh   well i know i know i'm asking you so   many questions but like i said like   this is just too good it's so good and   one of the things that you talk about is   clarity whenever you are dating someone   that it's such a value to   bring clarity into its situation and   that was one thing i'm sure christian   might have got from the book but   i was very impressed by and i'm honestly   shocked about how much clarity i always   had and   i never had to guess like whenever you   talk again because he was like hey   tomorrow night i'm going to call you and   then he did and like   that clarity was so valuable to me   and i remember one night i was on the   phone with him it was early on and i   said   oh yeah oh okay i talked to you tomorrow   and i said or i don't know   maybe i like awkwardly backed out like   we don't have to talk   and he was like what do you mean of   course i'll talk to you tomorrow   like it was just so funny because out of   my insecurity was like   haha whoops shouldn't have said that   that was like very good   and christian's like no of course we'll   talk tomorrow and he just brought so   much clarity to my heart i wasn't i   didn't have to get   awkward about it or confused about it i   wonder if we were going to talk again or   he was going to ghost me like   he was so good with bringing me clarity   and i think that is something that um   guys   kind of sometimes like to give and girls   too   and also i think it's something that we   don't really hold people to anymore as   much as we should   yeah well i love hearing that about   christian i knew i liked that guy   but um yeah i think uh ambiguity   leads to anxiety and so many of the   people   you talk to now if you just bring up the   subject of dating   one of the key words is anxiety and it's   because we don't know the rules anymore   and as flawed as they were in the past   cultures have had dating scripts oh this   is how this works   you know like i remember talking with a   group in india and they're like well   when you come a certain age your parents   help you find   a mate like they sort of knew this is   the steps that happen   or early in america a guy would come a   call in to a girl and sit in the parlor   with her and her family and   like it wasn't perfect but you at least   knew what was coming   and in the in the world today we don't   have a dating script and so   everyone doesn't know the rules and i   like to tell young people that's not   your fault you didn't create that   it is your problem society has not given   you   clarity on here's what to do so you're   like do i text do i call do i dm them do   i like nobody knows   and but what we do know is the bible   says an   honest answer is a kiss on the lips a   way to be kind to someone and care about   them   is to give them honesty or in the new   testament it says we speak the truth in   love   we graciously speak the truth to each   other and we know that clarity is   kindness   it was a kind thing for christian to say   to you i'm interested in you   i'd like to spend some time with you now   you know and i did   i did a bunch of checking in on this   with girls too just to ask them am i on   the right track here and all of them   were like it's the ambiguity that kills   us   and i even asked him questions like so   should he ask you on a date is that word   old-fashioned   and almost 100 said no   use the word date because at least i   know what it is but when you say   hang out i don't know what hangout means   and then you're telling your friends uh   i think it might be a date i don't know   we're just hanging out i don't know   other people yeah yeah am i gonna get   dressed up sit on the couch and   play fortnite like what wait what is   this exactly   but you know it's funny because um you   know in the past   um i remember in texas going to a small   town in texas   and they had a dance every friday night   and it was expected a young man would   ask a girl in town to go to the dance on   friday and everyone knew   this isn't marriage it's every single   week though this dude's taking a shot   every single week he has to take a shot   and he just got better at it because the   reps   but young men now don't get near the   reps   and so they're awkward they don't know   what to say it's confusing so i feel a   compassion for young men like   that's why in the book i try to help him   and it's funny because i'll have a lot   of girls come to me now and say like he   said the exact words in   chapter and i'm like that's fine that's   a win that's what i'm saying i took it i   was like   i'm so glad you said the exact words   clarity's kindness we got to help each   other guys and girls guys need it too   that guys are just as insecure as girls   and if you can tell him on the front end   i'm not interested i am   that feels scary but honesty is better   than ghosting and so   uh it's better to be real for sure i   love that that's so good          yo i want to tell you about this new   thing i heard about called the birdie

  marriage and i think that goes yes that   is kind of on the same track as clarity   but even more than that like confession   of   things that you've been through your   past where you're at now and all those   different things   um i've had other people come to me and   ask me this question like sadie   like i know you and christian talk about   being real with each other and sharing   your story   but when is the right time to do that um   and so   when do you think the right time is to   share you know some of those really real   things that   maybe you've walked through or are   currently walking through   in a relationship yeah that's a great   question   well you know dating is more about   guiding principles than steps so it's   hard to say well on date six do it   you know it's guiding principles but you   can say   date one not the time to unpack all the   broken seer past   i would say after you're engaged   you should do it before that you know   because i've we've counseled couples   donna and i where it's   the wedding date set and announced and   then some really deep   sin issues come up that confuse the   couple and they got to process them and   you go don't put the pressure of a   wedding date on top of your still   processing together so i'd say in that   dating world   you're getting to know each other enough   to say do i trust this person because   what you're talking about   sadie is what everybody wants when   they're married   is i want someone to know all of me the   best and the worst   and love me that's what we want we want   the security of knowing that   when i wake up that person loves me and   they're not leaving me they're gonna   stay   but to have that security you have to   give them honesty and that's scary   so you have to build enough trust and i   love the way the book of song of solomon   presents it   it presents the heart of this woman like   a dove   and the up in the cleft of a rock it's a   fragile bird   high up and the guy doesn't   run up and grab the bird and he it's not   in chapter one but   as they get to know each other over time   and start to realize this relationship's   serious   i could see us getting married it seems   more   possible that this is the person maybe   more likely than not   then i do think you get to a point where   like the dove leaving the cleft of the   rock into the man's hands   i do think there comes a point where you   say let me tell you the good the bad and   the ugly about my past   and you will probably both cry   um there are some hard things that we   have all done   and hard things that have been done to   us   but if we can hear all that and like   christ see the worst of each other   and say i forgive you i love you i want   you   that can be so healing for people   i strongly encourage that to happen but   you don't want to rush into it because   you can needlessly confuse and hurt each   other so   it's a tricky balance and that's where i   think wise counsel can help you   get some people around that love god and   love you that say hey maybe now you're   at the point to   to share with him a little more of your   story it's good oh it's so good i am so   glad that you touched on that because   that was one of the most pivotal moments   of krishna's relationship in the best   way   it was so hard and we did both cry   and it wasn't just a one-day   conversation   but the forgiveness and the love and   just the beauty of that moment   getting to show each other um a human   version of what christ would do in a   non-perfect way   but still love each other was a   beautiful thing that i think   really made our relationship what it is   today   and that's why we can trust and love and   feel   loved because we know that we're known   and so i just love that   um i love how you talk about   man's initiation and christian talks   about this a lot this is something in   the book that i know really touched him   but you say   you don't just fall out of love you fall   out of trying   and i thought that was really really   good and so you know i think when we   start dating we   we really try hard right we're bringing   out all the stops and then there's a   point where   even the other day actually um it was it   was funny i was getting my nails done   and i said something that christian i   was like oh yeah like and then   he went he's going to get me this real   fast and he'll be here and he was like   oh yeah you can tell that y'all just got   married you don't do that whenever   you're 10 years in like us   and i was just like that's sad because   that was just such a little thing   you know but people do stop trying and   so what's the importance   of keeping that um keeping that going   that pursuit yeah you know what's crazy   because   donna and i say this to each other all   the time and we laugh because we're like   i bet a lot of people would not believe   us   because it sounds so corny but we're   like we love each other   more now than ever to the degree that   our first year of marriage love was   sincere but so   shallow and uh we know each other so   much more now and   trust each other so much more now and   i can encourage her   so much more deeply and more quickly   and we can resolve conflict in such a   better way and   and all of that is because we've clocked   the hours   talking we've just spent time together   and   you know we we watch some tv not a lot   it's more common for us to sit on the   back porch and talk   i know when i'm at work when i go home   about an hour a night don and i are just   going to sit there and talk about our   day   and it seems so simple but when you look   and i'm like   i trust her down to the   smallest bit of dna in me the deepest   parts of my bones i trust donna fully   and uh i have that and then we'll   counsel couples that don't   and you go what's different and what you   see is it started early in their   marriage they just   quit cultivating that that communication   of pursuing each other talking through   things   and so when you don't cultivate a seed   you don't enjoy the fruit   you want to enjoy fruit cultivate the   ground and   we've cultivated a lifetime of   communication and   now two decades in gosh   um it's the best it's ever been   it's amazing i highly i highly recommend   it   that's so encouraging see that is so   encouraging because you hear these other   couples say stuff like that and you're   like dang i'm kind of scared of ten   years   right now and instead of hearing that   yeah yes   that is so good i love it last question   i want to talk to you about is just the   quote that you say your marriage will be   most fulfilling on mission   and it's so funny because louis uh makes   fun of like he doesn't make fun of me   and christian but he kind of laughs at   us he says   you are the only couple i've ever met   that have a mission statement for your   relationship   because we read the book and we we   really took that seriously   and then our uh premarital counselor   told us that we should have a mission   statement and we were like oh my gosh   this is like our mission you know   and so we do and it's like stuck with   this and   apparently on our wedding day we looked   at each other and we said like we are   the huffs and we are and said our   mission statement and so   louis louis loves to quote our mission   statement to us   but i think it is so important and   you're so right when you have a   mission-minded marriage like there is so   much   passion and uh love and oneness and just   you're going for it   for the same thing and i just love it so   can you touch on that   as we close about just having a marriage   with a mission   yeah well no one unifies around unity   in the world about anything you don't   unify around unity we all unify around   something   you know yeah and if you look at the   strongest teams   like a sports team they were like we're   gonna win the super bowl we're gonna win   a mission creates that unity you know   a cause can strengthen community   and it's because god built us that way   you know he said you exist   for me that's why paul told young   timothy   hey flee youthful lust pursue   righteousness along with those who call   out to god of a pure heart he was   telling his young protege that because   he's like that's life timothy   get away from stuff that's picking you   apart and ruining you   run after the beautiful life god made   along with a community because that's   the way life's meant to be lived a   community on a cause   belonging and mattering they're the   deepest longings of our heart and then   when you put that in a marriage   hey i'm not trying to look into your   eyes to find meaning   i'm gripping your hand and we're chasing   meaning together   boy that's really fun and i think that's   part of why donna and i's marriage is so   happy is   coming here to dc was not like well ben   got transferred because of work and   donna's got to come along   it's not like that it's like hey god   called us to each other   god has called us to make a difference   for his name is this where god's calling   us and we made that decision together   and being on mission together is so   energizing   i strained to find the words to explain   it but i really wish people had it and   the folks you're talking about that are   bored   i talk to too many people that are like   in their 30s 40s i'm like you're too   young   to act this old i knew 60 year olds   who are fired up because they're on   mission together i mean louie and shelly   would be a cause of that   you're be a good example of that so you   don't want to miss that yeah you   grip hands and run into god's future   together and i promise you   life will be fun that's awesome come on   well i know so many people are so   encouraging   whenever i do podcasts with people like   you i literally can't stop smiling   because i'm like i'm so excited for   everybody to hear this   because honestly it's the questions   people ask me that i'm like   uh i wish i had the words to say   it better and more wisdom to say it but   i do know somebody   hold on and wait for this podcast   because that that is   the heart of this podcast that i would   ask these people who have influenced me   these questions and help break it down   for all of these   college students and and you know our   listeners are all ages but primarily the   18 to 25 year old   who just needs some guidance and some   help and some advice   and so thank you thank you for writing   this book   thank you for preaching on a weekly   basis and just   getting out the good news and great   advice   ben we appreciate you christian and i   are so thankful for you and donna and   y'all's   life and ministry so thanks for this   awesome conversation   hey thank you it's honored to be here we   love you guys we are   we are so thrilled with what you're   doing and just could not cheer you on   strongly enough and i hope everybody   listening   gets in y'all's wake and follows the   kind of purposeful living y'all are   doing it's inspiring ah thank you   it means so much thank you sure          hello hi hi this is sadie and christian   what's up what's your name sarah sarah   um nice to meet you sarah it's nice to   meet you too i'm from california   um sadie i actually met you on dancing   with the stars one time   no way you were like super sweet but   i just want to tell you before we get   started um   i'm 19 but seeing you walk through your   faith   it really shaped me as a person just   without you like with christian   background too i my mom passed away   years ago   but it really shaped my morals as a   woman too   so wow thank you so much sarah that's so   cool thank you so much for sharing that   with me that   truly means so much and that's so cool   that we've actually met   i love yeah i used to get mistaken for   you all the time in l.a it was so   funny um yeah   you had covet and anxiety and eating   disorder and that's literally   what i've been going through all year   wow so   seeing that you went through that in a   podcast too it just   you went through it kind of before me   too so it was nice to have that   preparation oh well i'm glad i could   have been a sister and a friend from   afar to you   yeah thank you you sent in a great   question remind us   me and christian and everybody saying   what your question was   so um when you and your significant   other   are going through a minor issue   and that trust is kind of broken but   it's not   big enough to break up over or anything   like that   it's just that person didn't follow   through on what they were going to say   and it hurt you inside   how do you build that trust on both   sides back yeah that's so good and   that's so real honestly like when i saw   your question i was like   this is great because christian and i   went through this and i love what you   said   um you know it's not like a breakup   issue but it is an issue that you have   to   deal with and take seriously and um you   know i think   when you're in a relationship and you've   already established that   you know their character they know your   character y'all are   good people but that doesn't mean you're   perfect people you couldn't be perfect   so you're gonna mess up there are gonna   be times where   you have to humble yourself and say   you're sorry or the other person's gonna   do something that you're like   why did you do that and vice versa um   but i can remember when christian and i   were about six months into our   relationship   something happened where it just kind of   broke trust a little bit and   it was upsetting and you know but it   wasn't   major it wasn't something to break up   over but it but it bothered me and it   and it kind of hurt our trust   and you know what we realize in that   moment and i will say   it wasn't easy and it didn't all just   click like   right when it happened it wasn't like   the most pleasant conversation and we   grew a lot   in that and learned how to communicate   through frustrations and hard times   but one of the things that we realized   was really the breakthrough   was just our complete honesty   with where we were at christian with   where he was at   and why a decision was made that hurt me   and me   where i was at and why insecurity was   rising and that honesty and that   vulnerability   you know brought us to a place where we   weren't defensive   and we weren't still in   jabs or anything like that we were just   able to listen   and on a human level relate to where the   other person was   at i can relate to him for maybe the   mistake that he made and he could relate   to me for the insecurity that was rising   because of that mistake   um and so for me i would say that   breakthrough really came from that   vulnerability   to just get past like what actually   happened   and get to like why it happened and   why it made me feel the way that it did   and why i don't want it to ever happen   again   um yeah and christian had some advice   from the guy's perspective   yeah that's really good um yeah so   when something like that happens um   i think the biggest thing is um   like you said just complete honesty and   transparency and just being able to   you know have a conversation about it   and um   you know owning your mistakes and i   think after that happens   the thing moving forward you have to be   consistent and i know that   for me um as someone who did that   i think that the biggest lesson that i   learned was   you know you can say sorry a hundred   times but   if there's no action that follows behind   that then those are just kind of words   so for me   when i was apologetic about it there had   to be   um uh built a build up back of trust and   that only came through being consistent   and being honest and real um and because   if if i was honest and real when that   when said that that happened   but i wasn't consistent then there would   have been that would have been   there would have been probably would   have ended ended things but if you can   build that back up through consistency   and truly see   the integrity of someone i think that   speaks volumes to that so true because   if somebody does something they're truly   sorry   and you begin to see a consistent you   know behavior that isn't like that then   you can know   okay that's not who you are that's just   a mistake that you made and   i'm gonna forgive you because odds are   this could be me next month like i   i might do something that's gonna upset   you and like i have since this time when   we were   only dating six months there have been   times i've said things that hurt   christian   and things that i've regretted you know   that i've had to say hey i'm really   sorry the reason that happened   or the reason i said that is because of   this and i understand how that made you   feel and i'm really sorry and then   now i can't just say sorry i i need to   fix the way that i speak you know   and so i think those are some things to   get past some of those hard moments but   i love that you asked this question it's   so honest it's so real   and i think it's going to help a lot of   people because relationships are hard to   navigate and learning how to communicate   is a huge part of that   so thank you so much for asking that and   thanks for telling me a bit of your   story   that was beautiful and i just feel so   grateful that god   has used me in your life in a very   significant way   yeah he definitely has um if you're ever   in l.a   come check out the church it's amazing   it's um a connection to bethel   so it's called presence cool that's   awesome well thanks girl it's great   talking to you today   thank you bye bye   sweet great question great question so   good y'all i love this i love how   whenever y'all are calling and asking   these questions we can just be real   we can be vulnerable with you all and   hopefully give you the best advice that   we have to a situation   we're not perfect but we're gonna give   you what we've learned in the best way   we can and hopefully   that not only points you to a better   place in whatever relationship you're in   or season you're in but hopefully it   points you towards jesus because   ultimately   all of our advice is stuff that we've   found in the word or through prayer   or through just honestly godly mentors   and people that we've asked and so   i hope this advice helps you and i hope   that you know that you have a sister and   a friend from afar   and a brother right here and a brother   from afar my boo   uh well we love you guys keep calling   keep asking great questions and we will   keep

everything   not only this interview but every   interview you've ever done will be   deleted   oh there they are great all right we're   back   perfect okay i never knew a computer   could run out of space   all right well welcome to the podcast   making pivot i am   so so so excited that y'all are here   honestly um you know i've done a lot of   interviews but i was like   giddy about this one i was like nervous   and giddy because i just love you all so   much   so welcome to to the whoa that's good   podcast   yeah we are so thrilled to be with you   it's absolutely wonderful to be with you   i'm so excited so for those   who don't know who y'all are y'all are   over in london   right england and i   had i got to meet y'all in a really   unique special way so i'll kind of   connect the dots for people   who don't know how we met um it was   actually really crazy because   y'alls are a part of starting the alpha   whole   alpha thing and i went to the alpha   conference but the reality is i just   signed up to go to the conference i was   just like   going to attend with my friends because   i heard that it was amazing my mom and   dad actually went the previous year   and called me and she said sadie we are   moving to london   we are joining htb we are starting this   alpha thing with like she was so excited   and i was like well   that's a big leap but i'll start by just   going uh   and seeing the alpha conference and so   in the meantime y'all reached out and   asked if i would do a q a and i was like   wow that is so   you know amazing and i just felt really   humbled that y'all would want to   interview me and really thankful well   when we get on the phone and we start   talking   as you're telling me what we're going to   be doing   i'm like wait a second i think i had a   dream   that was exactly like this and it was   just so cool because   fast like flashback to six months before   i had a dream that i would be speaking   on the same night as mike todd and event   and that it would be a global event and   that you know that song set a fire would   be   just kind of the anthem of what we would   be doing that we would be wanting to set   a fire   in the different countries that we were   speaking to it's a very prophetic dream   because fast forward six months later   and i'm talking to y'all not knowing i'm   gonna speak at alpha you're like   pippa said this night is gonna be set on   fire   because it's gonna be you and michael   todd and it's a global leadership   there's gonna be people all over the   world i'm like wait i   totally have had this dream and so   we got to meet really and such a   god-encounter way   and that just set up our relationship to   be so special i spent some time with   y'all in london and then was supposed to   a christian spend all summer   this past summer and london with y'all   but the pandemic kind of   kind of ruined those plans a little bit   but god had different plans obviously we   didn't know we would   be expecting a baby and all the   different things and so   for for those of you who didn't know   nicki and pippa that's how we met   but actually the funny thing is as i   talk to people i'll say   you know one of my favorite leaders is   nikki gumble and pippa   and people say oh who is that and as   soon as i say bible one year everybody's   like oh my goodness we love them   because so many of my friends listen to   the bible one year so   i'm excited to hear from you all as i   know many are but we'll start with the   opening question of my podcast   what is the best piece of advice that   you two have ever been given   i was very struck by somebody called   cardinal tagli   who is the cardinal in charge of the   philippines um   church all those millions of people   there he said   to us um i take myself   i don't i i don't take myself   seriously but i take jesus seriously   that's good and that has always struck   me that i've worried   so much about what people think what i'm   doing what i   don't do but he said don't take yourself   seriously   laugh at yourself make mistakes do   things wrong   but take jesus seriously   i love that that's so good i feel like   you know people always ask me for people   who watch our tv show about uncle sai   because if you've ever seen our show my   uncle is like crazy   and people have said what have you   learned from your uncle and i always say   well he doesn't take himself   so seriously but he is so serious about   his faith so   i love that that is a piece of advice   that stuck with you and i i hope to do   the same live my life the same that i   don't take myself too seriously i can   laugh at myself but at the same time   like jesus   is a very serious thing i love that   that's so great nikki what about you   so i had this pastor a very old man   he's no longer alive but um he was just   a wonderful man   and i heard him give this talk where he   said god loves you   unconditionally wholeheartedly   and continuously and after the talk   he came up to me and he said   do you believe that god approves of you   and i said well actually i struggle with   that because i know things that you know   everybody else doesn't know and i find   it difficult to believe that god really   loves me   and he said to me god wants you to know   that he approves of you well he loves   you   wholeheartedly continually   uh and totally and i found that   one of the hardest things most important   things to know in life is that you are   loved   and you're loved totally continuously   wholeheartedly   and so that was a very profound   and to know that god approves of you   yeah well that's beautiful i love that   and i i just love that you shared that   because i feel like people already   listening   struggle to believe that about   themselves you know struggle to believe   that   they're loved and that they're approved   and that they're   a part of a good creation you know and   so i think that   already people listening to this podcast   can take that word   and know that they're loved and know   that they're approved and that's   something that   shapes your whole life um so i gotta say   you two really are some of christianites   favorite people and i know we don't even   know y'all super well   but we just look up to y'all so much   from afar and we're not the only ones we   were talking to uh louis and shelly   gaglio one day   about y'all and nick uh louis said nikki   is one of my favorite leaders to look up   to   because of his humility and your   both of you your humility and what   you've done and how you've led is so   beautiful   but also not just leaders in the church   honestly y'all are like our relationship   goals like a lot of people here you know   have like celebrities that are like   their relationship goals but   nikki and peppa gumble are our   relationship goals   so tell us back up way way way way back   how did y'all first meet and how did   y'all start y'all's relationship   well that was before we were we were   christians   yes we're back at about age 17 18.   and i wanted to get into a nightclub and   you had to be a member   and someone gave me nikki's telephone   number i never met him   and i rang him up and asked him whether   he'd get me into this nightclub   that is amazing so y'all come a long way   a lot has changed okay so y'all weren't   christians but now obviously   i've hyped y'all up to be these   incredible church leaders so   when did y'all become christians how did   you meet jesus   well i i encountered jesus through   reading the new testament   i i was an atheist um i'd sort of   written essays   proving that god didn't exist and my two   closest friends told me that they had   become christians and i was so horrified   that i wanted to help them   and so i decided to read the new   testament   and as i read the new testament it was   as if   the person i was reading about in the   new testament jesus   emerged from the pages and i encountered   him   wow and that was a life-changing moment   i discovered that jesus   jesus said i came that you might have   life and life in all its fullness   and since that time that's what i   discovered wow that's so powerful   so i i heard you tell your story one   time   and how when your friend started   becoming christians you were like   so worried about them and you said they   were such wonderful people i didn't know   what happened to them   and so you had this like view of   christianity as   such like a negative thing why where did   that come from that   you had this uh negative view of   christianity and who christians are   i think i think it was um maybe just   a view of church you know i've been into   i found   my impression of church was that it was   boring i'd been to services that were   very dull   i thought it was boring i thought it was   irrelevant to my life how could someone   who lived 2 000 years ago   2 000 miles away be relevant to my life   and i thought it was untrue i didn't   think there was any intellectual basis   for christianity   and i i couldn't have been more wrong   jesus said i'm the way   the truth and the life come on that is   awesome   to all the creative people out there and   social media users you guys are going to   love this one i want

think i sort of had had a nominal   christian   up at bringing you know that we   certainly wouldn't have called ourselves   not christians but we never talked about   god we didn't have a bible in the house   we didn't pray together   so i sort of liken it slightly to saying   i i know the queen but i've never met   the queen i think that was a slightly   a bit like i thought of god god jesus i   knew of him   but i'd never met him i'd never   encountered him i didn't have a   relationship with him and i had   no concept that i could know him and yes   i met nikki   and he that then and he was very zealous   after he became a christian aft   so when i resaw him he was running   around with tracks in his   pocket trying to convert everybody and i   was like          leave me away from this man um i think   he's gone crazy   um and so totally separately i met these   other   young people who'd arrived in london who   were   christians who wanted to talk about   their their faith   and i was captivated by them because   they were genuine they were real   they loved me for who i was not anything   that i could give them   and as they talked to me they opened the   bible one day with me and read from   john verse chapter 10 verse 10 and that   jesus says   i came that you might have life and life   to all its fullness   and i thought yes that's what i want i   have a life and it's great you know it's   fine   it's great but i'm missing something i   want this fullness of life   and um i went back that day knelt   down and asked jesus into my life wow   that's incredible   so i hear you're both talking about this   life and life abundantly life and life   to the full   and you all both had an experience   living life without jesus and you've had   an   experience and the majority of your life   living life with jesus   can you tell an obvious difference of   the fullness   of life from where you were and where   you're at now like that promise that   initially sparked y'all to get into   faith has that carried through for y'all   in your life   well i think i think the difference for   me is like before   i was always looking for the next thing   i was never   really satisfied i thought i worked at   the time i wasn't going around thinking   i'm not sad no i was i was you know i   was in my first year at cambridge   university   i had loads loads of friends i was   having fun i was at parties every night   i was at this nightclub every night   i was like that was my life and i   thought it was great but there was   always i was always looking for the next   thing   right and um uh   it was like there was something missing   and it was only when i encountered jesus   that i realized there was something   missing i was like i had a spiritual   hunger   and that spiritual hunger was satisfied   jesus said i'm the bread of life   and it's like you know in the morning   i'm hungry for breakfast   but there's also a spiritual hunger   right i'm   hungry for for a relationship with god   we're created for a relationship with   god it's like   until we find that relationship there'll   always be something missing and i think   that's what i discovered that it really   is true that in that relationship   you find the purpose of your life i   think everyone's looking   for purpose everyone's looking for love   and everyone's looking to belong   and in jesus i found all those things a   purpose through a relationship with god   through jesus i found love found that i   would   i was loved um and i found a belonging   i found this community of people that   i had loads of friends but the   relationships   that i've had since with like people who   are   also sons and daughters of god followers   of jesus full of the holy spirit   it's a different kind of relationship   it's a closeness of a relationship   that's amazing   and i think for me it sort of   again i thought i had a great life in a   way   because i had sort of but it was so   looking back it was so superficial   and i think if jesus hadn't found me and   rescued me   i don't know where i'd have ended up i   think i was so   into just going along with the flow of   things i could have gone in any   direction   right and i realized that actually   that god has a plan for our lives we're   not just wandering around aimlessly   trying to have the most fun we can have   or do whatever we want just to please   ourselves but actually   that god has a plan and a purpose for my   life   has given me direction i'm not saying i   haven't wandered from the plan   or or struggled at different times but i   have known   that there is a plan and a purpose for   my life that jesus has mapped out and   has gone before me and i want to follow   that plan   that's amazing i love that it's so cool   because one of my favorite verses   is that i am the way the truth and the   life and that no one gets to the father   except through me and y'all mentioned   that several times and   i think why i've loved that so much is   because not just this generation but   just   everybody living right now we're looking   for a way we're looking for   direction we don't want to think that   we're just walking around aimlessly   doing stuff for no reason for no purpose   a lot of times this generation also is   so loose with what truth is and we're so   confused by that   and then what is life for and jesus just   simply says i am the way i   am the truth i am the life and if you   want to get to the father who   is love you come through me and so in   that it literally answers like   everything that we're looking for   everything that we're searching for and   it's so cool to hear your stories   because   you two are people that christian and i   and several others look   up to so much and i know that y'all went   through that journey   of struggle and went through the journey   of you know   turning away from god thinking this has   no relevance to me thinking   how is this man 2000 years ago any   relevance to me   to now finding the way finding the truth   finding life is so inspiring and so   encouraging   real talk ladies if you don't

for years and   were a lawyer for years   um and then also in your alpha course   you talk a lot about   evidence evidence about jesus evidence   that god is real   so what does evidence mean for you   in your life of faith you know since you   have that   law background and you crave that   evidence   yeah i mean sometimes people talk about   christianity being a blind leap of faith   i don't believe it is i think it's a   reasonable step of faith   i liken it to a jury trial   having to return a verdict they hear the   evidence but they weren't there   they have to take a step of faith to   return their verdict   and i think it's the same uh you you   can't prove   christianity is true it's not like two   plus two equals four that's like a   mathematical proof you can't prove it   scientifically   but there is good historical evidence on   which you can put your faith   and faith is much more like love you   know you can't prove love   if you say how how can you does pippa   love you   uh well i i believe she does can you   prove it   i can't prove it to you   but i think there's i think there's lots   of good evidence that she does   but i can't prove it i can't there's no   sort of mathematical scientific proof   that she does   but but i believe it and i think faith   is very much like that there's good   evidence   that jesus uh existed he lived   he died and he was raised from the dead   there's good evidence for the   resurrection   but at the end of the day that's   historical evidence it's like the kind   of   evidence that a jury would hear and then   you have to put your faith and you have   to take a step of faith   but when you take that step of faith   then you   have an experience of that relationship   so that confirms   that um uh you know there's there was   a great one of the great theologians of   the church   senator gustin said that um uh   that that we people think   that you you put your faith because   you've seen   do you need to see in order to to   believe but he said it's the opposite   you believe in order that you might see   and it's actually when you put your   faith in jesus that was my experience   the moment i put my faith in jesus i   knew it was true   that's amazing because of the experience   and i think the same is true it's it's   you have to take a step of faith and   when you take that step   then you see wow and you can't so so   um uh that's the way around people   often say you know i i um   another theologian said said it's not   it's not that i understand   in order to believe i believe in order   to understand   wow and you can never fully understand   this world until you   put your faith in jesus and when you put   your   jesus it's like your eyes are open to   understand   that this world is created by god that   there is a god   and that jesus is the son of god and   that the holy spirit comes to live   within you and he opens your eyes to see   and to understand   wow that's amazing you know it's so cool   that you shared that because this   morning i was like praying for this   conversation and just god what do you   want us to talk about   what do you want us where do you want us   to get and   i was thinking about how cool it is that   you know   because honestly before i do any   interview i study   because actually nikki you gave me this   advice you said   to be a good interviewer ask questions   you already know the answer to   and so i make sure i make sure i really   study who i'm about to   talk to and i mean i was like   on a roll yesterday i was listening to   all your alpha talks and   read i'm actually on day 40 of bible in   a year so i've really been keeping up   with you guys   and um i was thinking about just how   much y'all done and   in ministry and how much you've started   and everything but i was thinking back   to whenever you were an atheist   and how it was just so crazy to me to   think that   okay so if y'all had stayed with that   path then maybe you wouldn't have seen   god do all the things that you have but   because you took a chance to believe   you've seen god time and time and time   again to bring confidence to the   evidence that god is real for you   and so now like you couldn't say no god   isn't real because of all the evidence   that he's done even whenever   i called y'all and when y'all called me   and were interviewing me and i told you   about the dream   and y'all both got out your pins and   your paper and you're writing it down   it's evidence it's like   wow god you're showing up you're doing   something and so   that just proves that thing that you   know a lot of times   you do have to believe before you see   but when you start to believe   the awe and wonder you will walk in   seeing   the amazing glimpses of god in the the   day-to-day things the big moments the   quiet moment during a pandemic during   the years that the church is driving all   the different ways   and so that's super cool that you   brought that up um pippa i want to talk   to you about i know   i just found this out that you got lung   cancer this past year   and first off i was so crushed and i was   so sorry   that you've been going through that and   you've been dealing with sickness   and i watched the interview y'all did   about having faith over   fear in those times and i think that   that's such an important message right   now   because not everybody's dealing with the   face and the fear of cancer   but people are dealing with the fear of   this   virus people are dealing with the fear   of their parents getting it their   grandparents who have gotten it   and there's a lot of fear right now and   beyond even this year there's fears that   spark up in our everyday life and so   what have you learned this year battling   this about having faith over fear   well it was back in um uh   it was november 2009 um   and 19 that i had it so just over a year   ago   but i had all the surgery i'm so glad i   had it that year and not this year in co   yeah in cope with all the lockdowns and   i was   you know i was i was blessed that they   found it early   but anything like that hospital   appointments   scans and you know endless sort of tests   and seeing people   is scary i think it's scary for us or   all when you face those things   and i suppose you know the dangers were   frightened of death   and of course death is a very difficult   thing we don't talk about it very much   today it's   it's not something that the people talk   about in the early church   they were you know as paul said to live   is christ   to die is gain you know that actually   they had their eyes   set on heaven and the resurrection much   more than i think   we all do now and i know i i do too i   hold on to life i want to do this i want   to be here   and all the rest rather than thinking   when i get there that's going to be   the best that's going to be far more   than we can ever ask or imagine   that it's going to be so beautiful in   heaven seeing and being with everybody   so i think you know i think we battle   with our human   sort of failings and fears are a very   real thing   but i think it is you know i'm so glad   for the christian community because they   pray   yeah and when they pray it makes a   difference   and i would naturally have been very   fearful but i   you know i have to say going in for the   operation and everything that   because people prayed i actually felt   peaceful   wow i if someone had left a little   present on my doorstep who'd come   overnight and it was there in the   morning   you know it's very touched by people in   the church so that we're praying   and i actually did sleep the night   before pine   before it really and in a sort of way   went into it feeling um   that the lord was with me now um i can't   say i enjoyed the next few weeks very   much   and it was tough it was very tough it   was   it was tough it's not it's not fun but   i slept on two chairs i set up two   chairs   and i slept 11 nights on these two   chairs   um and um   i went i went home one night and i went   home one night   and i i decided after that one night i   would   much rather be uncomfortable with her   and comfortable with items oh that's so   sweet   i love that yeah i mean he was   he was amazing he stayed with me the   doctors and nurses were amazing and   thank you know i'm so thankful for   modern medicine what they can do i'm   thankful even now that they're working   on you know cures and vaccines   for for pandemics you know modern   medicine has saved my life   wow um and it saved nicki's life you   know many   you know many times over so but i think   it is a choice   about faith over fear because fear lurks   it sort of skirts around   someone describes it it's a bit like   sitting at a table and you can have   love and joy and happen all those things   sitting at the table   but fear comes to the table and he can't   sit   down unless you let one of those things   go like   faith or poop or joy or peace go   but he lurks around trying to come and   sit down   you have a choice you can either let him   in or you can rebuke him and tell him to   go running   that jesus you know has the victory   that's it but   it is a choice all the time for that but   i think   prayer is supernatural he can do an   amazing thing that   we can't do over that but thank you for   your concern and i'm doing really   well now thank you i'm so glad that i   love how you just put that the table i   i've never thought about it like that or   heard that said but that's so true   something has to go for fear to come in   and i've seen that time and time again   i'll let joy go   for fear to come sit and i'm like wait i   don't i don't want this i don't need   this like bring joy back but you have to   be serious about it it has to be a   choice   well i love what you said nikki about   sitting with pippa   for 11 nights and how you'd rather be   uncomfortable with her than comfortable   without her because it leads me to my   next question   about how y'all did the bible and when   your commentary together   and i have to say i love listening to it   on the bible app like i listen to it   every time because y'all's voices are so   sweet   and i love when she says peppa ads and   then pivot adds a little thing at the   end and it's always just so sweet but   what was the importance see all that you   all did that together   and why did y'all want to do tackle the   bible in a year commentary together   well ever since i encountered jesus   which is   quite a long time ago every day pretty   much   um i've i've wanted all relationships   thrive on communication   you know that that's the key to every   every human relationship is   communication   and it's the same with your relationship   with god and   it's more important that god speaks to   you   than that you speak to god and the main   way that god speaks to you is through   the bible well   so god originally spoke to me through   reading the bible that's how i   encountered jesus   so every day since then i want to keep   that communication up   i want to keep that relationship up so   about   30 years ago i was given the bible in   one year which is like a psalm   a bit of new testament bit of old   testament and i started reading it and i   and i have done ever since   i mean every day for the last 30 years   and about 13 years ago i think it was   maybe 12 or 13 years ago   someone who'd done alpha said could you   help me i'm trying to read the bible and   i can't find any way to   to get into it i'm finding it really   difficult so i said well   i'll do some notes each day from the   bible in one year   um and so we i i just did some notes for   him really   and for the rest of the congregation and   i did it on january the 1st   and pippa wrote something as well and   someone said yes   right my bit it was a sort of joke at   first because nick has spent   hours of fear you know some commentaries   and all these serious things   should i just add a bit it's just sort   of a jig   um and i don't know somehow it's all   sort of stuck and come together but if i   was given a dollar   for all the people who say to me i don't   really read your bit i just skip your   bit i go straight down to the people   i would be a rich man is so   great i love it it's always the best fit   everyone says   it's the best fit it makes us laugh it's   it's so   real it's so human it's my favorite bit   definitely   it is so funny because yours is so deep   and   so great and so put together and then i   love it's like   let me just add a very real note real   fast about life   it's so great i love it oh man it's so   good   so you kind of might have answered this   in that because of how much you read   um but one of my questions for you   personally because you know i   preach a lot of different sermons and i   study a lot for them   whenever i watch a sermon you've done i   love it because one it's filled with   like stories of you   your life you and pippa's life it's   really fun but it's also   so deep you have so many quotes from   people so   when you're about to go into a message   how do you   study for a message well   no i'm saying i think you're you are   such an anointed preacher you are   you're an amazing communicator and it   definitely wouldn't be for me to tell   you   anything i have quite the reverse i   could learn from you you're i think   you're a phenomenal   communicator and as you know and i i was   yeah i'm still hoping you'll come back   to the uk and we want you back we do too   we actually said we're like hoping to   come back and we   were like this would be great if our   little girl learns to talk there so   she'll talk like y'all   so we're just gonna let her hang out   with pippa all day long   so she'll talk like peppa we would love   that we would love that i mean i i   the thing what i i always say to   to the to the young guys by guys i mean   men and women here who are preaching   five five things first of all think   yourself empty in other words   everything you can think about that   subject write down you don't have to do   these   you don't have to do it in this order   but think yourself empty read yourself   full   read around the subject i mean how   amazing that how much research you did   for this   conversation i really take my hat off to   you salute you for that that is   so it's so obvious you've done that and   that's hard work   read yourself full write yourself clear   when you're starting   to speak you know writing makes you   clear   write yourself clearly be on a computer   not necessarily yeah   and that'd be a little bit easier   endlessness pray yourself pray yourself   hot   and set yourself free wow so at the end   of the day you just   just go for it but there's those are the   five things i think every talk should   every every that's that would be my tip   for if you're preparing at all   that is so good i would say that's   brilliant as y'all would say   um that whenever i was there i remember   telling you i said   i want to start saying things like you   say like brilliant and then   pippa you're so sweet you said but you   say really cool things too like awesome   i was like it's not as cool but no i   love that that's so good i'm definitely   going to take that advice and i know so   many people are because people ask me   that a lot how do you study and   i've not given anybody a clear answer   because i'm   all over the place but when i think   about it it all does fall under those   five   categories it's not that i can say do   this do this do this but just   read read read study study study pray   pray pray   all the things that you just said so   it's so cool well i have one more final   question for y'all and it kind of goes   back to what i said at the beginning it   you know i'll say to people um when   people ask me who do i look up to or   who somebody's impacting my life i often   times say   the two of you because of what that time   in london really taught me and christian   about the church about ministry just   watching you two up close for just even   a few days   and again people will say well who is   that and   then i say the alpha course and   everybody's like oh   or i'll say the bible in one year and   everybody's like oh or i'll say   you know you've written several   bestseller books and they're like oh   okay cool and i thought that that was so   cool that people   you know know these resources but   sometimes don't always know your name   and i want to live a life like that you   know i want people to   you know know the things i've done for   jesus and it doesn't really matter   what my name is you know and so how do   you   build something that's bigger than   yourself or start something that's   bigger   than your name gosh i don't know   sadie we've just done whatever we've   been in front of us to do   i think we never set out we run a local   church   and that's been amazing and then when   alpha started   we started this course for   non-christians in our church   and we never planned it to be for   anything other than   in our church here wow um but as it   grew um then people started asking   us how to run it so we thought oh well   maybe we should do a conference   and then um then we sort of opened up to   a conference and a thousand   some churches turned up we thought oh   lots of people are interested in this   you know and and then we found being in   london too people come here and then   they go back to kenya or they get back   to america or they go back to australia   and suddenly it's it's all over the   place and i it   felt as though the holy spirit has sort   of run ahead of us it's not that   so much that we've set out to do all   this but the holy spirit   has just done these things and we've   tried to run and catch up and   and try not to get in the way but try   and do what we believe that   that god is leading us to do or leading   the church to do   it's amazing i think that's so good   because i think a lot of people   when they start something they you know   sometimes get ahead   of the holy spirit and say well i'm   going to do this and it's going to be   global and it's going to be amazing and   everybody's going to love it   but whenever what y'all were doing was   respond to what you saw the church   needed it was a response to   something that you two needed when y'all   were you know   trying to find jesus and and you   answered that response in your heart   and because it was needed and it was a   tool for the church to use   it exploded and people have found so   much   you know honestly life through it   because i found jesus   and so for those of you who are   listening that have never heard of the   alpha course i   highly recommend it last night as i was   watching the   video through alpha i couldn't stop like   i woke up this morning watching more i   was like   because i was learning so much and i've   been in church my whole life but   this really is different than just a   church sermon it's for the person who   doesn't believe it's for the person who   doesn't you know doesn't necessarily   want to go into a church yet like   it's for you and also if if you are a   christian if you're put into church and   you're trying to   maintain that relationship with god they   also have the bible and when your   commentary it's on the bible app you can   also buy the hard copy they have so many   resources they put out   nikki's written several books and so i   just couldn't shout out   more the things that y'all are doing i   think y'all are such humble incredible   leaders   and christian and i are thankful for   your leadership and just thankful for   how y'all have believed in   me and us and all the things so thank   you all for taking time to just   pour out some of your wisdom on this   podcast and i hope this is just the   start for people   to learn from you guys oh sadie   well we absolutely love and admire you   and your family   your whole family amazing absolutely   amazing examples   and the influence that you are having is   is so   impressive and you're using it in such a   humble godly way and   and you are so anointed and the way that   you speak   you preach you speak the gospel you tell   you tell people about jesus and the holy   spirit   has anointed you to preach good news   particularly to this generation which is   why   we would love you to come back to   england i think you will have a huge   uh impact on the young people in this   country and we really need   they really need to hear good good role   models   of faith and you and christian are such   good role models   to people to learn from so thank you for   all you're doing and we really   we really honor you for what you're   doing thank you so much that means so   much to me and trust me   just because we're having a baby does   not mean that changed our plans we still   want to come to london and we would love   to pour into people there   and vice versa so i hope to see you guys   soon   and sooner than later for sure but we   love you guys thank y'all again   god bless much          hi hey is this emma yup   hey this is sadie and christian how you   doing   i'm good how are you guys doing good   christian's fantastic   um good we're doing great yeah so what's   your question that you sent in   um my question was what to look for that   makes someone marriage material   oh i like that that's a loaded question   are you are you currently single or   dating   yes i'm single right now i just got out   of a long relationship   oh wow well sorry to hear that but hey i   always say breakups get you where you're   going they're necessary   they're hard but they're necessary that   is true um   and you know this is the perfect time   now that you're single to just   get in that state of like asking   yourself what is marriage material what   am i looking for and going in with   intention but babe do you want to start   it off   yeah that's good um and emma yes such a   great question   i think for me that the the two things i   think of first one is consistency   um i think that if you can find someone   who's consistent   with um the way they treat you the way   that they   treat their friends the way that they   are with their parents and the way that   they   are just all around with consistency   because   you know you could date somebody for six   months and then they can be an amazing   person for six months then after that   they're not the person that they were   when you first started dating so   i think over time just look for those   consistent qualities and i also think   someone   who um has integrity and who lives with   conviction and who um you know is always   in for your best interest and wouldn't   um   you know would fear the lord before they   feared what what um   the other person would think of them so   for me i think consistency   that person who's always going to be   there for you and integrity   knowing that you can trust them and not   you know feel like you have to   wonder or stress about what they're   doing or what they're watching or   um that's so good babe because used to   you know i would date guys i'd be so   worried about like who they're following   what they're looking at and i would   like step in and try to control that   it's like hey i see you're following   this person can you unfollow them i had   to say all that stuff   and and they would but it's like you   want somebody   that's like you don't have to say that   it's like they're just   doing that because of their own   integrity because   of their own relationship with the lord   and like they're not just changing   because of you they're   they've already been changed because of   jesus and so with christian like i   didn't have to say like can you do this   you did this and you do this like   because i i could just gladly   welcome him to be who he is and who he's   called to be   and i could be in relationship with that   because   it aligned with you know my relationship   with the lord it didn't   take away from my relationship with the   lord and so that's what i would say is   just   somebody pursuing god someone who's been   pursuing god   um and then can also pursue you out of   that pursuit   i think pursuit is something that is so   important   and i think it should be something that   never dies i think oh sorry   we have this giant fly flying material   literally yeah   marriage materials wow someone who can   kill a fly with their hand that just i   think you can't see   us but christian just killed a fly with   his hands   sorry okay put the fly away i'm   finishing this this is good   really cool someone who can kill a fly   emma someone who can kill a fly   yeah you want a man um but yeah   somebody's   pursuing the lord and then lastly i   would say which   obviously these are just a few things   there are so many things i think more   than making like a checklist   you know you need to like actually think   about the heart of the person that   you're going to be with   and just the qualities that you're going   to see in them but one thing i would say   is just   intentionality and it's kind of funny   because my dad always makes fun of   christian for   how much he says the word intentionally   all right he says   yeah he's making fun of me for that you   didn't know that i kind of knew that i   know that was like the   root of the word that was that is what   cause christian always says like   let's just be intentional or trying to   be intentional or the intentionality   like he says that all the time   but christian says that because that's   how he   is he's so intentional with his words   with how he   listens with how he um steps into   moments   who he calls when he calls them and i   think intentionality is a really   huge quality to look for in someone   because they're going to be intentional   with you   and your time and your heart um and so   you know that that's really important   and i think one thing to look at   whenever you start dating someone is   maybe like a month or two months in like   just take a self-evaluation like am i a   better person and closer to the lord   because this person or   am a less version of myself and further   away and if you're better   and if you're pursuing god harder then i   would say hey that's that's marriage   material right there   um so i know you just got out of a   relationship you're single   enjoy this time of just you doing those   old things in your heart you know   become a more intentional person become   someone with an integrity pursue the   lord now   and then whenever you have a guy come   into the picture you'll be able to see   it clearly because   you will have already done it but i hope   that encourages you today   and i look forward to your future story   and all the things that   god's gonna do with your life um because   you're in an exciting time i know   singleness can   seem like something you dread but it's   actually such a gift and so enjoy it   and enjoy what god begins to write with   your story   yeah thank you guys so much i appreciate   it yeah thanks   thanks for sending in your
