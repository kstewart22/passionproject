hey what's up guys so today we're going to be shooting a little video are you a pregnant woman what's up guys Natan Sutton back with another video and today we are talking about Jehovah's Witnesses what they believe in and how you can respond and they come knocking at your door and don't pretend you weren't like that little intro we ever did everyone does that now that might have been a little extreme but I think most people when they hear when I hear that Jehovah's Witnesses are in the hood they start hiding and I think it's kind of because they don't really know who they are what they believe in how to defend the faith from their perspective so that's our goal with this video is to just give you enough information to walk away with it you can be prepared next time you encounter a Jehovah's Witness and show them the truth but before we get started we did want to touch real quickly on the video we made previously about the Mormon community you know when we post that video we got a lot of hate a lot of negative comments on that and a lot of people were saying why don't you just talk about your own beliefs and leave ours out of it or don't be talking about ours but really we were thinking about it I like it if we did that that's literally the least loving thing we could do you know if we believe that there's only one true God and one Jesus and one way to get to heaven how could we not tell you that how could we ever be silent about that I think that would just be a horrible thing yeah it's kind of like seeing someone standing on the edge of a cliff that's about to jump off of course you're gonna go and try to save that person but by not speaking out not speaking the truth it's kind of just being like oh I'll just let them jump off I don't wanna upset them we understand that some of our videos are gonna upset people our heart and goal behind this channel is to reach the lost people who are being led astray and guide them to the truth so to start us out why don't you tell us who are the Jehovah's Witnesses yeah so the Jehovah's Witnesses they came to be in the mid to late 1800s and so just a little under 200 years ago so not very old at all and according to JW org Jehovah's Witnesses org there are about 8.4 million of them in the world today and I think they're actually growing really fast the Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus was a created being and he was the first and greatest creation of God they do believe in the Bible they like the King James Version but they do have their own version that they go by which is called the New World Translation the fact that Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe that Jesus is God and that he was a created being is one of the most significant things know about them and when engaging in a conversation with them it's also very important to know that they don't believe Jesus even claimed to be equal with God and one of our biggest questions that comes to our minds and that we have for our Jehovah's Witnesses is that if you don't believe that Jesus claimed to be God then why was he crucified you know that's the whole reason he was crucified is because he was he was ticking everyone off that he was claiming to be God as with every religion the Jehovah's Witnesses it's very complex and telling you all the information about them is a different video for a different day the intention of the video that we are making today is to just give you a little bite-sized blip of information that you can walk away from this video with knowing what to say when the Jehovah's Witnesses come knocking at your door and the first suggestion that we have if they come knocking at your door is to start the conversation off with a prayer so you pray for God to reveal the truth to both of you throughout your conversation and not saying that you're going to convince them in this one conversation to believe what you believe or they're gonna convince you to believe what they believe but you could at least plant a seed hopefully and after you have your prayer with them we want to give you two questions to ask the Jehovah's Witness and one Bible passage to show them afterwards the two questions to ask is number one do you believe Jesus is equal with God and they'll give you a big fat no as an answer and then question number two is if Jesus was equal with God what would that mean allow them to answer this question and they may not answer but their answer would basically be the way reveal that their teaching is false so more than likely they're going to show up to your door carrying a New World Translation Bible which is not your typical Bible it's actually a corrupted version of the actual Bible where passages have been added and changed around to support their beliefs so obviously in our Bible it shows that Jesus is equal with God time and time again but even in their Bible the New World Translation there's still one Bible passage that shows that Jesus is claiming to be equal with God and that's the one that we want you to bring up to them in John 5 jesus heals a man on the Sabbath so the Pharisees confronted him about it and asked him why are you healing this man on the Sabbath you know that's not allowed and the way that Jesus responds to them actually shows that He is God yeah and we want to be clear that there are many passages in the Bible that show Jesus claiming to be God but this is the one that even the Jehovah's Witness Bible has slipped through the cracks and that's what we want to show you so in verses 16 and 17 of John chapter 5 their translation reads this this is their translation for this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus because he was doing these things during the Sabbath but he answered them my father has kept working until now and I keep working and then he explains what he means by that in the following verse he says this is why the Jews began seeking all the more to kill him because not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was also calling God his own father making himself equal to God right there it says it in plain text making himself equal to God so show them that and then Jesus even goes on in verse 23 he says so that all may honor the son just as they honor the father whoever does not honor the son does not honor the father who sent him so here we see not only Jesus declaring himself equal with the father but also showing that he deserves to be worshipped like the father so the first is that we want you guys to remember to bring up to the Jehovah's Witnesses when they knocking at your door is John 5:18 and 23 which is the verse that slipped through the cracks into their Bible about Jesus claiming to be equal with God which technically goes against everything that they believe so bring that verse up to them see what they have to say you may not convert them right on the spot you probably won't but hopefully you will at least plant a seed which got my water over time and eventually reveal to them who Jesus is and the truth yes yes all right guys this was a short and sweet video and our hope and prayer for it is that it just gives you a little something to be prepared next time they come knocking at your door this is Nate Sutton sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one buta time and that was what to say when jehovah's witnesses come knocking at the door all right what's up guys hey play the camera said today's today's a little different we're gonna be doing an interview I'm gonna be interviewing Sutton my pregnant wife we're gonna nail it with the questions a little nervous very put on the spot but before we begin why don't you stand up show me a little bump some how pretty you are you see my whole body all that that little bump update is 30 weeks so cute okay so let's get started well first off like I say that you are a very pretty pregnant woman thank you that's beautiful pregnant woman I've ever seen first question do you like being pregnant I do like being pregnant I feel like I liked it more with Oakland then I do this time but with him I was going to weddings and everyone's like sit down and rest and have something to drink and are you hungry and everyone's just so nice to you I think that's the best part but it seems like you also have a lot of things that you don't like about it but overall you're saying that you do like it we're all yeah I like it all right I'm forming life how could you not like this well that kind of leaves me one of my other questions is that if you can skip pregnancy and just have the baby like the baby just pop out of thin air would you do that or do you like the process of being pregnant that makes me think of like is it called a surrogate when they carry your baby for you like if it's something like that I would say I want to be the one pregnant but if it's like literally my our baby and gods just handing it to me and then maybe I would just skip it all I was getting that so that's more instant gratification you know it's like you want a baby here's a baby you know eight nine months but a lot of us need these months to prepare I feel very unprepared if that's a question what do you have to prepare for his room is a mess all we have is a crude put it together and that's it what is the slash hardest easiest and hardest thing about being pregnant the easiest thing is eating all the food I feel like it's like encouraged for you to eat more because you know you're feeding for two that's the best part and the hardest thing is just I guess what it does to your body my bones are moving around and everything's getting looser making room for him and it does not feel good I got popping going on by my tailbone it just doesn't feel this what have you been eating that you feel guilt free about that you may not normally brownies every day twice a day which means I've been eating em too yeah they cut this out yeah saw me with Oakland I think my food was egg sandwiches which aren't really that bad but what this baby I feel like it's brownies that's just what I want all the time and I already love brownies but not every day are you self-conscious about the way you look being pregnant um naked yes I would say I don't know probably so I don't know if it's self-conscious but I do feel like anything I put on doesn't look good so I don't know if that's considered self-conscious or not but yeah I just feel like I can't ever like dress cute I want to what do you think you're fat or do you think that you're like wouldn't you self-conscious about like not looking good good I just feel like when I put clothes on and they don't fit me right all right they always have to be like frumpy and Biggs I just didn't really buy any maternity clothes which I guess is my fault then I just don't feel that good one of my questions was do people treat you differently being crazy kind of into earlier but how do people treat you definitely yes everyone treats you differently and it's so nice but eventually think like why don't we all just treat you like that anyways like why needs to be pregnant to get treated so nicely but everybody's so nice they just like when I go to weddings like I said they just sort of saying sit down and rest and how do you feel and here some food have some water and I'm like I can't sit down like I'm trying to work and then people just random people at stores and stuff will talk to you how wouldn't you do you look so cute things like that but if you're not pregnant they don't really talk to you strangers will don't really talk to you which is kind of funny because I've noticed since not only having a wife but having a kid I feel like people perceive me so differently and treat me so much nicer like they trust me more I think where like if I would be walking down the street or down the road before I met set and I felt like people like look at me like who's this guy but now that I have a wife a kid isn't even a pregnant wife it's like he's he's safe territory he's a friendly guy well you do have a permanent smile on your face I feel like I didn't people didn't pay attention at before what would you say is your favorite thing and your least favorite thing about being pregnant well that kind of went with that other question about the food and the back issues my favorite thing my favorite thing is eating I know you're gonna say like healing the baby no well that do that is pretty cool sometimes it's kind of aggravating like when you're trying to sleep and stuff you know he'll like kick me and keep me awake sometimes but my lazier thing I can change that so besides my back pain my least favorite thing is restless legs I've been having restless legs at night and it's horrible and if any of you don't know what that is it's like where you feel this urge to move your legs and there's literally nothing you can do about it like they're gonna move I'll try to fight it I'm just gonna I'm just like I'm not gonna give in I'm not gonna move and then they'll just like spaz and kick and kick and you can't sleep how much weight have you gained oh this is a shocker I've gained 30 pounds 30 Wow and I'm 30 weeks so apparently stomach literally I feel like the rest of your body has stayed the same well that's the goal but that's but also probably why my back hurts so bad what has been the most like the most unexpected thing about being pregnant well something recently that happened that was unexpected to me was we got a doula which I didn't go into it expecting that we were gonna do that but after last experience I really feel like it's gonna be a good idea and what does it do laughs for those that don't know a doula is someone who I would say what she said yesterday you know they dual is someone that this is kind of like with you through the pregnancy process they come to appointments if you want them to they answer your questions they come to your birth and she's just kind of there as like an advocate for you which I feel like we really needed that last time because we didn't know what was going on but they know what's going on and they know like your rights and things that you can decline and stuff like that all these things that we don't really know about and they're educated on like what's going on with your body when you're having a baby and I just think that we really nice to know what's going on because the last experience we were is in the dark like no one was telling us what was going on or why things were happening and she was saying that the unknown creates fear in you which I definitely believe and then like knowledge gives you strength and knowing like okay we talked about this I know what's going on I know why I'm feeling this way and I believe that is the first time being pregnant is the second time being pregnant harder I'd say the second time is harder because the first time I was just napping whenever I want to and not sitting on the floor playing with another kid and not picking up another kid but now all day I'm picking up Oakland carrying around of 25 pound kid and you know that's not easy I went back and already I have so much weight on my front and I'm holding him on my front so it's a lot of bending down and standing up and like all these movements that I didn't have to do before and I think so yeah I guess cuz you know what to expect and everything so it's easier and we didn't really give my body much time to come back like bounce back from Oakland because it we got pregnant when I was six months old so that's probably another problem she's going through the gauntlet and well I guess whatever you want to say that we're gonna have two babies under two yes that's right what I'm most nervous about is the transition of one to two his parents say that the hardest transition was none to one and then my parents our sisters say the hardest transition was from like one to two are like going from one to multiples because you're not just worried about one kid now you're like you each have a kid kind of to take care of you can't just take turns do you have any advice for a future pregnant women my advice would be I would say throughout your pregnancy I just think everyone should do it their own way like everyone has an opinion and everyone has like the right way to do it or like the best way to do it but I just feel like everybody's different and what's good for you may not be good for somebody else like as far as doulas and midwives and epidurals and hospitals and home births and water births there's just like so many options and no one really guiding you through it so I'll just say do your own research don't go off everyone else's story because everyone's different and just have your own experience the way that you want to mm-hmm sounds like good advice for a lot of things in life do you think I'm helpful like in my pregnancy yeah well how could you be helpful you know I mean you know I do give you massages oh yeah I'd like me like although I wasn't fishing today ask you what I do was helping you just say if you think I'm helpful if not well I'm just thinking of like all this weight I'm carrying around like how do you help me carry it but you told yeah you do help me because my back hurts and you give me massages and you watch Oakland at night for like an hour and a half so I can do my little stretches of make sure you let them know how a little time and watch them I play that's a long time yeah I mean when I'm up there spend an hour and a half of myself I'm like yes it's so nice I don't think I met you most moms don't get that hour and a half to themselves I guess we'll find out yeah I Rosa the comments he's doing he's working so he has a job how do you think I would handle being in your shoes not all guys in my life that I've known are just like not that tough when it comes to physical things I I don't know that I could handle it that you could handle it that I can hang that's pretty bad but I think something I do think about you is that the move I think you'd be amazed at like every little thing like the movements every time you moved I think you'd play feel this you believe this what's the scariest thing about being pregnant I think the scariest thing is like fear of the unknown you know not knowing when I'm gonna go into labor and if it's gonna be on time and like I think I feel fear around if he's gonna come too early or something's gonna be wrong with him when he comes out and he's not gonna be perfectly healthy things like that but to alleviate the fear I think prayer is like my biggest go-to because I feel like I say a lot of prayers about him and his health and him staying in there as long as he can and everything just go and smooth we pray for each body part and his personality to this heart I can ask you a question what I don't know put the script on me how do you feel about being the dad of a pregnant I mean the a dad and you're about to be a dad chuckles - yeah oh I'm pretty happy about it I yeah I love Oakland he's so much fun but I am a little worried about our relationship here's an Oakland sir new baby mine yours oh I don't know I just wonder like what we have any time together yeah well as best as we can but yeah have as much time together and what we'd be you know when we're trying to run a business or and try and take care two kids are we gonna get frustrated easily those are things like I have concerns about but mostly I'm excited I can't wait for Oakland and have a little friend and I've always pictured myself with two boys so to see that come to fruition I'm excited which is so funny we've been talking about it that I we just picture our next baby looking completely different than Oakland like dark hair dark eyes but that's what we thought Oakland was gonna look like - so what's y'all's against what do y'all think he's gonna like speaking of what he looks like next week we're actually going to get his 3d ultrasound and I think we're gonna vlog that experience so you'll get to see that yeah this is Natan sudden sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one Beauty time and that was me interviewing my beautiful pregnant wife kay okay you want to show them how good you can walk oh good you being silly let's show how you can walk good look at him go big man we're gonna go see your brother today yeah we're gonna go see your brother today what's his name what's his name tell everyone what his name is hey I'm not telling his name   I'm not saying his name I'm gonna hit mama okay you can't be being mean on the camera you gotta show them how perfect of a family we are       that's funny this is Sutton's mom look how much they look alike that's my future my future right today is the day we see our baby oh I told you there's cows over here oh yeah there are cows they don't care about cows today's the day that we go see our baby you don't know the name of our baby yet we're going to do a 3d ultrasound we did this with Oakland - and with Oakland we did it at 32 weeks and this would tomorrow I turned 31 weeks ahsha's oh come on yeah we went to go to see Oakland he had his hand in front of his face which is funny because he does that all the time now yeah I hope that this baby is good it's so funny yeah 3d ultrasound is so funny because with in Oakland I felt like it showed us what he look like but it didn't really show somebody you know I looking back on I thought yeah that's kind of look like them but I feel like it made me think he was gonna look a lot different than he did yeah I just might the only features you can really tell I was like nose and lips and that's pretty much a sore eyes are closed I don't know the shape he thought they have hair or anything so but it's still fun it is kind of fun we've barely had any ultrasounds for this baby so I'm excited and it's funny because we're getting ready to go to eat right now where Sutton's Waterboro oh and this is the shirt I had on yes it is I don't know I just thought of that knowledge you said that I mean I wear that shirt because that's one of the few that fits me what made pregnant was comfortable but when he said where our water go goes like oh this is what I had on one and these pants anyway we'll have to film the exact spot that's that's water but furtive you go to the novella by Sherman Angel you can avoid this deceit any other people out there want to break in a restaurant now would like to know that I was on him after my water broke that is surprising how often we don't see that happen you know like no I don't know is either no his water breaks out public I guess hey everybody my water just broke public service announcement you see that puddle that's me so if any of y'all did have your water break in public tell us where it was I that's interesting I want to know all right show us the spot that that chair right there is so wet you can see the water I had to brag on my wife for a second we were just we were just getting finished eating at now mushroom and she was waiting outside the bathroom for me because she's waiting for me like she always does and there was this lady who came outside that saw her she said what'd she say so I had walked outside cuz I was waiting and I thought he was outside waiting on me so I went outside and I'm waiting out there for him and this lady like follows me outside and she was like I just saw you you are so beautiful thank you that's so nice and I'm serious you're the most pretty pregnant person I've ever seen or something like that that's what she said I just had to brag on my wife yeah they made pizza cookin yeah awful pizza and he's moving around like a crazy yeah I used to make the joke every time we would eat not a mushroom Oakland he did all the things that I like the best number two's doing the same thing here we go let's go see you squish little nose so what do you think that was so fun you little man it's so fun to see him and then like think back to at Oakland's and see how they were there it just blows my mind that we are gonna make a different kid like this is not good so I know when I was looking at him I kept thinking I was like looking at Oakland but it's totally different baby we can't wait to meet him we should show a picture of him and Oakland compared to each other like you guys think he's gonna be a little blondie and blue.i baby like Oakland or his own person we think he's gonna be dark hair dark eyes next time you see him it'll be in person on the video in real life it's so weird I know we got what two more months I'm 31 weeks so I had Oakland at 30 the day before 39 weeks so not much lawyer if everything goes according to plan we'll be seeing him in two months crazy and then she said everything looks healthy thank God I'm so thankful for that yes okay I see your brother baby baby baby flip the page what do you think Oh alright guys what I'm about to tell you you're not going to hear on the news you're not going to hear it on the news because it's not going to feed your panic it's going to feed your peace for many of us our problems are not the problem our anxiety about our problems are the problem let me repeat for many of us our problems are not the problem our anxiety about the problems or the problem and hear me clearly don't hear what I'm not saying I'm not trying to downplay or undermine the severity of the situation going on in our world right now I'm not saying people aren't facing real problems right now people are getting sick people are dying people are losing their jobs but for the vast majority of us that's not the case for the vast majority of us our problem right now is our anxiety about our potential problems and that's what jesus warned us about in matthew chapter 6 he says do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body but he tells us to seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to us there's nothing more that the enemy wants to do than to fill you with so much anxiety with the things of this present world so that it makes you take your eyes off God and Luke 8 Jesus shares a parable and says that the Word of God is like a seed and that he wants to plant that seed deep in the soul up here at heart and as you hear his words that the seed is going to burst into life and grow and flourish but he says that there's going to be challenges in that garden and one of the challenges is as that seed starts to grow a weed is going to come and choke the life out of it his disciples asked him what is the weed that choke the life out of it out of the seed and he said it is the worries of this life and that's why many of us are not experiencing the power of God is because the word of life is getting choked by the worries of life one of the biggest issues with anxiety is that it will begin to cause you to make wrong choices in life anxiety about finances can lead you to make unethical decisions it can lead you down the path of addiction just to escape and the scary thing is that anxiety can literally kill you it's argue that the number one cause of disease and illnesses are stress-related even as I'm working on this video we received a message from a girl on Instagram telling us how she has had so much anxiety about this whole thing that it's literally making her sick and the craziest thing about it all is that these hypothetical situations and our minds are killing us in reality your real life and real health can be affected by these hypothetical situations that may or may not ever be speaking to my fellow Christians for a second the world is not impressed when we sing about the Prince of Peace but live lives of stress but as followers of Jesus we're supposed to live differently we are not supposed to live anxious and stressed out do you know what the most frequent command and the Bible is do not be afraid one of our all-time favorite verses in the Bible is do not be anxious about anything but in everything through prayer and petition with Thanksgiving let your requests be known Philippians 4:6 we're not saying you don't care about anything it's that you don't obsess and have this anxious filled worried about something that whenever you encounter a thing whether it be the virus the economy the media finances relationships health you present it before God through prayer and Thanksgiving for what you do have and that the God of peace will hear you out and fill you with his peace now when I say the way to cure your anxiety is the prayer many of you might write me off because we've heard it so many times but let me ask you to analyze your own coping methods of anxiety and how is it working out for you many of us eat our anxiety away or we run the social media and scroll or maybe bury it with an addiction if your methods aren't working out for you maybe it's time you give this a try what I love about that verse is that the word Lent he could have said make your requests known to God but no he said let your requests be known to God that means that these anxieties of ours want to come out they naturally want to and you don't have to force them so next time you are tempted to force whatever it is you're anxious about down let them come up and present them to God let it all come out no matter how ugly it is down on the inside let it come out before the Lord he wants you to do that not only does he want you he commands you to do that first Peter 5:7 says cast your anxieties on him because he cares for you Psalm 55:22 cast her cares upon the Lord he will sustain you he will never let the righteous fall God is strong enough to do something about our anxieties and he's loving enough to want to remember that the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus the next word is Philippians 4:8 finally brothers and sisters whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is excellent praiseworthy think about such things so that's the one-two punch you release and then you embrace you release your anxieties and lay them before God and then when your mind calms down you then embrace his truce and put on the mind of Christ through his word it's kind of like a child when your child comes to you begging they're all whacked out of their mind dad I want to snack I want to snack I want a snack I want a snack on his neck you make them calm down first and then you feed them and it's actually a little insulting if you think about it like does the child actually think they're going to starve have you ever let them starve before in a similar way it's the same thing with our Heavenly Father it's honoring to him when you come with a peaceful mind because it says a lot about what you think about him as a father one-two punch cast your anxieties and then embrace his truths now are we going to live problem-free lives of course not we are dealing with a world crisis as we speak but the crisis of today is not bigger than the cross of Christ and what he did for us no matter what happens today or tomorrow we have the assurance of where we are headed we are either heading home to our family and loved ones or we are heading home to our Heavenly Father either way it's good news set your minds on the things above and not beneath think about these things and let them shape your lives and the way you live in verse 9 he finishes and says whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in me put it into practice and the God of peace will be with you so you can't just hear what I'm saying here and be good you have to practice it you have to live it that's the word the media won't tell you release your anxieties to him embrace histories and go out and live ike many people left everyone don't worked about then anyone have faith anymore I don't

think of all time all time I mean like every video we make someone is commenting asking us this question and then on Instagram we have hundreds of messages with this question so we're answering it today   so how did we do it you know as you know as you can see from our intro some of our past travel videos me and Sutton we love to travel together it's something that we are very passionate about and as you guys know we were virgins when we got married so how did we do it how did we travel all these exotic romantic destinations and remain virgins and we're gonna tell you how we did it but before we get into that we want to tell you about this app called pray calm yes and we're really excited about this sponsor because they support what we believe in and it can be very difficult for Christian youtubers to get sponsorships because of our beliefs yeah so pretty calm is an app that is basically like a all-inclusive religious Bible app it's really cool they have Bible stories they have daily prayers they have Bible stories for little kids like cater to little kids even Bible stories for bedtime which are like really soothing it's got the soothing voice and background noises and stuff it's really interesting which I'm really excited about the car rides because with Oakland we always turn on these stupid cartoons and all all of you know baby but now we're gonna be doing Bible pray calm is the number one app for daily prayers and bedtime Bible stories and we're gonna put a flow code on the screen and how you do this is you open up the camera on your phone and hold your phone up to the code it will scan it and a banner will pop down to ask you to download the app and they're making it super simple for you guys to get it to yes and go check it out by supporting them you're supporting us and believe me we're not gonna be promoting something to you guys that we don't think is really cool so you can feel rest assured that whatever we bring up on this channel is gonna be of some good quality now into the juicy stuff all right here we go so as you guys know not too long after me and Sutton that we took a road trip to California a two-week trip to Cal we live in Georgia to California back we took a road trip through Canada and Montana later on and so we really just loved exploring the world together and going on trips I mean what's funnier than that right the question is how do you do it remain a virgin yeah so that's the tricky part we actually had a really interesting thing into our California trip I feel like right before we went on our trip our two-week road trip that God gave me an epiphany and the epiphany was that we need to drive the speed limit the entire trip under the speed limit so could you imagine driving from one side of the country to the other and back going under the speed limit the whole way people were just flying passes because you I mean there are roads that it's just like nothingness and you're just on this road alone and we're going this is yeah it was so random but I feel like God was telling me that by doing this it's going to be a constant reminder that you guys are gonna be taking the narrow path you're gonna be honoring God throughout this whole relationship I want he wants us to honor him throughout our entire trip and it'll just be a constant reminder while everyone's it and past us everyone the whole whole world there you are yeah we're not gonna be going with the flow of the world it's pretty much what the whole thing was and I thought that was really cool although I don't think you liked it too much well it was more time together so I mean we would have done the trip way faster no man you look at your GPS and it's like 13 hours to Texas and it's like oh my goodness or about me the speed limit the whole way going together on a road trip just the two of you and spending that much alone time together is really shredding the line of good and bad I feel like because you're putting yourself into some really tempting situations and it's you two all the time and for us even places that we went there were public places nobody was there there's like nobody around and so she's it was always just us and yeah you're putting yourself at tender situations and as fun as it was I have to suggest that you just don't do it yeah I mean it is it's such a fun idea and really a fun great thing to do but we have to say that you need to wait till marriage to have a trip together like this if you're dating if you're in a relationship if you're engaged it's just nearly impossible to spend that much time too with each other especially in like exotic and romantic destinations that it's just you're putting yourself in a situation that is nearly impossible to get out alive even though that we did come out as virgins on the other side of our trips it doesn't mean that we made the best decision by taking that trip and we didn't put stumbling blocks in our way it's just not worth it if we could do it again we would wait for marriage and we suggest you do - mmm dark fun anyways is traveling while married oh yeah because then there's no batteries and you just do whatever you want I know you imagine at that waterfall with all that said if you must go against all wisdom and just you have to go on a trip together like we did we do have some suggestions for you because we know there's something you guys that are just gonna do it anyway so we do have some guidelines that will help you stay away from getting into the dirty ohhohh here alone together so tip number one as you just mentioned would just be to stay in separate rooms it's gonna be expensive but that's what you got to do if you're stuck on going on a trip together even if you get a room that has two separate beds just don't bother because you're gonna one of you is gonna end up in the other ones bed looks like let's just avoid it altogether tip number two is to vow to each other beforehand that you're not gonna be physical with each other so you know before the trip even begins you got to have an agreement and even promise to each other that we're gonna go on this trip together but we are not gonna be physical because if you're not on the same page with each other before the trip when you're there it's over you're gonna be physical with each other yeah you could also make some guideline like a rule like if if we do break this promise to each other and then blah blah blah what could it be name the consequence tip number three it would be if you guys are going to be in warm places where you're in bathing suits around each other - just try not to touch each other during that time yeah even holding hands or kissing each other if you're alone you know just picture it he told ya don't picture it but if you're in that kind of situation it's just it's just gonna lead to doing things that you don't want to do so maybe even the whole trip that could be a great boundary it's like hey we really want to experience this trip together we want to see the world and God's creation together but let's not make it a physical thing let's not hold hands let's not kiss you know just for the duration of that trip even because it can help set the standards high so that you don't fall into temptation that could also really help you guys to get to know each other a lot better - oh yeah if you're not focusing on being physical with each other you're gonna do a lot of talking mm-hmm tip number four is to make your trip less than a week because self-control can only go so far and the longer you stay on that trip together the more likely you are to fall into temptation yeah you know it's just not wise to put yourself in a situation where you know you're gonna fail or you're very likely going to fail so if you must make it less than a week and tip number five is to save this for marriage like we mentioned earlier we just really can't suggest doing it because ultimately your goal as a Christian couple should be to honor God with your relationship and that means to honor God with our bodies save that for marriage and going on a trip together yes it's so much fun and it's like amazing but it'll be even more amazing when you're married together and what'll be really cool is if you don't go on a trip together while dating then your first big trip together it's gonna be your honeymoon which would be so cool yeah that's true and then just imagine what you can do under that waterfall don't imagine it alright guys so that was a short and sweet video but it was a high end demand so we had to make it we hope this video could be an opportunity for you guys to learn from us learn from our mistakes and that if we could do it over again we would wait we wait to take that those trips when we got married this is Nate and Sutton sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one period of time and that was how old and we traveled the world together as virgins my hair white I'm in as far as I watch this Oh putting stumbling blocks in our way making it much      thumbs up t-cell what you ready no I'll check my own here touching the right things in this messed up alright what's up guys Natan Sutton back with another video and it is getting crazy out here we got a different background today it's not the crazy part no the crazy part is this quarantine stuff man what's funny is it's kind of our normal life we have recently taken it to new levels new levels what are the new levels the new levels is that we decided that we're not going to see anybody anymore so not our families or anyone and might that's really hard for me because my sister lives 10 houses down the road and I go over there like every day we let our kids play together so that's been sad it's only or on what day three I think yeah and the reason is because last week we had a scare last week just going about our normal lives and all of a sudden I wake up one morning and I'm feeling fever fever come on and I'm feeling body chills body aches headaches oh and I'm thinking I'm looking up symptoms for the corona virus and sure enough those are the symptoms early symptoms except I didn't have a coffee I didn't have a call for any sort of like runny nose or anything like that yeah I was like okay there's no way that I got this there's no way because I don't go anywhere like if anyone goes anywhere it's me yeah I mean like I went to the store once or twice to pick up something but I'm so careful and wash my hands and don't talk to anyone and I'm around nobody all day but anyway I started feeling these symptoms trying to come through the bugs I started getting nervous and let's just tell you the extremes that you go he went to pedes high which by the only place he's been to pick up pizza rest and he gets plastic grocery bags and puts them on his hands to open the door and to take the pizza box from the people because I don't have any stinking gloves so yeah like that's how careful I am as the day progressed I got worse and worse and to the point where I'm like I just got to lay down like I got to lay down I took a nap took some Tylenol felt a lot better but then it started going downhill again and that night was one of the worst nights of my life that was the first night in our whole marriage that we've been in the same place but sleeping in different spots like I slept Bernardo when he slept on the couch just all night body chills fever I was so hot and then so cold and so hot and so cold and I couldn't sleep and I was experiencing some serious spiritual warfare during this whole night - I think Satan was just trying to get at me because man I was crying I literally I was like crying of the thought that I was caught was convinced that I had this virus and I'm thinking oh this is the beginning of the end I'm gonna give it to Sutton she's pregnant she's gonna give it to our baby Oakland is gonna have it I'm gonna be in the hospital our parents they're old they're older they're gonna go downhill so fast all these thoughts it's amazing how your mind can take over if you let it or you let Satan speak to you so I woke up the next morning I'm like I got to go get tested I just got to know if I have it because if I do I really got it separate myself I go get tested and straight enough they tell me that I don't have enough symptoms to be even tested for the virus and that they would give me a flu test because they think I had the flu I'm like no way I have the flu I've never had the flu and what are the chances I have the flu right now during this whole outbreak yeah so sure enough I get tested and I have the flu never been so happy I was celebrating thanking God for this blue so what they were telling me was since I'm not considered high-risk and I wasn't experiencing all of the symptoms like a cough and whatnot that they weren't gonna even test me for the virus but they would give me a flu test the good news is what they said is that it's so unlikely to have the flu and the virus at the same time that it pretty much rules out the virus if you have the flu so if you're scared of the virus go get the flu yeah once we found that out he had we should he shot himself in a room upstairs by himself and it was for just for like two days but thinking of the people that do that for weeks yeah I don't know how they do it it was really hard I think for both of us yeah so that's why we're getting so serious about this thing is because apparently the virus is three times more contagious than the flu and to think that I got the flu with how careful I was being makes me think anybody can get the virus I mean no matter what so we're going to these extreme links of not being around a single person until this thing calmed down thank God we actually made it through his whole flu experience without me or was a miracle because literally the day before I mean we were kissing we were together 24/7 and like if I just don't understand like how did you get it without going anywhere and I'm with you all the time and which kind of is brings up this whole thing about Sutton being pregnant you're what 34 weeks pregnant now this week so we don't have much longer yeah so we pray that this whole thing is gone by the time she's delivering because we do not want to be in your hospital at that time I'm curious for anyone else other watching this like did anyone have a baby in March does anyone do in April and May I'm curious like what are you guys doing did you do a hospital did you do it at home and change your plans from the hospital did you do what May 13 yeah but it was a week early and I've heard your second one comes even earlier so little nervous but we actually switched hospitals because we have a doula now I think I mentioned that in another video and our current hospital was not allowing doulas anymore because they said that you only allowed your spouse and that's it so we switched hospitals and thankfully the one that we switched to the labor and delivery building is completely separate from the actual hospital building so I think that's gonna be a good move and they're gonna let our dual would be there for now but who knows you know the rules could change every day so this flu was a wake-up call for me you don't realize when you're all healthy and feeling good you're like yeah yeah the virus is for other people but I felt like it was a really big wake-up call for me because I'm thinking man like not only did I personally feel so bad but to think like our whole family had this and then we were all we were in the hospital especially that this going on the site and it was just like such a nightmare to have that that movie playing in my mind that I'm just like oh I will do anything staying at home and away from people that's like this is a joy compared to having to go through this sickness I watched a video this doctor on YouTube earlier and he was saying one of the worst parts about this whole thing is that when people drop off their loved ones that have the virus and them having to separate for weeks and not knowing if they'll ever see them again yeah leave them there by themselves in their room full of other sick people like how miserable is and especially you know the hospitals are just getting more full and full and another life update is how this isn't impacted our business so for those of you that know us we have our own wedding company we do wedding photography and videography Wed flix check us out if you haven't on YouTube Instagram but we have been seriously impacted by this virus our business has been it has come to a screeching halt a screeching halt because weddings aren't happening right now how many weddings that we had canceled or postponed do you know I mean I would think around 15 or so I haven't counted but it's a lot yes I mean just to think for like two months 15 weddings that's a lot mm-hmm this has been a difficult time for us for sure basically all of our income or most of our income has stopped coming in and it's but we're really trusting God that he's gonna bring us through this whole thing and actually turn it into an amazing thing because he already is yeah which he already is which is why we love that verse so much Romans 8:28 you know it and I called according to his purpose yes so do you really believe that do you believe that God works all things for the good of those who love him and we believe that we believe that and we believe that's what he's gonna do with this whole situation and especially with our business and we're already seeing it we're already seeing things us being able work on things that we've never had the opportunity to before that's gonna tenfold our business when it's back in action so we're really excited about that it's also kind of nice to get a little break like before we have a baby and right before all this happened we were feeling very good morning before all this happened we were feeling very overwhelmed with things to do like especially him to do is just stressing me out and now not to do which is kind of nice except spend time with it each other which is also another way to turn this whole situation into a great positive is to it is bringing opportunities that we don't normally have such as being able to spend more quality time with the people that you love so take advantage of this time you know your it won't always be this way so you know really appreciate this time and make the most of it that we have with our families and our children and our loved ones you know really cherish this quality time together because it won't always be this way mm-hmm nothing fun that we've been doing even before all this started happening that we thought maybe you guys could do with us that is fun is to memorize Bible verses so we've been going down the alphabet we started with a and you do a verse that starts with the letter A and then so on all the way to Z we're on em right now and you've heard our first one Romans 8:28 be blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs theirs will be the kingdom of heaven let's see come to me all who are weary and burdened I will give you rest for my burden is light Matthew 11:30 yeah so that kind of gives you a little example of what we're talking about but yeah just going finding Bible verses that start with the letters abcdefg and just going down alphabet and it's really fun an amazing thing to do it's just so we say in every day we take turns like all say in one day and then he's listening me to the next day he'll say and so we're getting to hear them and say them every day which helps you remember them and then you know God says his word is our armor so we need to know it especially in this time yeah it's fun because I realize sometimes that I'm thinking like I'm doing it in my head my own like in the shower and just like setting the verses like what better things to fill your mind with that and especially when you're like watching sermons and you hear them like say the verse and you can say it along with them you feel so smart and we started we were like that we can't do this there's no way but we're on him and we got it guys so you can do it too mm-hmm yes all right well I think that wraps up this little life update and thank God that we are virus free as of now and we pray that you are too let's pray for each other and please pray for this little guy he comes in the right time because we don't want him coming in to crazy and that's a reminder to the pregnant women out there I want to hear what you guys are planning to do I want to see like what everyone else is doing apparently in Georgia the hospitals are supposed to reach maximum capacity in about two weeks so if we've ever considered a home birth it might be right now all right well that's it for now we will we got a beautiful day ahead of us you see that sky oh yeah that's how we spend our quarantine all right I'll see you guys later have a safe week keep away from people I don't want y'all near anyone all right love y'all see you see what's up guys Natan Sutton back with another video and today we are talking about the Bible verse challenge yes the best way that you can spend your Quarantine from our video last week we've mentioned this Bible verse challenge we've got a lot of comments of you guys really liking the ideas some messages of people wanting us to share the verses that we've done so that you guys can do it along with us so we were like hey what a great video idea and what a great way to spend your quarantine yes so this idea originated from a video that we saw online of this little boy how was he like five five years old and he was going through the alphabet so for every letter he had a Bible verse memorized and we were like that is so cool let's do that like if he can do it we can do it yeah and it's something that we want to teach our kids one day so today we're gonna kind of share with you what our morning routine looks like reading the Bible and met how we memorize these verses and we're gonna share with you our verses that we have memorized so far to give you a head start also I wanted to mention a why we're dressed up so fancy right now because we just if you guys have seen our video that we made it for Oakland for his birth video a maternity shoot kind of thing we're doing that now for baby number two and we don't even know if we're gonna be able to make the video because we can't leave our house but we want to do at least do the talking portion so you can have it so route forward on this we filmed that yes but anyway so every morning we wake up and we read the Bible together and we usually just kind of pick a book and we read through the entire way we read one chapter a day it's not very much but we read one chapter today and then so like I'll read and then she'll say the Bible verses and then the next day we flip she'll read and then I say the Bible verses and we usually add one Bible verse every week it doesn't sound like that much but it's I think it's a really good pace it's I think it's kind of slow for us but we need it that way some of you guys may be able to move way quicker and if you can that's awesome but for our memories that are about this big we wanted to challenge you guys especially during this time of quarantine it's a great opportunity to take on a new challenge a new passion and what better thing to memorize Bible verses I mean just think about it one Bible verse a week it doesn't sound like that much but years from now you will have hundreds of Bible verses in your back belt and it's just amazing to build your back pocket it's just amazing to be able to have that to pull out anytime you you need it you know it's like meditating on his promises and his commands it's just such a great thing so let's do it it's also nice to share Bible verses with people like sometimes I'll be talking to friends and in the past I will look up a verse like oh what's something about this but now I know it and I can just say it and I feel so cool what is it a hair about this long out of your ear you pick the weirdest times - this is what I have to live with this is why I need verses in my back pocket because it's to get me through this we're on the letter M currently we're halfway halfway through the alphabet and when we get to the end of the alphabet I think we'll probably just start over again so we have multiple alphabets worth of Bible all right so what we want to do is once we finish this because right now we say the verse and then we say where it came from in the Bible but when we're done we want to be able to like I asked him what's Philippians 4:6 and then he can say it like knowing it backwards - yeah and I think a little pro tip is get some flashcards I think flashcards is a great way to do this and I'd recommend doing it with a friend you could do it with a best friend or a family member or your spouse it's it's a great partner kind of exercise and that's a little competitive like when one of us gets it we're like yes I can do it we really want to see you guys do this so tag us on Instagram that Natan Sutton hashtag Bible verse challenge and we'd love to see you guys doing it so yeah we're gonna give you the ones that we've been doing you don't have to do these you can use your own but these guidelines I'm telling you yeah these are goals we try to choose the ones that are gonna be most relevant and we know they're good because we're constantly you know being caught up in church or like wow these must be some good verses I can put these in the description below too so you can go back and reference them alright go for it eight hey this is the one we did last week in the video so it is and we know God works all things for the good of those who love Him who are called according to his purpose Romans 8:28 be blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs will be the kingdom of heaven Matthew 5:10 see is come to me all who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest for my yoke is easy and my burden is light Matthew 11:28 and 30d is do not be anxious about anything but in everything through prayer and petition with Thanksgiving let your requests be known to God Philippians 4:6 that was a hard one that's one of my favorite I know I love that one he is every good and perfect gift is from above James 1:17 F for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life John 3:16 I thought I was missing something there it's kind of hard going back before I know we're used to just saying them you know by ourselves G is good we'll come to him who is generous and lends freely who conducts his affairs with justice Psalm 112 5 and a little tip here on memorizing the verses so we have noticed that Psalms are its salt and in the book of Psalm in the book of psalms I can never I always forget a good song so stuck on the it's not like when we get that rock yes so in the Book of Psalms I'll say that right now that it's always like reflecting on a promise or something and then we know that when Jesus is speaking it's in John that's been helpful or one of the Gospels yeah yeah yeah he was if gah he alone is my rock and my salvation he is my shelter am I getting in wrong he is my shelter I shall not be shaken Psalm 62 6 do I get it yeah I is I am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the Father except through me John 14:6 seal-like so there Jesus is speaking so you know it's either in Matthew Mark Luke or John Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 okay keep your lives free from the love of money and be satisfied with what you have where God said I will never leave you I would never forsake you oh oh yeah this one we even made a song out of to help us remember it let these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight Lord my rock and my Redeemer Psalm 19:14 I am last one M make every effort to live at peace with everyone and to be holy without holiness no one will see the Lord Hebrews 12:14 all right there ours is you don't have to use those but we really love those ones and feel free to share your verses down in the comments below we hope this Bible verse challenge really serves even does to your life what it's done to ours yes is I mean what better way to start the day reflecting on promises and his commands on how to live our life that's what I'm talking about alright guys that's a wrap close this outside lookin so pretty and her little maternity dress this is Nate and Sutton sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one puted time and that is the bible horse challenge that you should do every day that you're quarantined and for the rest of your life okay y'all can tell me what you guys think personally I would rather him have girlfriends then flings like yes he had one girlfriend and with her I'm like oh I bet she was so nice and like a good sweet girl cuz he spent a lot of time with her but all the other girls and there's a lot of them those I'm not happy about you didn't have to say all       what's up guys Natan setting back with another video and today what am i doing I'm doing the wrong intro what day is today alright we are back with another one it's been a minute since we've done a QA I know yesterday we were like why don't we do another Q&A so we asked you guys the questions on Instagram and if you don't follow us on Instagram go ahead and follow us because that's where we ask all of our questions to you guys so anyway we have told you guys to ask us things that we've never been asked for and we read a couple of them and y'all we're doing a really good job I know I think we've been hesitant to do a Q&A recently because we're like later we've already answered all the good questions they already asked us all but man you guys really don't really come up with the questions yeah y'all got some good ones coming don't just jump right into it mm-hmm no time to waste on the Q&A day all right well you ever wait to find out the gender of your baby until they're born never how could you I don't think I could do that because there's so much fun to me to pick the name decorate the room pick out the clothes like all that is so exciting and so fun and like imagining your life with this new baby that without knowing it's just like it's just takes away some excitement for me I know I feel like you're really milking the fun out of the whole experience because the gender-reveal is so much fun yeah you know and then when the baby gets here I feel like that's enough excitement is I don't need any more excitement when they get here so well it's just milking a little bit who initiates intimacy more definitely me which is kind of sad definitely nothing I think they used to maybe be heard of it I don't know I think that really right now it is him but it definitely have something to do with pregnancy I'm it messes with your hormones a lot you just don't feel that in the mood that often so lately it's been him but wait till I'm not pregnant anymore your day will come did you ever feel that before you were married that something would drift you apart oh I know what it was I know my answer is what that I thought that kind of what we were just talking about my fear was that she would not be as into intimacy as I am which I don't think it's normally that way but that was my biggest fear you know in trouble now yeah what do you look for in real friendships and how are you being good friends to your friends what I look for in a friend and what I think also is a good friend what I try to do is just being an intentional friend you don't have to hang out all the time or see each other all the time but like when I talk to my friends it's very intentional I'm like you know we spend a lot of time talking to each other whether it's texting on the phone and we see each other it's very intentional time not on our phones and then also I think remembering things about their lives like details about their lives that you can ask them about is a great example of being an intentional friend and it makes them feel like you're listening to them and you care about them yeah and another good little tip that I have found is I think something that bothers me personally is like if I'm texting somebody and they don't respond to me but I see them posting on social media that does happen to us a lot like let's just say I don't I don't think it's good friendship etiquette to do that yeah and we're not saying like you to respond like within the minute it could be ours it gave me days like what I have it doesn't really matter but when you're on social media we know you're on your phone just like what do you guys think about veganism we gotta open a can of worms on this one I they don't eat meat yeah our animal products is vegan so no milk or anything right veganism I was actually a vegan for a while I was raw vegan which is like the most extreme version of veganism where I literally nothing but fruits and vegetables or raw fruits and vegetables so it means you're allowed to have an opinion because you were one yes so no rice no beans nothing cut no bread only I would eat so much fruit it was like out of control my health I thought what started in deteriorating deteriorating deteriorating I felt like my health started deteriorating and I know that because I got my testosterone level tested after like six months of being vegan because I had suspicions that something weird was going on because my I had no longer had like interests in girls or anything just good for me because this was before me yeah and sure enough I got my testosterone levels tested and they were the equivalent of the average man in his 80s or 90s and it wasn't just me either as me and my two brothers we all did it together and we all had the same issue and then I ate a piece of fish and felt incredible do you plan on having more babies this close together no I mean we I definitely want to break between this one and our next one God willing we have another one but if we end up having four I'd be willing to do those close together but as far as like two then I want a little break yeah cranium for like two years tell us secrets from your childhood like those that are embarrassing oh guy who doesn't really feel like you have one oh yeah I have one so I was the youngest of three brothers I was the youngest of three brothers and I used to they used to think it was so funny when I would hurt myself and I was like my only way of getting them to like me I felt like was they like make them laugh and it's all to hurt myself purposely and I remember one thing I used to get my hands and just drill myself like over and over and over again later on set so much so that later on in life I was worried if I would be able to have kids that's horrible but yeah I used to do that and they thought it was so funny and that was like my way to get in with my older brothers friends how will you act when your son brings home a girlfriend I want to act like your parents reacted when I walked in like they acted like this I'm waiting for this moment the entire lives the meaning I felt so good when I walked into her parents house I was like wow this is awesome so like a movie star that's good I feel like I would it depends on his age I think like if he was young with a girlfriend I just don't think it wouldn't be a big fan of that and being young and bringing girls home but if he was older like when we started dating then I think I would be really excited to meet her and we've already been praying for her wherever she is out there we're praying for her so I think that she's gonna be great if you could go back in time and meet fifteen-year-old you what would you tell her 15 what was I doing at 15 I would say break up with your boyfriend enjoy your time with your friends and high schools waste of time that kind of leads to wanna know is a very commonly asked question which was the past relationships we didn't really want to talk about this because it's not our favorite subject but a lot of you was curious if we had past relationships before we met each other oh yeah yeah so I guess I'll go first I did have one relationship I had one relationship which I feel pretty good about but you shouldn't I mean I feel good that I like didn't have a ton of girlfriends it's worse why okay y'all can tell me what you guys think personally I would rather him have girlfriends then flings like yes he had one girlfriend and with her I'm like oh I bet she was so nice and like a good sweet girl cuz I spend a lot time with her but all the other girls and there's a lot of them those I'm not happy about you didn't have to say all this you trying to make yourself a hero my feelings yeah wife leaves I mean hookups are really portraying right now not hookups just little make-out sessions what do you wanna call it what do you want to call it that's what I know when people say hookups they think of like having sex okay Oh obviously not that they know that you didn't do that I had little infatuations no because that just means you had an interest that's not true I'll be honest with you guys for his answer and what I said was the truth okay well I did have I had one serious girlfriend that I was with her for five years in high school yeah in middle school I think we started in ninth grade and then through our first year of college geez and then after her I yeah I just dated around quite a bit I never had a serious girlfriend after that till seven that's a better way to put it yeah but see I would rather him have girlfriends than dating around because that involves like a lot of girls where like if he had a girlfriend of just him and that one girl which I would prefer that's not about your three serious relationships okay so important that they know I had three boyfriends one in high school that was about three and a half years one in college which was like a year I wouldn't say he was as serious he wasn't that serious and then another one later in college which was also just a year and I broke up with all of them yeah so obviously this is not a very fun topic to talk about between a married couple but we do recommend having this conversation one time and getting it all out on the table everything that you want to know just talk about it and be done with it forever that's what yeah that's some advice our marriage counselor gave us before we got married was you need to sit down and have the talk about your past like how many were fat yet what did you do like everything of everything that you want to tell tell it right then and then you just never bring it up again which I feel like is a great advice in here yeah yeah you guys made us do did y'all cuddle before marriage and do you advise against it we did and I do why why because it's dangerous territory we've covered this like a million times in our videos I saw someone comment on one of our recent videos they said do as I say and not as I did that we should say that yeah yeah that's funny I mean they were trying to stab at us but is funny comment how do you share Jesus with Oakland at this age and will you do the same baby number two well right now we pray for him and we sometimes pray with him out loud we take him to church with us and that's pretty much it for now but as he gets older you know we're gonna start reading them Bible stories and Christian music and things like that mm-hmm were we popular in school I was not popular at all until I became a swimming star for those of you that don't know I actually I won the state championship in my event in high school and swimming 50 freestyle and I actually set the state record and then I got a full ride to swim at the University of Georgia so once I became a athlete I became pretty popular but before that I was just hung out with the weird kids this the weird kids are the cool kids I like I was a weird kid for me I am the weird kid for me I was definitely not popular in middle school I young all the way up until like seventh grade definitely not and then I switched schools and I don't really know what happened like it was like I don't even know what happened but somehow you got it with the cool kids I don't know how what are some tips for anyone wanting to start a videography photography business this really pertains to any business that you're trying to start and that is just action you know I've been entrepreneur my whole life I've never worked for anyone else I've never had a real job and I think that's because I've understood that principle is action everyone has anyone can come up with a cool idea everyone has a million-dollar idea but it's those that take action on it that actually do something with it and it can be so fun to just sit around and think that oh this would be so cool if they did this but it doesn't really mean anything unless you do it so if you want to be and you know if you want to start your own business go do it it doesn't have to be perfect just go out and take action now is it okay to masturbate if you're married and think about your spouse do you think I should yeah it's a little inappropriate I bet people want to know that though I feel uncomfortable our family's watching that how old were you and you had your first kiss I think I was in the sixth grade a little baby how old are you I'm waiting here yeah I don't like these questions have you ever felt hopeless about your future when you were a teenager if so what did you do oh yeah for sure yeah that's a good one when I was a teenager there's many times like so often that I would think all I'm never gonna make money I'm never gonna find a wife money and wife was big to for me and there was a lot of times I felt hopeless but I just kept telling myself like God has provided for me up to this point in my life like everything I needed God has provided and I just kept telling my myself that it was always the future I was worried about it seemed like the present was never really an issue so I think that is a good reminder how do you deal with gossiping and staying out of it that's a good one for girls I feel like a lot of gossip happens and then you sometimes you don't even notice that it's starting to happen but it just starts happening but I think one thing is when people are gossiping to you you to see their act not interested and they'll stop doing it I've done that before like someone gossiping about someone to me and I just didn't really have a response or like anything to say and then I think they got the vibe of like oh like maybe I shouldn't have said that or but you know what they say if people are gossiping to you they probably just something about you what is one bad habit of your spouse Tooting at night in the bed oh my put it in all right let's see one more one more question come on don't look okay what's your how are you staying fit healthy during quarantine okay fit and healthy how you staying fit and healthy son eating pans of brownies oh my goodness something's kind of on a different program she's on the pregnancy program hi I have a pair of gymnastic rings and I love gymnastic rings the amount of workouts you can do with a pair of rings is incredible I've told him that he should make a workout video for you guys so if you want to see that tell us yeah it should be a great idea I always feel like the majority of our audience is females and yeah really want to see me working out no girls can work out too I mean they can do these workouts too yeah well if y'all want to see it let me know yeah maybe I will alright guys well that was fun thank you for the fun questions and it was it's been so cool to see everyone doing the Bible verse challenge yeah there's so many of you guys doing it in your code Oh put some great verses and if you haven't seen that challenge watch our previous video and do the challenge and tag us on Instagram and let us see here verses so every we decided that every Monday we're gonna share the one that we did so tomorrow we're gonna be sharing the letter B until you are verse and then you can also share your verses or you can do it with us we check whatever you want to do this is why I married a this is Natan Sutton sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time that was another QA what's up guys today I have a not so fun one for you you know we try to make our videos as uplifting and fun and attractive as possible but the truth is is that we love you we care for you and with love comes truth and truth is not always fun to hear we are not going to hold back for the fear of scaring people away or for upholding a certain image our purpose behind this channel is not only to sow seeds of inspiration but also the sow seeds of truth and love you know we try to read this book every day we want to understand what it says we don't want to count on what others have to say about it we want to hear what God says and there are some passages in this book that are very very concerning when we read the words of Jesus one of our biggest fears in this life is that even though there are many of you watching this video that would call yourselves Christians you may go to church every Sunday you may be able to quote scripture at left and right the thought that is deeply troubling to our hearts is that even though you may have done some or all of these things our fear is that some of you watching this people we truly care about even some of our own family members we worry that some of you might go to hell to be tormented day and night for all of eternity and that by the time you figure it out it'll be too late because Jesus actually tells us that this very thing will happen when he says many will say to me on that day Lord Lord did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles and then he says then I will tell them plainly I never knew you away from me you evildoers so just think for a minute what that is saying Jesus is saying that there will be people who prophesied in his name drove out demons in his name and even performed a miracles in his name but he net knew them that is just wild to think about because obviously he's speaking about people who are doing many great works in his name but he never even knew them one of the worst imaginable tragedies that I could possibly think of is the idea of people thinking they are saved and that they are going to heaven and they're actually not and it's not fun to talk about but most importantly it's not loving to not talk about it and fear that we will offend people and let them figure it out on their own at the end when it's too late but another fear of ours is that we don't want people who actually know Jesus to feel like they don't and to be worried about it our hope and prayer for this video is not to have everyone will read about their salvation but also we don't want everyone assuming they're saved when they might not be this is our deepest care for all of you that you truly know God we are all going to stand before him one day and he's going to say one of two things well done good and faithful servant or depart from me I never knew you it's so easy to toss this to the side and become so consumed with the cares of this world but what could be more important this we hear heartbreaking stories and messages from you guys all the time stories like finding out your partner has been cheating on you and that's horrible and we feel for you but not as much as we care about your salvation some of you are struggling with poor health or losing your job and we care deeply about that but not as much as we care about this there's many bad things that we all deal with and we hear about and we are here for you for that but they are nothing in comparison to this because this is forever we are all going to stand before God one day and he's going to say one of two things and your eternity depends on it nobody likes talking about health so much so I mean when's the last time you heard your pastor speak about Hell in church people don't want to talk about it because it's a turn-off but we can't pretend like it doesn't exist and that people aren't going there the world teaches us how can a loving God punish how could a loving God torture that's what's popular in our world today but we don't here to teach what's popular we are here to teach what's biblical read the Bible for yourselves start in Genesis you'll read about a time where God drowned everyone on the planet he was grieved that he made them you'll read about where God told the Egyptians if you don't let my people go I will kill the firstborn of every household now I'm not saying he's not a loving God what I'm saying is that there's other parts of him he's a God of justice and a god of wrath read this book for yourself and I can hear a lot of you saying well that was in Genesis that's the way it used to be well flip for words revelation read about how it all ends and you will see that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and that the fear of the Lord truly is the beginning of wisdom we want to be clear here that God is a God of love he's a God of redemption in a God that wants to save that's why he sent his son but nowhere in this book will you see people praying a prayer and being good to go it was all about repenting and becoming a new creation you have to be born again you have to die to yourself and that's our question to you today have you surrendered your life to Jesus or did you simply say a prayer one day in hopes that it will get you into heaven we believe that we are all saved by faith alone and not by works but the question is do you really have faith James 2:17 says that without works your faith is dead and then goes on to say that even the demons believe think about that Wow what does that mean it means that you have deceived yourself if you say you have faith in Jesus but your life does not reflect that you have no fruit and you probably don't actually believe the life you live is evidence as to whether you truly believe or not we never want you to hear the words out of our creator's mouth that he never knew you what could be worse than that there's nothing more important than your eternity are you truly following Jesus are you obeying his commands are you a new creation our prayer for this video is that it's your wake-up call and that you will truly come to know our God and that he truly knows you you happy Anniversary darling can you believe it's been four years four years ago God gave me the greatest blessing that blessing was you my wife little did I know on our first date the moment I saw you walking towards me you would be my forever life partner the last four years have been the greatest years of my life thinking back to our first handhold all the way to almost delivering our second baby now I thank God for every second in between and wouldn't want a thing to be any different quickly after meeting you we began exploring the world together and I quickly saw how great you were for me there truly was fireworks then and even now there's nothing that can bring me to tears quicker than the thought of not   you truly are a gem son there's no one like you I want you to know that all the sacrifices you made growing up all the things you said no to and all the things you said yes to was so worth it standing out from the crowd may have not always been the easy decision but it was what led us together it formed you into the girl I asked to be my wife the mother of our children and the one I fall in love with every single day   and I know many years from now our children will say the same thing to you I can hear their words now thank you mom thank you for playing with me instead of looking at your phone thank you for making me laugh so hard I cried thank you for putting in the effort of teaching me what's right versus wrong and giving me an example of a life following Jesus thank you for loving daddy so well and showing us what a loving marriage looks like   you'll never know the depths of my love for you all I can do is hope that I can give you a glimpse specially every day what you mean to me all the worry all the doubts all the fear I had of never finding someone to spend my life with it was so worth it because it made finding you that much sweeter from starting a business to building a family to creating a legacy it's more than I could ever ask for as a husband I'm blessed beyond words and like my Mima always said if I grumble I deserve a whoopin so what now I don't know what the future holds but if it's anything like these past four years I can't wait to see what God has in store he's been so good to us and let's never forget it I love you darlin I fell my heart your husband Nathaniel it's our anniversary and this is how I pick out my woman some roses check out that bouquet the anniversary babe yes pretty we got to put it in a vase it's slavery vlog is what it is wait food world part one here we go we are headed to the hospital hopefully with good reason I've been I've taught my contractions every night for a week now because I've been having prodromal labor which is like basically your body is going into labor every night and then it's like oh there so anyway tonight I've been timing them averaging five minutes for two hours now and we have an hour drive to the hospital so I might as well just go because I'm scared yeah because what you guys know about Sutton's last pregnancy she when her water broke things got real real serious fast meaning she was in excruciating pain and we were right next to the hospital and she felt like she could probably make it that long so now we have an hour drive so the goal is to get to the hospital before a sudden starts break in the waters if that happens we probably not gonna update you again it was kind of sad leaving oke but hey this is our first time away we always got one night away from him ever so this is like really our first time all right we'll keep y'all posted we're drivin the hospital I'll see what they say sadi how you feelin look at it laughs I mean look at it moved by your jiggle look at it jiggle by you ass you ready why is it not recording oh we're on hello people we're using on a fancy dancy a new camera tripod or iPhone tripod fancy dancy anyway we're back home and as you can see still cooking he's still in there what are you doing sudden I'm 39 weeks today and today's been the first time in a week that I have not been having contractions all day long and it's been very nice so we went to the hospital last night and Sutton was just crying wolf not me turns out she's in what they call prodromal wave yeah by the attractions were five minutes apart or less for two hours which is what they told us if that happens for an hour to come in so we did but I was only one centimeter dilated which I was one centimeter valid in two weeks and she's been having contractions for weeks but what we learned and what they told us is that it doesn't really matter that much if they're not painful but that's not that's that's not the case for everyone because I was trying to get Oakland in there but anyway that's not the case for everyone but they said that for her she shouldn't really be until I get painful which is what I've been scared to do because the doctor's office is an hour away so that's why I've been timed it was like trying to catch it early so we can't get there before like any real pain testing but now I've decided I'm not even going to time them unless they're free because I'm sick yeah so I thought maybe oh speaking of so when she really goes in labor are you going anyway so sentence buñol you've been through kind of a hard time lately haven't you yes an emotional roller coaster it's like physically mentally and emotionally exhausting because every day that I had these few charges on okay today's the day I'm like I feel like I'm preparing myself mentally and physically and then nothing eyes lose sleep over it like contractions keep me awake half the night but today I got her a maternity massage early Mother's Day present how was that that was yes she got to lay on her stomach for the first time and how long they had this fancy they had the fancy little pregnancy table where her stomach had laid flat through the bowl I also forgot to mention that we're officially more pregnant than I was with Oakland so if I was having Tamara would have happened yesterday so now that we're 39 weeks we're officially past which I think was the thing I thought your psychic K comes faster but you should give him a bump update show him how you get off the ground no that's too bearson but we'll show you because it's ridiculous Wow look at that you know the wide-angle lens doesn't do much to help ya she's all stomach that that's like what pregnant women dream of looking like so anyway also alarm on the delivery but maybe next time hopefully next time I go to hospital it better he'd better be coming next sent right okay you want your brother don't you give up my kids he's gonna be good big brother you're gonna kiss honey to tubes you're gonna kiss i bleeped it out i just said his name but i bleeped it out okay what's your brother's name okay tell him what your brother's name is what's your brother's name you guys got to see how oakland can throw the ball he's got a real arm on him okay look throw the ball the ball here it's right here okay give me one of kids yes alright guys so tonight could be the night sudden just woke me up shortly after we went to sleep having some serious stomach pain and so we called the Midwife she told us for her to take a bath and see if that alleviates some of the pain and the contractions and they've been painful and consistent and it wouldn't surprise me if we go to the hospital tonight okay we're almost inside almost there you're not able to walk through it yeah she's having some painful ones not yet oh boy oh boy     how long does it take to get an epidural pass is there any way anyway that's like there's no way to get it in a few minutes       like excellent sit we afraid of that pressure         the hardest part                 it's someone Amin epidural is crazy   you what's up guys Natan Sutton back with a really quick video today first off we just wanted to thank you all for your amazing comments and support and encouragement from a birth blog y'all are the best that was a very intense experience and we're grateful that we were able to share a little bit about that with all of you guys yes and this Sunday's video will be Oakland meeting halston for the first time so be sure to check that out it's gonna be mighty sweet so as you can see from the title over the next 30 days we're putting a small group together about 10 to 20 people and we're gonna be going through a 30 day cleanse transformation together we posted about this on Instagram and already got an amazing response but for those of you that missed it we wanted to give you a chance to join to since we got so many requests from you guys to do a workout video as we were preparing to make one this idea hit us and we are super excited about it we're so gonna do the workout video it's specifically targeted towards people who want to lose weight they're struggling with health challenges or they just want to start living a healthier lifestyle and with all of this virus stuff going on there's never been a more important time to take care of our bodies and build our immune systems so we thought how cool would it be to do a 30 day cleanse that we will personally walk you through to really supercharge our health together we're gonna create a private Facebook group for everyone who joins where we'll be able to interact and support each other it's also a place where Nathaniel and I will post daily videos so motivate and encourage you it will be an amazing opportunity for us to connect with some of you guys and also just give you all a chance to connect with people of similar interests and goals so what does the cleanse look like and who's it for the cleanse comes from a company that we love and has worked so well for many many other people they have the highest quality health products I've personally ever come across and it's going to be like a vacation from over-processed genetically modified food and flooding your body with nutrient-dense low calorie superfoods breaking the addictions to sugar salt carbs and Kim these super foods are going to nourish your body with nutrients while cleansing your body of harmful chemicals and toxins so what it entails is basically replacing one to two meals a day with superfoods and shakes along with that we are going to walk you through other health hacks that will help you transform your health as quickly as possible and develop new habits so once the transformation is over you will continue to maintain your weight loss and your health goals just as an FYI we're not charging anything for this all you have to do is purchase the cleanse from the company that provides it which we're going to connect you with and it includes your super foods and shakes and we're there to help guide you the whole way through yes and the cool thing is everyone will be going through the cleanse at the exact same time from day one through day 30 so you're not at it alone and the company gives you a schedule that tells you exactly what to take and when to take it so if this interests you email us at Nate and Sutton at gmail.com with the subject transformation and tell us why you think you'd be a good fit for the group we are probably going to start the transformation within the next week or

embarrassing moment and not many people can say that they shared it with thousands of people but me our baby's name is Halston Luke it's so funny because one of the videos we made in the Phaedo set it and you guys lip read it I know he's trying to say hey to you guys making his debut on the channel but anyway yeah so if you go back a couple videos I said it and bleeped it out and some and I was like no way anyone's gonna guess that and cents like people can lip read and I'm like no way anyone's gonna get that somebody got and I deleted your stinking comment I think it was more than one person got it I know how to delete oh good so where did you get the name Halston um so random just like Oakland I was looking online for just ideas just like how to spark something and I saw online the name also Alston like just without the age well that's kind of cool but it sounds a little bit too much like Austin and the kind of hard to understand I was like I feel like it's missing something so then we put an H in front of it and it goes well with Oakland Oakland Alston said now you can get our theme that we're going for with our kids names and Luke is my great-grandfather's name so we have Oakland James and James came from him and Luke came from my great-grandfather they're both Bible names which would also like what are you doing that is called the windmill mom's on call told me

videos nowadays because all right much time you're at least for now until we get the hang of things having these two little guys running around we did a story time of Oakland's birth like way after we had him so everything was so such a blur but I'm glad we're doing this so close to when I had Halston because I remember it all right so let's hop into let's see what people are asking you you all submitted so many questions I was like I don't think we're gonna get like that many questions for this kind of video and if they'll ask me last night he's like so how are the questions looking and it was like like you couldn't even I don't even know how many there are you so many oh man all right let's get started here would you choose one over the other yes so just as a quick little I'm not sure how obvious this is gonna be but we're interviewing Sutton on the difference between having a natural birth versus a birth with an epidural because she has done both not many people have not by choice they came upon me yeah so you would choose one over the other yes I would choose the epidural and first of all before we even start this video let's just get this out there that everyone's experience is different everyone's pain level is different I don't want you guys yeah I don't want you guys watching our video I've been like oh I'm scared to ever have kids I don't want to go through that because just because I had this horrific pain does not at all mean that's what's gonna happen to you our doctor told us that the faster labor comes on the more painful it is and I had the entire experience within an hour and when we got the hospital by water I mean I had him within 15 minutes of being the hospital so that's like on the fast track if I've ever heard it so I think the pain I was experiencing was like a different level of pain my friend has had natural birth and she said it was just like an out kind of pain but that was not my experience as you can hear yeah from our previous video so I would choose yeah change the question I would choose an epidural and I have reasons I'll tell you the main the main reason is because so without the pain I felt like I was able to be more present it was just a more enjoyable experience like I wasn't in this horrific pain and that's all I could think about like with Hostin all I could think about was how bad this hurts and like some of the questions I saw was who are saying when they lay him on your chest as the pain go away and for me no it did not like all I was still thinking about was like how bad I'm hurting and I couldn't enjoy like looking at him because I couldn't think about anything else yeah and as a husband I prefer the epidural as well although yeah my experience overall but I will say I'm not being interviewed number one what do you believe God revealed to you during the process of natural birth it was a very quick process but I would say probably the biggest thing now is revealed to me is that I could do it like I always even in the video I'm saying I can't do it I can't do it and before ever having him I was said like I can't not have an epidural so I guess I you showed me that yes I can do it yes it fun no but you can do it that's one thing I was telling Sutton as I think that she underestimates herself a lot and I felt like this was a great opportunity to show that she's capable of more than she thinks well your next birthing experience be natural or will you get an epidural I'm getting a girl and I'm camping out in the hospital parking lot to be there on time because for those of you that don't know that's the whole reason she kind have an epidural is because we got there too late and within 15 minutes of us getting there and Halston came out so but it was not too late on our fault like it's not like we were lollygagging around everyone told me from the beginning don't come to the hospital until your contractions hurt so we were going off of that cuz y'all saw everybody ever the false alarm those contractions didn't hurt so I was like okay well then we'll just wait till they do and so I had two contractions that hurt and we walked out the door and got in the car it's like we could not have gotten there any faster I don't think someone asked what how bad does the epidural hurt oh it doesn't hurt at all like I feel like you're already well at least for me with Oakland I was already in pain like from the contractions that when they're giving you the epidural it's like you know this thing is about to give you such relief that you're just like do it just do whatever you want I don't care and I don't even I mean yeah it's you don't even feel it it's just like relief is coming compared the recovery oh this was a very common question that I think was a good one okay first of all with Oakland I had y'all if you've been watching us for a while you know that I had like really bad back pain and really bad tailbone pain before having him like when I was pregnant I had that pain and a lot of people say like oh the epidural causes back pain I don't know that to be true because my back was already hurting like so bad that I'm not gonna blame the epidural for my back pain so I will say the recovery this time around was a lot better but with Halston's pregnancy I didn't have to I'm fading I didn't have back pain during my pregnancy I was doing physical therapy so it makes it sound like the epidural may have done it but I don't believe that it did because I those things were already hurting and also with Oakland I had the tailbone and back pain in the beds in the hospital are so uncomfortable and when I got the epidural I couldn't feel all the pain I was having and I even told him I was like man this is so nice like I'm sitting up can you believe I'm sitting up this feels so good and then afterwards boy did I feel the fact that I've been sick without feeling it so this time the recovery has been better but I'm not gonna put the blame on the epidural for my recovery being harder the first time because I just don't know that to be true can you try to describe the pain you went through oh I mean there's really not words like I don't know that there's something that would hurt worse than that to me how has being a family of four affected your marriage and relationship with Nate I had to throw myself in there it's right there Lorelai two weeks in and I just feel like this time is very consuming with a baby one of his friends actually gave him that advice before we had Oakland he's like be prepared that she is gonna be all about the baby and not about you like you just gotta suck it up and be supportive and I play that's kind of happening again like it's just so demanding that you really sadly we don't have much time together but it's just a short amount of time like it's gonna be over before you know it right we'll see Oh someone asked a question I saw earlier that I don't know if you're gonna find it so I'm gonna answer it they asked if did I tear the first time and the second time and could I feel it so the answer is yes tore both times first-degree tear which is supposedly like the best kind that you can have like not so bad and yes you could feel it felt it happen do you feel empowered by your body or traumatized by the pain or somewhere in between um I definitely feel good about it like I I you know I kind of did something that I never thought I could do and never wanted to do and I did it so that feels good I don't feel traumatized like it's not like I'm like thinking back on it like oh that was so horrible which one seems more emotional when it comes to the memory of those moments I know your answer yeah for me this was so much more emotional than with Auckland I remember I don't even know if I cried with Oakland maybe a little bit but this one I was just like a mess because I I think it was directly correlated with javea pain she was experiencing to see her in that much pain just took me to over the edge oh yeah I would say the same thing it was definitely more emotional but Oakland's it was just a weird scenario of like we were sleeping kind of and they come in the barge in the doors like all right let's go ten foot yeah it was just weird but with this one there was like so much build-up to it I had been awake for so long like in the middle of the night and yeah this one was more emotional what was the reason the nurses and doctors gave for not enabling an epidural oh they said it's too late what they said yeah she said she said it would be like any minute now X I think I was like 9 and 3/4 dilated or something and she actually it missed this part in the video but she was like I'm gonna go get the test for the virus or whatever she leaves the room and like literally within a minute I was telling him I was like he's coming out right now like get her to come back in here and so he stuck is how the door was like yelling like someone coming here we're in the triage room like the room that you go to when you first get to the hospital we weren't even in like a hospital room like where you have a baby yeah I was confused yeah I think she was a little confused she acted like she's like it's coming up throw up yeah my gonna throw up okay let me get I was running to get a trash can and she's like nobody's coming out but it is now oh yeah basically and I think they said that the epidural would have taken like 30 minutes for you to even feel it right something like yeah any of they get tested to do it like test your bladders I'm not sure but anyway they basically met it made it sound like she just didn't have time hi I was wondering why is the belly still big even after birth oh my gosh his brother said this to me after out Ugland he came in the hospital room the next day and he's like why he's still pregnant it they're babies right here I always thought that was weird too I thought your son because it was like flat right after you give birth no you I mean you have so much water way to lose and everything and all your organs gotta move back in place and it just takes time I've heard people say that it takes you nine months to get that way like to get that pregnant so give yourself nine months to get back what I think is very fair how did you feel seeing that Daniel worried crying for you I have to put myself in here somehow I'll tell you in the moment I didn't even notice I didn't know he was filming I didn't I feel like I didn't hear anything like whatever the nurse was something to do I didn't know he was crying no I feel like I had my eyes closed like the majority of the time but I just I couldn't listen to anything like it was just so crazy but watching the video back maybe I definitely cried watching our video probably more for him than me and someone else asked I thought this is a good question did the did they numb me to sell me up and they did they put something in my arm that was supposed to make me feel like I had a couple alcoholic drinks they said and they did it once and I didn't feel anything and she's like starting to give me the numbing shots there and I was like just so you know I don't feel dizzy or anything and so they gave me like another thing in my arm and then she was giving me the shots and honestly they could have literally had done anything to me and I'm like it it does not hurt like you can do whatever you want doesn't hurt because nothing compared to the pain I just had it's like getting the shots no big deal sewn up no big deal needles in my arm didn't care there's the star of the show we had to take a little haul see break he was crying he needed someone to come rescue him from his net so hey you going for old and then bad you better hold him right wait you think that's bad yeah he likes a little stretch okay it seemed to be a common question of feeling like drugged with the epidural and I'll tell you that you don't feel bad like I felt numb from the waist down but I didn't feel like dizzy or anything going on in my head that's the Holston question who's the cutest guy in the world this is his first couch video debut he likes mine how do you feel how do you feel about so if you'll sing your lady bits lady bits that's definitely a weird thing for some reason it's not that weird having the baby because you have so much other things going on but all the appointments before that doing those things it's not very fun did you have a Midwife deliver or a doctor it was a midwife did you keep your placenta or take a photo no but she didn't show it to us and it was huge that was something that I really liked how this hospital was she was it was so nice that they were informing us on what the heck was going on like at the with oaklands experience I didn't know what was who I don't like what they were doing but she was so nice and she would like tell us okay his cord has done pumping all the blood like this is the color it turns when it's done and now we can cut it she let him cut it and then she was showing us the placenta and like pulled it out and showed us like the anatomy of it she said she was trying to get Halston out while he was still in the water sac yeah I know that was a thing I thought your water had to break before you like have your baby but yes so he was coming he was about to come out in his water and then it bursts in the last second and went everywhere a common question also is do we try any different positions or did they suggest anything but I don't know if the video shows it right but there was like no time for anything there was no time to talk there was no time to move it was just like you're in the bed she leaves to go get the Cova 19 tests and then within a minute we're like yelling her to come back in there and she's like putting on her masking her gown and stuff and he was out like it was just there was no time to try anything else alright guys well it's time for a little Halston to eat but you heard it from here first and once again I'll put a disclaimer at the end to everyone's pain is different everyone's experience is different don't take my experience to be yours it will be different so don't be scared but in the meantime also we're probably gonna create a new intro video and I'm trying to think would you guys rather see like random fun clips of our lives like we kind of have in our current intro or would you like to see like and like how do I say like a one location shoot if that makes sense I know my vote what the first one oh really why it's just martini is fun like you see different stuff and then all the same stuff yeah alright let's close it out Halston this is Nate this is Nate and Sutton and Halston sowing seeds of truth loving babies one view at a time yeah and that was a natural birth cue a all right okay here we go what's up guys what's up guys what's up guys Nate incenting back with another video and today we are talking about something very fascinating what are we talking about so it's special we're talking about this idea that his cousin actually introduced us to she came over here and was telling us about it and we decided we were gonna try it and we did and we liked it and we wanted to tell y'all about it yeah so this could be like the biggest news ever if this is the real deal and that's what we are exploring and we want to explore it with you guys because you know why not yeah so we've only been doing this like is it three days something like so it's really new to us like we're so to get the hang of it but anyways well so what it is yeah well first off before we tell them what it is you know I kind of in the back of my mind I was thinking like I'm gonna do this for a really long time and then if I think it's the real deal then we'll share it but I thought why not just go ahead and share it with our audience now so that we can kind of experience it together and get feedback off of one another but anyway so the idea is talking to God and not like praying to him but also listening like reciept like a two-way conversation like hearing his voice that's what it's called it's called two-way journaling so it's like you're you write what you have to say if you have anything to say and then you just be still and listen yeah so my cousin if you came over to our house the other day   my cousin came over to our house the other day and she pulled out this journal and she started like reading it to us and she's like I really wanted to share with you guys what God has been telling me recently and I'm looking okay yeah let's hear it and then she was reading it as though like God was really like speaking in the first person like talking to her like she was hearing his voice and I was just thinking I'm like is this for real I mean if she can experience this I wouldn't know I want some of that she's been doing it for years she says she has like journals and journals filled up at her house yeah for like eight years she's been doing this so she introduced us to this guy named Mark Berkley he pretty much has this four step process on how to hear God's voice and it's all biblical so step number one is be still and get quiet be still get quiet in a place with God where you're not thinking about what you have to do things places you have to go but really just sitting and quiet being still and knowing that he is God step number two is seeking Jesus so you're sitting there in the quiet and you just fix your eyes on Jesus and think about him and just listen yeah what I've been doing is I like literally picture his face like him there with me and then step number three is listen to spontaneous thoughts so not thoughts that you are coming up with on your own thoughts that you feel like they just kind of came out of thin air step number four is writing it down so as you're listening and the thoughts are coming to you you just start writing down what you're hearing don't think about it just write it down and you can read back through it later to see what it says yeah and so the whole idea here is to not judge your the thoughts that you feel like you're getting right away or the what you feel like God is telling you you just write it all down and then later you can go back and kind of discern okay was this my thought or was this God telling me this and what I have found is that I've been writing some things down that I I would never have came up with on my own and I'm thinking like wow this is like really God talking to me what's interesting about his he read me his first one and also his cousin is that they're hearing things in like a way that they wouldn't speak in things that they wouldn't say and I know that his cousin even said that she heard this word that she didn't know what it meant and she like I had to look it up like what does this word even mean yeah and one way that I have found to make it flow where it seems like it was just coming in a lot easier is by asking questions so whatever the question may be like I've been starting it off usually by saying by asking God like what do you want to tell me today what do you want to say to me right now or how can I improve in this area in my life are is am i living in a way is there an area in my life that you want to clean up reveal to me how you want me to change things that I'm doing and all of a sudden you ask these questions and you seek your eyes on Jesus and then it just seems like you start receiving yeah we were on a walk the other day and you just tell me that he's like questioning is it real even though I feel like when I heard his no I feel like when I heard his first experience my eyes water like I literally feel like I was listening to God talking but he's like oh you're still question like is it realer than my thoughts I don't know but I told the first verse that came to my mind was those who seek will find and if you're sitting there in the silence and you're seeking God and you're seeking Jesus he is going to speak to you yeah and you know Jesus said my sheep will hear my voice so this is your opportunity to try to seek his voice and this is not something that I would normally do but I thought for the sake of us learning together and experiencing this together that I would share some of my first journal entry with you guys just to give you an idea he's typing he's also so if you're not big on writing which he's not you could just type it which is a lot faster probably easier yeah so this is the first time that i journaled this is what i heard you're nervous to meet with me because you're afraid of what i could do in your life because but I may ask you to let go of and the things I want you to take hold of I want you to spend more time with me and less on yourself you're not ready to hear what I want you to give up I want to also give you something beyond your wildest dreams but you're not ready for that either just be patient continue to seek me and it will come be still and know that I am God seek Jesus if you want to hear my voice continue to come meet with me I want you to know that I love you like your like you love your sons multiplied by the stars in the universe and then I asked them is this really you speaking to me God or my own words and he said you are here but I am he these words are not your own nothing you do is of your own and then I said how do I know for certain that these words are yours and then he said listen and apply and watch the fruit take place in your life my good fruit will be the evidence of what you're looking for that was a little bit of my first experience and you know that was my biggest question like how do I know that this is for real like how do I know this is God talking to me and that's what he told me is that continue to meet with him put him first seek him and be in his presence and then the good fruit from that will show up in my life and that will be the evidence that I'm looking for yeah I'm really excited about this idea because my in my relationship with God I have felt like something is missing like we read the Bible together we pray we are doing the Bible verse challenge we were memorizing all these verses but something just felt like it was missing and so I'm really excited about this idea because it's such a two-way street and it's just intentional time with God and it lets you it just opened your mind to listening to him and then I also really like the idea of writing it down because one day you can look back on all these things that God said to you yeah yeah and yesterday before my meeting with God it sounds funny saying I was I was starting to think like you know maybe even a little pressure on myself that oh I need to hear as much as I did yesterday or maybe even more and write that down and then God told me that it's not about how much he says to me it's all about meeting with him and seeking Him and having that intimate quiet time with him and that should be like the number one priority is like desiring to be with God and having that intimacy and then the rest will come whether that's no I'm saying a thousand words to you or are you just sitting in his presence so yeah that's pretty much it we just wanted to make this quick video experiencing this with you guys together and getting y'all's feedback so I would love for this next week for those of you that are interested to try this out you know I've been going in a closet you can do go wherever you want but just get somewhere really quiet pull out your phone or journal get ready to write down spontaneous thoughts that you hear thoughts that just seem to pop up and try not to judge them too much just just write them down and then go back and read them and if they're encouraging if they're loving if they fill you with peace if they fill you with joy then maybe it's a good sign that they were coming from God and in the description below we're gonna link these videos that we're referring to by mark burglar who just explains really quickly like how to do this yeah he explains basically the four steps that he has found to help people hear God's voice oh and the interviewer is asking him if things keep coming up in your mind like I know we all feel like we have a lot of things to do you start thinking of all these things you have to do that you just write them down just to get them out of your head like they're right there so you'll remember them and then just move on to the next thing like I feel like she was really pushing him on well what if this happens and what if this happen so they're giving you like different scenarios and how to like push through and really experience this time with God yeah so be sure to check out the videos in one other tip that I'll leave you with is really to get honest and transparent with yourself and with God what you're experiencing in that moment so like if you're having a million thoughts raced through your mind that you feel like you came and focus on him tell him that Ryden write it down and be like God what do you want me to do with this how do I this out of my life how do I focus more on you whatever it is you know just really get present with yourself your thoughts your feelings and let God know what it is whether it's positive or negative he's there he already knows so just be transparent with them and receive his voice and its presence it's also really cool about this is that it's biblical you know a lot of the writings in the Bible are written in this fashion where it's like a two-way street where the author is asking God questions writing to him and then he receives back so that's one aspect of it that I really liked all right guys thanks for watching the video we're really excited for y'all to try this and we're excited to hear about your experience and how it's been for you so that was Nate and Sutton sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one buta time that was Natan Sutton this his Nathan said this is Nathan sighs so he's truth love and inspiration one day at a time and that was how to hear God's voice I felt for some reason my whole life that I would have two boys first I don't know why and that was like God gave that to me I don't know but I always thought that I would have two boys and so now it feels like God's promise is just being brought to fruition yeah it's crazy I've been having this image in my mind recently you have two little boys running around here and I'm so excited ha ha can't believe I'm filming about this but I don't take a pregnancy test I'm nervous I think if it is positive but they know it's gonna be like shocked   if I could hope that you do one thing in your life it would be to make a difference in God's kingdom I think that's whole reason we're even here on earth is to do that so if I could watch you and Auckland do that throughout your lives that would be an answered prayer I pray that for you every single day   this   what do you know are you jerking me around another maybe are you kidding me all right baby Halston I am so excited to meet you I can't wait to just hold you and see what you look like and see what kind of personality that you have the kind of man that you grow up to be so blessed and thankful to be able to be your dad and to show you life and to experience life by your side and just know that I will always be here for you I will always be your best friend I love you so much and don't you ever forget it I already love you so much an item since we've had Oakland I know that feeling of having a baby at seeing them for the first time and getting to meet them it's just so exciting and so special and I'm so excited to have that with you and to hold you for the first time to see you the little boy that I've been praying for that I've been riding to I'm gonna be able to put a face I just can't wait to get to know you and love you from the recipe     you what's up guys Natan Sutton back with another video and what are we doing in the kitchen we're talking about a clothes so for those of you guys that remember about a month ago we posted a video inviting you to join us on a 30 day transformation well we are two weeks into that transformation and things are getting crazy it ended up being about forty people joining us for this 30 days and the results have truly been remarkable I mean absolutely crazy so we got to do it again like we have no choice so we are doing another 30 day transformation starting on July 1st that we are inviting YouTube in case you missed out on the first one you don't want to miss out on this because it's awesome it's awesome and we're gonna read you guys some of the testimonies that we've been getting in so far and while she does that I'm actually gonna show you exactly what the cleanse is last time we didn't really get into detail about what it was but I'm going to show you exactly what it is is just a quick reminder who this cleanse is for this cleanse is for anyone trying to lose weight struggling with health challenges or just trying to get their energy back regain their health get as healthy as possible that's who this cleanse is for and for those of you that join we are gonna be adding you to our private Facebook group where we will all be going through the 30 day cleanse together from day one to day 30 we're gonna be good doing it together but something really fun in the first group because everyone is just like encouraging each other and helping each other like if you have issues the other people are saying like well this work for me you should try this it has been so fun like having a community and just getting to know you guys like we're always in front of the camera so yeah I think y'all know us but we haven't had the opportunity to get to know you so being in the group with you guys like watching videos and responding to people has been really fun yeah I don't know if you've ever tried to do like a challenge or a transformation on your own before but if you failed it's probably because you didn't have a support group having that support and community is just everything so while I'm gonna get this cleanse I'm gonna show you exactly what the cleanse is she's gonna start reading some of the testimonials that we've been getting in just from the first week or two these are like from week one to week two okay so Tito someone in the group he's a youth pastor and was trying to get in shape for his students so he says y'all I'm so excited on how much this is slowly changing my body and I can't wait to see the end results he has now lost nine pounds in the second week all right crazy so the transformation comes in a fancy Dancy box like this the company is called piri M these are literally the best highest quality products that I have ever come across they are all raw organic non-gmo they're even kosher we've had some Jewish people reach out to us so I'm gonna open this box give us another one she says I've been doing my best to follow every detail of the plan I've been loosely tracking my calorie intake and I'm very rarely hungry I'm thrilled that I'm not officially down 11 pounds since starting last Friday I'm so thankful for detail instead of listening to God and creating this special group 11 pounds 11 so then that was actually an older Testament she just emailed us she just messaged us again saying she's lost 14 pounds 14 pounds she's lost a pound a day that's amazing what's really cool about this cleanse is babe mail you a schedule in the mail that tells you exactly what to take when to take it so you're not left in the dark nikki is another person to group this is Nathaniel's cousin it's just been really fun to be in this with her she says she's down 9 pounds down 2 inches on my belly and one around my arms I'm so so happy that's gone I'm talking about two weeks two inches off of her stomach okay so the first product that this cleanse comes with and it's kind of like the foundation of the cleanse is the power shake and this thing right here is incredible it is just loaded with superfoods with greens and it just is so satiated and cleanses your body from the inside out and I think a lot of people don't like shakes but the most common response in our group is people are like surprised at how good it like they like the taste and they'll crave it yeah for me personally it took me like a cup like a week or so to get used to it but people have been loving this so that's like the foundation is the power shake so what wait till you get this guy's testimony he is killing all right Roberto says as this morning I'm down to a total of 17 pounds it has been two weeks you guys that's it this two weeks   ridiculous I want to be clear here there that these people it's not like they're bedridden and they're just so weak and they're not eating anything no they are filling their bodies with nutrients everything their body wants and most of them are feeling better than they've ever felt while losing this much weight and we've had a couple people say that they've done cleanses before but this is by far the easiest one they've ever done yeah and a common response also is energy everyone seems to be having increased energy levels which is really good yes so another cool thing is the company they mail you a bottle to create your shake that has like this little this little shaker ball in there that blends it up really good and then they give you a nice little tape measure to measure your before and after results and then one of my favorite probably my favorite and a lot of people's favorite is the apothecary so this apothecary is a cherry it's Organic cherry juice concentrate and basically it's equivalent to consuming ten servings of blueberries and so it's just loaded with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties but what's really cool is that it helps your body produce melatonin it doesn't have melatonin in it otherwise I'd be against it but it helps your body produce natural melatonin and I have been asleep in my craw Kevin yes though but I even talked in his sleep he hasn't done that in our whole marriage he's sleeping deep enough to be talking about yes this will make you have some sweet dreams janessa says this place has been going so great I've been sleeping so well which has helped my productivity and attention span I've lost 10 pounds which is great and janessa is a type one diabetic and she says that my blood sugar numbers have been incredible all capital letters which is also amazing I'm very thankful not only for the physical change but also the spiritual change I felt much closer to Christ and his love has also felt more relevant in near praise the Lord that's awesome so it's not just like weight loss see that you know diabetics see in their blood sugar levels normalize we had a girl say that she's had knee pain for the first time in a long time that she's been pain-free and her knee which is just so there's so many cool things going on the next product that you get is what they call the super aminos and these are just straight-up amino acids apparently every pill is equivalent to 10 grams of meat protein and what's really cool is they actually give these to bedridden coma patients that like can't move and to help reduce the muscle atrophy these help preserve muscle and even build muscle even if you're not working out so it's gotta be his favorite thing in the whole world these kids one day we're he feels like he's like the tears yes so I've been loving it and I've actually noticed a difference in my workouts to which I'm really happy about our tailor says I was 125 yesterday and this morning I was 120 2.4 and then she also she's in the army and she posted a picture of herself in her old uniform that she hasn't been able to fit in since before she got pregnant and now she was just wearing it yeah that was so cool to see I just love seeing results like that it's just like lightens me up makes my day I can resonate with that after pregnancy trying to fit into your old clothes I know that's a good feeling so one of the other products that they have is what they call biomedic so this one is very interesting there's a chemical and roundup which roundup is like the what they spray all of our crops with that causes cancer and it's like called glider phosphate or something might be saying it wrong but there's a chemical that pretty much all of us have in our bodies that this is the product that gets rid of that chemical and that chemical has been proven to cause cancer that's what's really cool about this Reagan says so far with this challenge I've already lost 10 pounds this has been so amazing with helping me transform my lifestyle to focus more on getting healthy and being a good steward of my body if you're someone who struggles with not eating the right foods I suggest this cleanse for you it's been so easy for me and I feel the best I've ever felt see that's what I'm talking about it's one thing to lose 10 pounds in two weeks but it's another thing to lose

journey and join us July 1st for our next cleanse we'll see you there oesn't matter what we say oh that's Satan that's Satan messing me up you guys a houseboat any mores what everyone's gonna say            what's up guys Natan Sutton back with another video and today we are talking about all kind of goodness what's new we've been getting a lot of messages from you guys asking to voice our opinions on the racial tension going on in the world right now and we're gonna be quick on it but basically what we have to say is that we love black people we love them just like we love everybody else we have black friends our pastor that marry this was black yeah we kind of thought it went without saying but it obviously didn't cuz we've been kidding an overwhelming amount of comments and messages so we just thought we would put it here to clear it all up and tell him about what you feel like God told you last night I woke up in the middle of the night with this random thought that I believe came from God and he was saying why does everyone care what you and Nathaniel think and I was like I don't know I really don't know why they care and I feel like he was saying what they should care about is that I love them and I care about them and they should find their identity in me like I love them enough to send my son to die for their sins to offer them eternal life in a relationship with me what does it matter what you and if they don't think mm-hmm and so that's not why I tell you guys it's like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter our opinion like everyone keeps asking our opinion what do you think about this it doesn't matter what we think what anyone else thinks what matters is that God loves you God cares about you we do - we do we do love you we love you so much whether you are red yellow black or white it doesn't matter what we think what matters is that God loves you the Creator the one who created you he says you matter and speaking of that God says that we matter so much that he loves all of us so much that he has a plan for our life he actually created that plan before you even existed in Ephesians 1:4 it says for he chose us in him before the creation of the to be holy and blameless in his sight God has a plan laid out for us in his word and if we would just follow his word we would figure out the plan for our life and his plan is gonna be the best plan possible for us and we aren't saying that his plans for your life are always going to be the easiest it may require walking up mountains or through some valleys but his plans will be the best and we want you and we want us to experience the plans that he has for our lives so the question we have for you is have you ever asked God to reveal to you the plan that he has for your life have you ever asked him if you're following his will or his purpose for you and if he has a plan for your life don't you think that he wants to guide you through that plan well the answer is yes because in psalm 32 eight he says I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go I will counsel you with my loving eye on you so if we want God to be the guide of our lives some things that people don't think about is that we would need to listen to him and I was saying that they own the other day that during my journaling time we told you about that another video I felt like God was telling me pray without ceasing which is a verse in the Bible and ceasing means to come to an end so pray without like pray without ever stopping that's pretty crazy it made me think that maybe the majority of our prayer life should be listening because who can talk all day besides you it's skinny God has a plan for our lives and he's constantly trying to reveal that to us but it's up to us to listen to him take the time and listen yes it is our responsibility to listen if anyone has ears to hear let him hear so is it possible that God has been speaking to you but you haven't been listening so how does God speak to us you might want to know one of his primary ways as through his written word the Bible and the Bible is the ultimate authority God also speaks to us through prayer and I can hear many of you saying right now well I've never heard God speak to me and our response to that would be is it because you're not listening how many of the times do you go in prayer and you're the one that's doing all the talking how often do you stop and ask God to speak to you and to just be still and listen yeah we do that at night where we we do our prayers together and it's a lot of like thank you for this and thank you for that and then asking for things and we never really were taking time to just sit quietly and listen to what he has to say to us so that's what we're starting to implement in our lives is quiet time where we are just sitting being still and listening for God's voice so as you can see God speaks to us in all kinds of ways he can speak to us through his word through prayer through circumstances he can speak to us through other people he can speak to us in so many different ways and we believe that he's constantly trying to speak to us but the key is is we have to be listening for it it's unwise to think that he has a plan for our life but we are unwilling to listen for him to guide us through it so our advice to you is to take that time out of your day to sit still and say to God God what do you have for me what do you want to say to me and just take the time to listen and see if he reveals anything to you I it makes us think of the verse of the Bible be still and I was telling him the other day that that's just so relevant in today's world because everyone seems to have such a hard time with that just being still like that's - yes even if you are still like even if you're just sitting there you want to listen to music or you want to listen to a podcast you can't just sit with nothing and like just sit in silence so it's important to do that and I we have found that that's the best way for us to hear God speaking to us yes distractions and it's just so cool - since we've been doing that since we've been intentionally making time for God you know just opening the door and having an open space for him inviting him to speak to us it's been so cool to see how he has spoken to me and Sutton in so many different cool ways you know sometimes I feel like he's directly saying something to me and other times I feel like he's giving me visions like yesterday I felt like he was just giving me this vision of him just being this huge like massive of comforters and like me just laying in his arms and like that's how my life should be and just that's when he's when he's talking about how his yoke is easy that it that's how our life should be is just resting in his arms and not always striving and like trying to worry about everything and control everything but that his yoke is easy so it's just that was this one cool example of how I feel like he's he's given me visions he's given me words it's just been amazing but also when you if you're doing this time don't get discouraged if it's just silence like you don't hear anything because the most important thing is just having that intentional time with God and being in his presence you don't have to hear anything you don't have to have a vision just spend that time together and I would go so far to even say go into your time with God not expecting anything or having an expected outcome just be open to whatever happens maybe it's just you sitting in his presence he might speak to you he may not I felt like our number one priority should be to be in his presence and that when you were in his presence and delighting in that then it seems like amazing things start to happen so be still get quiet and just seek your eyes on him and his presence and love it and see see what what happens but I do think it's so important to go into it and ask questions ask them Heavenly Father what do you want to say to me today is that maybe there's a certain area in your life that you're struggling with ask them how do you want how do you want me to handle this area in my life and if you hear something write it down you know that's what we've been doing is that we feel like when God speaks to us we've been writing it down that way we can go back weeks months years later and see all the amazing things that God has shared with us and we'll tell you right now that if you take this time with God Satan is going to get in your head and make you wonder like is this from God are these just my own thoughts and so weighted test and know if it's God speaking to you is to compare it to his word is it consistent with that does it follow that if it doesn't it's not from him if it does maybe it is if it's producing good fruit in your life and filling you with love and joy in peace then it probably is from God now if you feel like God is telling you something that is going to change the direction of your life such as quitting a job or you feel like God's telling you that you need to marry this person like these big directional changes in your life that you know you can't necessarily find that in the Bible and we suggest that you seek counsel on that go to your brothers and sisters in Christ maybe a pastor and share with them what you feel like God told you and and that counsel will hopefully help you determine whether or not you really thought it was from God another way that I have found God speaking to us is through a restlessness like a restless spirit you know you may feel something on your heart that you can't stop thinking about or you feel like this is to talk to this person or do this something and I feel like that sometimes God nudging at us and it can be silly things to like the other night for example me and Sutton were going to bed and we were kind of not in the happiest mood too thick and I was really tempted just to you know go to sleep and not say goodnight or kiss her because I feel like I'm always the one that does that but I do but I but I felt like I was just sitting there just thinking about it and like thinking about I just felt uneasy about it so I kissed her goodnight and told her I loved her even though I felt a little mad at her a lot of people might would say that God doesn't speak to us in today's time but that's hard for us to believe because we know that Satan speaks to us all day long so it's really hard to believe that he would speak to us but God who loves us and cares about us and his deepest desire is a relationship with us that he wouldn't speak to us mm-hmm and I think it's so important to have a listening ear not only during prayer time or during you to quiet time with him but all day like it's a radio station that you're trying to tune into because you want and desire so much to hear his voice so in every circumstance whether you're waking up or eating a meal or talking to somebody you're out in nature or praying whatever it is always have that listening ear of asking God what you what are you trying to say to me right now pray without ceasing be in tune all day which is so hard to do and I'm not going to pretend like we have that mastered by any means this is something that we are currently trying to do more and more of so it's so difficult but that's what we're here to do a problem with hearing his voice nowadays is that we are all just too busy like that's what we think is that we're just too busy to take the time to sit and listen but who could be too busy for God say what you were saying that last night at dinner like who he is like oh yeah yes so one thing that I've been doing is when I've been going into my quiet time with him is I love starting it off with just realizing Who am I trying to communicate with right now I'm communicating with the creator of me the one who created me you know that allows me to breathe allows me to see that I'm just standing here on this planet earth in the middle of the universe with millions of stars surrounding me like that's who I'm trying to communicate with and I think having that all who this amazing God is and it shouldn't be taken lightly either the things that were visiting herself with are blessings from God like I was telling him last night our kids you know we're very busy taking care of them it's over there such a blessing does like why why would we put them over God when they came from God like he gave us them so I don't know it's just so important to spend that time with God and not use your busy as an excuse to not spend time with them yeah and I think if we really get honest with ourselves we're not too busy for how much time he's been on Instagram and on face and sleeping and YouTube and YouTube if you're watching this video you have enough time and what I have personally found is that it seems as though when I feel too busy but I spend time with God anyway that it seems like more time he creates more time in my day it like doesn't even make sense like I feel like I have the same to-do list but somehow they just get done faster so that's been another fascinating thing about it the reason you might not be willing to listen to God is because you're afraid of what he might tell you so are you willing to open your heart and open your mind and say God what do you want me to do I will do it and it makes me think of Abraham in the Bible you know him and Sarah tried for years and years years to have a kid God finally bless him with a kid and then he tells him to bring him up to this mountain like sacrifice his only son like are we willing to do something that crazy like something like that that committed to listening to God and doing what he wants us to do and if you can't say yes to that question it means that you don't fully trust God and isn't it silly to think that we wouldn't trust God that he has a perfect plan for our lives because we know that because he's a loving God he wants the best for us it's just silly to think that we want his plan for our life but we don't trust him for it yeah you don't know the end of that story Abraham does commit in his heart to kill his son sacrifice him and as he's about to do it God tells him to stop and he's just seeing if he was gonna obey and gives him a lamb to sacrifice and said another reason you may not be listening for God's voice is because you have sin in your life do you really think that your heart is going to be open to hearing God's voice if you are refusing to give up a sin in your life because more than likely you know what he's gonna tell you don't expect God to fight you over that he will convict you over and over and over again and if you decide in your heart that you are not going to listen to him don't be surprised if God ends you over to yourself and lets you make a mess of your life the thing about us is that we are always listening all day long you're listening to somebody but the question is whose voice are you listening - are you listening to your peers to your family are you gonna listen to God's voice because he's trying to talk to you - what's even worse to think about is that when we don't listen to God's voice other people suffer today is Father's Day so I'm speaking to all the dads out there including myself that when we don't listen to God's voice our family is going to suffer we have the authority in our homes we have the responsibility to lead our families the way that we treat our children the way we talk to our wives the way that we lead by example if we want our children to grow up listening for God's voice how do we expect that to happen if we ourselves are not listening for God's voice and if we want our children to be living their life in God's plan how do we expect that if we are not living our lives in God's plan you want your kids to not remember this first time they ever saw you praying or listening to God's voice because it was so early on in their lives that they don't even know the first time they saw it it should just be so normal that your children see you praying that you're praying with them that you're praying for them that you're talking about God that you're reading the Bible it should just be such a normal day in the life if you don't give your family your kids the example of listening to God's voice on a consistent basis you are depriving them of the greatest gift you could ever give them so to wrap this video up we're gonna leave you with the question and then a take-home message our question to you is out of 24 hours in a day how much time are you listening for God's voice and our take-home message is that every day make a practice of getting alone with God be still get quiet in his presence be in awe of who he is listen for his voice and his guidance in your life so that you can make wise decisions for your life and when you hear him speak it's a good idea to write it down because that way you can look back on that years from now and see all the cool and amazing things God has told you throughout your life and if you've never accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior we can tell you what he's saying to you today he's saying to you turn away from your sins accept him as your Lord and Savior he died for you and gave you the free gift of eternal life all you have to do is accept that gift alright guys this is Nate and Sutton sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one more time and that was God's plan for your life and how to listen to his voice it's date night it's date night and that means we're vlogging because what else do we do in our lives nothing we just sit down what the what the what the heck what       okay see ya thank you okay where's your eye lucky saying yeah yeah say no Levi hey what's up guys welcome to another vlog it is so I know we can hardly look at this camera some of you may have noticed that we took down this video and are now reuploading it and that's because you guys got crazy on us oh so if there are those of you that saw our last video we were making a video of me and Sutton in our two little ones he's getting ready to step off a cliff okay are you getting ready to step off that big cliff anyway we were driving in the car to the pool which by the way the pool is right behind that tree so this is our road pool day for our opinion been walking safer than a golf car which a lot of our neighbors and stuff ride golf carts around here yeah so we're not promoting that you should we should be driving with our kids without seatbelts but a lot of y'all so what happened was a lot of y'all got on our case about driving them in the front seat without the seatbelts on or without them in the car seats we're not saying it's okay to drive with your kids without seatbelts but I don't think we made in the video very clear how close the pool is it's literally what do you say a 15-second Drive yeah a 15-second Drive and people driving our neighborhood all the time on a golf carts and a Sutton's sister has almost been hit by a car walking in the neighborhood with her children but still I we we didn't make it clear that's what we were doing and Saab so we took the video down people were saying they were gonna like call CPS on us and stuff or not yeah so we just gotta be careful and we're just gonna go that was his hand I killed the snake last night on our porch and so I'm a little paranoid but anyway yeah so we definitely are all for putting your kids in their seatbelts and we would never do anything to put our kids in danger but anyway so we took that part out and put this in instead so enjoy the video yeah okay come down the hill come on oh he does this every day and does involve look he doesn't care yeah good job you toss okie did that hurt see I'm tough see I'm tough on the city ride superhero outfit on yeah all right what we're doing is the Thanos about to kill this dinosaur bug that flew in our house the other day it's not she said that she trapped this massive bug underneath the blonde kill it like if he can kill this bug I'm gonna be shocked let's just say that bug killing is not my best skill no it's not but he's got his cape on under here yeah what do you do this well how the heck I have to push it up what if it hits my fingers oh no you gotta figured out it's part of it well so just open it like this no cuz you can't get in there to kill it maybe I should slightly open to see where okay this is some kind of prank no okay let me show it it's not that was such a exaggeration look at the camera looks like a fly okay that thing is like as big as my pinky if you can not tell how big it is look at that thing it's like he's sitting put your finger there just so I tell you something that I've been doing recently that I feel like has been life-changing is when I'm hanging out with this little guy I get my little time which way this way I get my time with Tom at the end of the day that I do not go on social media I don't check my emails I don't check Instagram Facebook and I really just give him my undivided attention especially for me I work from my home I work from my cell phone it can be really easy for me to fall into the trap of like watching him and then checking my phone and before I know it I'm spending like a lot of time on my phone that's not good that's not good I don't think that's something I would look back on my life one day and be proud of and I gotta give credit where credit's due Sutton my wife calling me out on it but yeah for those of you parents out there I highly suggest when you're watching your kids and you're playing with your kids give them your undivided attention you won't regret it they're worth it mommy's little man ready to show us your room you're the star today hello guys welcome to my room - it just look at it it's still not done but we just figured we'd show you guys anyways let's just start here so this is if you guys remember I posted a picture at Christmas time I hang these on our stockings and I was so nervous I wasn't gonna find an H for him because Hobby Lobby doesn't sell them anymore but I found one on my app I've told you guys about before it's called mercury if you want to get on it we can link it below but that's where I found that so I'm very happy about it this little shelf still

really he's got a drawer but like right now we're only using one drawer speaking of this drawer tell him about this Big Mama so this we thrown on Facebook marketplace I had to go pick it up which was the only thing I seemed to do to contribute to this room okay this rug I got a world market and it actually came with a stain on it and it wasn't gonna stain but the fabric was a different color and in a spot and they sent me and brand new on and like dimming and the other one back which I thought was very nice and then we have this blackout curtains so these make the room really dark and I got these at Target why don't you tell him how many hours this little guy slept last night he has been in his own crib for the past two nights now which was kind of scary for us and he made it from I fed him at 8:30 and then he slept all the way until 6:15 that's like what nine hours let me just go ahead mention before everyone calls me out I know that some of these things is remote tags her her mom I gotta say that her and her mom are so funny about like if you go in her parents house like half the things in their house still have tags on them but y'all you have to like live with something for a little bit before you realize that you really like it like you got to live with it before you commit like that shelf still has the tag on it right there but that I'm committed to that needs to come off like the other tag is we're gonna make a video about how to get your baby to sleep through the night because who cuz we got a professional here and you know do you think his eyes are blue so we were been going over this debate with our family whether his eyes are blue or not some people say they're blue some people say they're gonna be brown I think they're gonna be blue cuz he wants to be like me thumbs up for baby noises crib is Pottery Barn I think it's a really different style than Oakland's crib because this is like a lot more modern which I like and my favorite part of this room is this name sign that we got me for him so we found this R on Instagram and her shop is called pearl and pine and y'all she is so talented I chose something really simple because that's what I wanted

kind of just like a handyman he's been doing all kinds of stuff around our house for a while now and he showed her a picture of this wall and he just did he nailed it and I know that a lot of y'all were asking the color when I posted the picture on Instagram you're asking what the paint color is and I don't know it off the top of my head but we will also put that in the description we'll go look at the cannon tell you what it's called that's pretty much it that's pretty much it we keep it simple around here I told me they nice I think will live in this house until we move out and it still

we're losing them we'll see you later bye bye what's up guys Natan setting back with another video and today we are talking about how to know if your crush likes you we get a lot of questions on Instagram mainly about dating just so many questions revolved around dating sterling let's do a video about that and what can we do and this what we came up with yeah and looking back on my dating career I I could've really used this kind of insight because I was pretty oblivious I took a lot of signals as if they were green lights when they might have been red lights just because someone doesn't show all of these signs doesn't mean that they're not interested in you but these are very good signs that they like you let's go so the first one is that they asked you a lot of questions you know all about this one don't you yeah that's all we did on our first date was we just call her like the question game where we would just go back and forth asking each other questions and this is kind of a good example of that not all of these apply like so sudden she was asking me a lot of questions but I wasn't really asking you much questions not because I didn't like her but because I was just didn't know how to have a conversation I told these thing was like if I ask you a question the easiest things to say what about you like he doesn't have to come up with a question just use my question mm-hmm which is a good dating tip is ask questions yeah you should always know more about the other person than they know about you my dad taught me that when I was little it makes you it makes the other person feel really good everyone likes talking about themselves the next way to know if your crush likes you is if you guys make plans to hang out together and for whatever reason it doesn't work out if they initiate an alternative plan like another time to hang out that's a good sign this is such a big one and one that I just didn't recognize early on in my dating life and I wish I would have because it could have saved me so much pain and frustration that what happened just it happened so many times where like like I would have a date point I was somehow convinced ago to go on a date with me and then they might cancel for some stupid reason but then they would never follow up it's like well I can't hang out tonight but would you like to hang out this time would you hang up would you like to hang out another day and if they don't do that that's not a good sign not a good sign yeah they come no they might not respond yeah I know but now we know it was just God protecting me and saving me for a second but back then I thought there was something wrong but that actually happened to us too because when he asked me to hang out the first time ever we picked a day and then that he couldn't do it that day and I was like dang I was so looking forward to it and I was like now what are we gonna do like what if he doesn't come up with something else and we were talking about that ID we don't remember what happened but I think what happened was he didn't initiate something else and I said like well what about another day or something that's just because I was playing games and stupid the case in point is this if your date cancels on you and they say well I can't hang out this time but I would love to hang out next weekend that's a good sign yeah but if they cancel on you and don't show any interest in other plans it's not looking good another dead giveaway that your crush likes you as if they are the ones initiating conversations they're texting you they're calling you they're snapchatting you if they're the ones that are initiating it greenlight also message to the girls I feel like it's a common thing to wait for the guy to text you all the time or call you all the time but you know if you want to talk to them you can text them too because they're probably living by these same rules like you know if you text him first and he'll be like oh she's interested in me but if you never say anything to him or like never reach out he's like I might be bothering her like if I keep texting her so don't be afraid to put yourself out there to at least some of the times yeah another thing that's probably pretty common is that they might be a little awkward or nervous around you if they like you if they stutter on the words or they just don't make sense that was me and another good sign is if they compliment you you know if they tell you that you're beautiful or that you look good that you're smart do you know your first compliment to me wasn't mine to you that your face is really symmetrical I thought it was my hair maybe I did say that yeah I think he said that my teeth look fake yeah I assume his teeth were real when we first on our first date that's a compliment yeah man you feel pretty good about myself it's another clue that your crush might like you is if when you're talking to them they tell you personal information about themselves like they're really opening up to you and not just keeping it surface level like boring stuff yeah they might share their dreams with you their ambitions where they want to be going in life their past do you remember the first thing just happened do you remember the first personal information that we gave each other I know we got there fast is all I know oh yeah it was like our very first sentence you know on Facebook I told you I asked security yeah yeah I think within our very first conversation we discovered that we were virgins yeah but it wasn't in an awkward way like are you a virgin like that it was somehow whatever we were saying it like naturally flowed into that I wouldn't know how that happened but it wasn't like weird yeah there yeah another dead giveaway is if they laugh at you very easily like you maybe even you may be saying something that you don't even think it's funny at all but they just find a reason to laugh at you for whatever and or they try to be funny they try to make you laugh everyone like someone funny did you think I was funny not at first you didn't what did you do no not at first I didn't think he had like a silly personality but yeah after PI like our I don't know third or fourth time hanging out then you started to really come out yeah it takes it takes me a little while to let my goofy side come out big is to give away if they like you is that they initiate touch like holding your hand or maybe like fixing your hair like brushing shoulders or something like when they're talking to you they like do that some people just have that personality they do that anyway but it's it's a good sign yeah I always tried to find a reason to touch her I what was the way oh yeah you want to tell them how I first initiated holding hands guys don't take this as a note are you kidding this is awesome you're so proud of this moment but it was just like lame it made you seem scared to hold my hand like just on your own hand they make something up you do it let's reenact it so we're in the car here we go so you want to see what it feels like to hold my hand and then it began I think that's way let's see what it feels like instead of just like I think that's way but to me that's kind of awkward just like all the sudden like like no comments you should use that for the kiss too      I think that one I just laid on you didn't I yeah no I think we I think we were talking about like what we were thinking about or something mm-hmm you said so smooth the last one that we really feel like is a obvious sign that they like you is if they stare at you like maybe if you're in class and you like notice them just staring at you like that's pretty obvious or they smile at you a lot like when you're talking to them and have a big grin on their face if anyone has this weird ability to smile while he's talking no matter what he's saying even if he's like saying sometimes back he just says it like this like you know now you know like from RBF which is me and I was like the opposite of that he's just always like talking about the smile I'm just a jolly old fellow but anyway guys that's pretty much it I think those are the biggest dead giveaways that your crushes into you it's easy for a lot of us to be in denial like me like if you if you want something to work out but it's not working out you might convince yourself that they like you and they really don't so look for the signs yeah and if there's any other dating topics you guys wants to cover put it in the comments we can make little videos like this about certain topics because we get asked any questions just all the time mm-hmm and I will say that it is possible for somebody to like you and not show these signs actually sometimes people will play that game and they'll purposely not give you any signs because they don't want you to know that they're interested in you which is just so silly but we recommend if they're doing that probably not the kind of person you want to be with anyway all right guys well this is natan Sutton sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that's how to know if your crush likes you do we ever kiss I'm Carrie that was planted but it was it oh we allowed the kiss on camera  don't know what time technically starts a nighttime routine but it's five o'clock so that's nighttime to me so what time it is for him to be eating dinner and he's got his favorite thing on the menu tonight which is salmon and sweet potatoes we got Levi here for the crumbs and then we got little hauls a year just so long for the show right this is his favorite thing ever you love it so good if anyone's wondering if he ate all that he did dad came down to play he's about to be on duty this is what we do every day we come down around 5:30 after I'm done working and I think yeah so I have them from 7:00 a.m. to 5:30 and then he comes down and takes over so I can shower and stuff next up brokey is the last little bit of his green juice so we make him sound beeping in there I know we make it a big thing in this for the week and then he just drinks on it all week so this is his final day but he's been drinking such big cups that now it's looked and you might not even like it just by this point it's been it's like four days old there you go believe I always get so jealous of me and okey time he wants to be involved I include him say hey to everybody say hey I'm almost one and a half years old alright I just dropped hassan off with Nathaniel so this is my time in the night I go in 30 minutes to shower put the laundry away things I need to do upstairs this one my favorite times my day because I get to be by myself which sounds kind of mean but you know you love your kids to death but when you get a little break it's nice but before we get shower I wanted to thank function of beauty for sponsoring this video it is a shampoo conditioner and hair care line which is amazing they actually

you know that I've been having this issue with like waxing this in my hair that's how I would describe it it took me forever to find something that would work to tame it I finally found a shampoo that was working it tamed it but I thought I took the softness out of my hair I felt like when I found this company I honestly didn't even want to try it because I was like my hair is so weird I've been looking for shampoos for years I haven't found anything that works this is probably not gonna work not you know waste my time but I tried it anyways and I'm so glad I did because it stinkin worked you

yeah got our cherry tomatoes come in and heck yeah oh yeah I can eat these things like candy so I've been having this weird obsession lately with sugar snap peas and carrots I've just been eating them raw and they are so good all three of us yes and good looking boys oh I just too much time he's so learn how to kiss without tunnel hey Toki you won't go watch Blue's Clues it wouldn't be a nighttime routine without some Blue's Clues read oke done with my shower and came down to this little angel taking his nap alright so it's time for me and Oakland to go take a bath we recently upgraded to the bathtub which he has been loving oh boy he really gets left out these days back downstairs now I'm putting the dishes away cleaning up the kitchen we tell you all something I this whole nighttime routine stuff is a real team effort and it has made me have so much respect for single moms I mean I already did but doing this whole nighttime thing which seems like the hardest most busiest part of the day most busy part of it has really just show like I just I just think about the single moms all the time like what what I'm showering I'm like what do they do they must just have to wait until their kids go to sleep or something which man when they go to sleep all I want to do is chill I don't want to be showering or doing anything else so you're a single mom out there you are a superwoman in my eyes I left out the dads there are single dads out there we had one in our transformation group a single dad I have girls how cool is that he has five girls and he's doing it all by himself and I'm just like how do you do that but it's just so great I mean it's so great for them like so cool and I really look up to that it's so funny my mom got Oakland this Easter this Easter book and he always pulls it out to us and always points to Jesus without us even asking there's like three and then and he'll like go through it and point right to them good job it's so funny he just opens the book and points to Jesus I think that's a good sign right okay you love Jesus there's like all these characters and then he always points right to Jesus bath time is over it's time for Oakland's bottle and then one of our favorite times of the day tonight we're doing hamburgers and sweet potato fries my all-time favorites all right seven o'clock which means it's time for okie dabs milk one of his favorite times of the day and they were so gobbled sleeping baby over there and nothing else back there doing his burger duties but those of you guys that are looking for an epic dinner recipe I got you covered right here so these are the sweet potato fries we use alexia sweet potato fries delish then we get some grass-fed ground beef because we're healthy like that I seasoned it with onion powder garlic salt and this is - bottle time is done this is my last little bit of the day with okie beer so we usually just come in here and play until it's time for bed as well 7:10 right now and he goes down at like 7:30 and Nathaniel is doing the meat for dinner a lot of the time dinner he spends a little bit more time on dinner than I do because we pretty much should grill everything that we which is kind of his realm so I usually do whatever we're having as a side and then he does the meat you ready to play yeah   right it's night time for okie say night-night okie that's his little signature move right there you think you I love you okie name oh yeah there we go look at the juices flowing that little ones for okie for lunch tomorrow doing this part of our dinner so I'm toasting us some bread I use brioche bread Nathaniel likes honey wheat and then we make this sauce which is not the healthiest sauce it's not the healthiest thing in the world but it you want to take your sweet tooth fries up a notch this is so much salt Duke's mayonnaise and some barbecue sauce it doesn't really matter what kind of use but we use this kind and mix it together till it's like this color all right we made it the best time today we got 30 minutes before this little guy wakes up but in the meantime we get to enjoy and for now we sit on the couch and eat dinner but we've talked about when our kids get older we're gonna have family dinners at the table yeah that's true it was just us stick around you gotta live it up while we can he's out back there at night we eat cookies cookies as big as the plate yeah we'll get yours I got my two cookies right there give me a glass of milk and be ready to go Austin's getting his back right now I gave Hassan his bath and it down does okie it'll be nice next week they're gonna get on the same schedule and then they can have their best together which would make things way easier but he's really grown to like this it used to be very stressful time but now they seem so right it's nine o'clock which means it's bad time for this little guy look at his little outfit this is a six-month ones you guys and is not even two months old and it's not that much too big for him old tip when you're laying your baby down it's important to lay them down awake I know that can be hard a lot of us want to rock them to sleep or like feed them to sleep it's very important that these lies are open you know if you could see it's a dark up here but that's how they learn to fall asleep on their own without having to be rocked so here he goes he's going down we made it does anyone else just feel so accomplished when you get in the bed his idea was like yes yeah now we say our prayers go to sleep early birds get up but mean that they are not early Birds naturally we sleep in the way we say our prayers is pretty unique some of y'all know this because you we just said this before I'm pretty sure yeah for those of you who don't know our secret recipe how do we do it these are only married prayers you can't do this if you're not married we are not married you need to be praying vertically not horizontally that's right Church told us but one of us says the prayer and the other one gives the person saying the prayer a massage it's been so great for us because we get really tired this time of day and so whoever saying the prayer is getting the massage it gives you incentive to say a longer prayer and more prayers and the one that is giving the massage it helps keep you awake it gives you something to do for me it helps keep me awake when I'm the one saying the prayer because I don't know about you guys but if I'm just laying here with my eyes closed like praying to myself I'll just fall asleep no no it's like impossible for me which is kind of a good thing I think because it's like you're falling asleep like you know talking to God instead of like letting your mind wander to like bad things but I just feel like it's it's just like doing a disservice or something you're just not acting like he's important enough for me to stay awake and I don't like to feel like that so I really like that we say our prayers out loud this has been very good method for us we've been doing it for years and ever since we've been married pretty much yeah I think so we don't think it's weird but it works for us all right you guys well thank you all for joining us for our night and we will see you next time all right guys hopefully i can make it through this video we were trying to think of what kind of video we were going to shoot this week and we weren't really sure but this just happened so figured maybe this is what it's supposed to be about i was praying and i just i just started weeping because i was starting to think about all the things that we take for granted and i think it really stems from last night i had a dream about halston where basically i went in to his room and he wasn't awake and and so i was praying to god today i was thinking about all the things that we take for granted and just like how every every time we wake up with another day it's a gift and whether it's you waking up or your spouse waking up or your children waking up it's such a gift and i just felt so guilty about all the things that i've taken for granted and you know a lot of times i wake up and i don't even thank god for not only them but all of my family and all the things that god has blessed us with and i just think it's a great reminder to always be in a state of thankfulness   yep it's crazy to think that you know he just had the dream of like waking up and your kid not waking up but for some people that's like their reality and i literally cannot fathom that idea like i don't know how people go through something like that and i just my heart breaks for those people yeah i was thinking about how if anything ever happened to you know something or kids or you know or family just how every day i would i would just think back like wow i would do anything them for them to be here with me and how that happens to so many people that's so many people's realities and yet when we're just living day by day and just taking things for granted it really should bring us to repentance before god it's it's like a tragedy the gifts that he gives us and how much we take them for granted and uh i just feel like no matter where you're at in life i'm sure there's a lot of people watching this video that has had something tragic like that happened to them and i just like no matter where you're at if you're waking up with breath in your lungs there's something to be grateful for and you know some of us it may be more obvious than others but   no matter where you're at and what you're going through i just i wanted this video to be an encouragement to you watching to be thankful for what god has blessed you with because it could be taken away today it could be taken away tomorrow nothing is guaranteed yeah it's a good reminder for every day just wake up and thank god that you're alive you're awake and you're healthy and it made me realize how much i have my eyes not set on eternity because if we were seeing it from god's perspective you know we would see the big picture in our eyes on eternity and just you know realizing that life is so much more than our time here on earth and eternity this time on earth is just a blink of the eye and so i just pray for us and for all of you guys that god gives us the strength to keep our eyes on eternity and that that is what matters the most and that our time here on earth is just it's a vapor right okay and it's one of our verses do not be anxious about anything but in everything through prayer and petition with thanksgiving let your request be known to god and i really believe that it's god's will for our lives to be in a state of thanksgiving all the time thankful for all circumstances first thessalonians 5 18 give thanks in all circumstances for this is god's will for you in christ jesus so you know that's god's will for our lives is that in every circumstance to be thankful and if you find yourself complaining a lot and losing perspective of what really matters i think it's a wake-up call because we have so much to be thankful for and it's just crazy and there's so much more to life than the little things that we do get upset about yeah but it's our natural tendency you know our the world drags us down and satan wants us to lose sight of the good things the good gifts that god has given us but this is just your reminder that maybe you've been losing sight of what really matters and losing sight of that constant state of being thankful and i hope this is a good reminder to you and it's a good reminder to me and me so yeah that's our short video this week it's funny i we didn't really know what we're gonna make a video about this week and i feel like here it is god just gave it to us so i hope you all enjoyed it it was a little different and a little more raw than usual sure and sweet and we didn't mean to cry yeah i actually did better than i thought i was i was trying to tell sutton about it and i just could hardly even speak i was so overwhelmed with just gratitude and like i just felt like i should say sorry to god for all the blessings that he's given me that i just overlook on a daily basis all right guys we love you all hope you enjoyed this video we'll see you next week what's up guys nate and sutton back with another video and today we are doing a what day is today today is q a about singleness singleness is what you guys chose if y'all are not following us on instagram you can find us at nate and sutton and on there we ask you guys sometimes questions of like what do you want to have a q a about and if you want to be in on choosing what we talk about find us on instagram yep yep and today we are talking about singleness you guys are asking us some questions on how to cope with the horrific life of being single no i'm just kidding single life can sometimes be better than the coupled life depending on how you handle it if you guys aren't following us on instagram follow us at nate and sutton because we have something exciting coming up and we are going to be sharing it on instagram before we put it on youtube so if you want to know what it is you want to be the first to know find us there yes question number one hit me question number one this is a good one for you is it okay to date more than one person at a time before making it official as a couple that's a good one for me because i tried to pull that game on me yeah all the people that he dated he chose me to do that with i know looking back i would be like to me it's just like an obvious no that i don't think it's okay i just feel like it's not really honoring to either one of the people that you're dating but uh back then in my dating game i felt a little more desperate and i was like what if she doesn't work out i need to have a backup that's horrible but i would personally suggest no i don't think that's a good idea you know how would you feel if you were the one of the two yeah yeah how would that make you feel is there anything you miss about being single for me that is a no um yeah i don't trying to think hard here and i think just about everything is better with you and my life wow how can we be content in a time of waiting that's probably the million dollar question about you that i got asked a lot i think one thing is just trusting god knowing that like you know he has a plan for your life regardless of what you're doing he has a plan for you and you can just find peace and knowing that there is a plan for you yeah and not only that you know we've talked about this in some of our other videos but i just think it's so important to be able to be content with yourself you know if you're always looking for somebody else to complete you and to make you happy well guess what when you get in a relationship it's probably not going to be what you expected it to be how to spot a godly man or woman god says that we will know them by their fruits so that's a good way to analyze someone do they have the fruits of the spirit what are the fruits of the spirit son love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control so do they have those fruits then maybe maybe that's a good sign yeah and i do highly suggest that conversation if you don't know for sure they're a christian that'd be one of the very first things you talk to them about before you even you know spend time getting to know them yeah for sure not only that i think it's so important that you you don't just have a surface level conversation about this topic to really you know because a lot of people are like yeah yeah i'm a christian i believe in jesus but do they really does their life show it i think that's really important because uh what i see a lot of the times is like it's kind of an uncomfortable situation or a conversation to have and then later on down the road they may not be the kind of christian that they thought they were i feel like i've been waiting forever i'm 17 and haven't had my first kiss any advice my advice would be to be patient i would not rush something like that or just be focused on that you know focus on finding someone that you're going to be really interested in not only that i think that's awesome i wouldn't feel this pressure to like have your first kiss you know i think it's so cool when people haven't kissed anyone's until their spouse or until the one that they spend the rest of their life with i think that's really cool some people we film weddings and some people go all the way to their wedding day without kissing someone which how cool is that like your first kiss is on your wedding day wow do you ever wish you met in a different way yes yeah i mean i can't really say that i do because i feel like the way we met was how god intended us to meet but i think it would be cool to have like i always wish that i could have just seen her out in public and like what would i have done yeah me too because i feel 100 confident i would have gone up and talked to her and if that would have happened that would have literally been the first time in my whole life that that's ever happened to me that is very surprising that's true listen there's some scared men out there what do you think about a christian girl dating a non-christian guy don't do it don't do it do not go there yeah god calls us to be equally yoked and i think that's super super important in a relationship probably should be your number one thing that you're looking for yeah and i actually have first-hand experience so i guess i don't know if that would be considered firsthand but i have family that has married christian marrying non-christian and it's just it's crazy the spiritual warfare that goes on in that kind of relationship should you add in that they're divorced they are divorced now how to show a guy that you like him like how would you want a girl to show that she likes you yeah i think it's very important for girls to show that they're interested to some degree in a guy if they are interested because most of the time guys are so scared already to like talk to a girl and like so insecure thinking like they don't like them and not all guys but a lot of guys especially christian guys seem to be this way so i would say if you are interested in a guy you know i mean you don't have to come over to be over the top about it but start conversations initiate conversations maybe compliment him laugh at his jokes don't be afraid to show him that you're interested we're not about those games no games around here how do you prepare yourself for a relationship in the season of singleness one thing we talked about in a previous video is becoming the person you want to be with wants to be with if that makes sense it's a confusing sentence but like whatever you're looking for in someone you should be becoming that person too like whoever i don't even know how to explain what this is like that's it you were doing good yeah who the the kind of person that you are looking for that you want to spend your life with try to become that person so become what they would be looking for yeah yeah it's the most confusing sentence by getting in my head of what i'm trying to say yeah so basically like think to yourself okay here i am thinking all day every day when am i gonna find my spouse when am i gonna find my partner i'm miserable without them do you really want the person that you're looking for to be like that probably not you would want them to be the kind of person that they just love life they love people they love god they could be okay with or without a spouse but they would like to have one so that's probably the kind of person that you're looking for so you should become that person that verse where jesus says whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much you know a lot of the times we think of that from like a of our financial situation if we are faithful and good stewards of the things that god gives us that he can trust us with more so i think that's a good mindset to have when you're single is like okay what has god given me god has given me this life that i'm currently in i'm currently in a season of singleness so i'm going to make the best out of this season i'm going to try to live how god wants me to full of patience and peace and kindness and goodness how do i get rid of unrealistic expectations and how do i know if my standards are too high i feel like that's an interesting question to me because i was always told that like whenever i was looking for certain things to someone they would say like you're gonna have to get over that that you're just expecting way too much that's not out there but guess what you found me he's right here no you're trying to say i always live up to your expectations not always you do now i feel like like now you kind of know i think now you kind of like know what i expect but i i just always feel like i would expect what i give like going back to being the person you want to be with wants to be with i would give these things i just wanted them in return so i knew it was possible because i was doing it yeah i would say that i think there's expectations that are good to have and then there's expectations that you might need to hold on to loosely like yeah you know anything to do with the morals uh you know being faithful in your relationship whether it has to do with social media movies you watch the language that you speak i think all of those things it's very good to have high expectations and high standards but i think other things that might just come along with like personality twerks you know like whether i smack my food or like if they don't look the way like you want someone that's six three but they're five ten like it just doesn't matter yeah so i think there's expectations that are very good to have and then expectations that you might need to let go but i what i see far too much of is what is people having a low standard of the things that they should have a high standard for yeah people are settling out there yeah so as when it comes to character and someone that lives a godly life i think that your standards should be high for that yeah so keep that girl that asks this question let's see your name cassidy you keep those expectations in those standards and the right guy will come along it will help you weed out the ones that you're not meant to be with and another thing is i think if you make your standards very well known and that you hold firm in those standards that it can really inspire people not only just people in general but also the person that you're dating like i think you i think sutton did that to me what you know like i feel like you had some standards that i wasn't meeting in the beginning and it made me realize like yeah i should be meeting those standards yeah that goes with the dating the two people at the same time thing that we were talking about that was very early on in us dating like we probably hung out twice and my mom had been telling me like are you sure he's not dating someone else she's like he's a little too good to be true and i would i was telling her like i don't think so let me just ask him and so i did and he had to tell me and i basically said like something like uh i'm not i'm not doing that with you yeah she basically told me that if i continue to do that she's not gonna continue dating me and i was like okay i'm out out with her now yeah out with her and in with you and then also um you know if you've watched our video on pornography in our early stages of dating i had a little issue with that and she made it very known to me that that was not okay and i knew it wasn't okay but it coming from her really just straightened me out what is wrong about living together before marriage first of all one thing i always think is like if you have the desire to get married don't live with the person that you're wanting to get married to because that gives them no incentive to propose to you or ask you to marry them because they're already getting everything they want they have you hashtag girl talk yeah so like what i there's like no incentive for them to ask you but if you keep those boundaries you know it gives them incentive and it's so much more exciting of like when you get married you're starting your lives together you get to move in together and experience all these new things not to say that you can't have a great marriage you know for those of you that did live together beforehand not saying that you guys are horrible yeah i think this is a tricky area for a lot of christians because that desire to live with each other is so strong you know in the engagement season of life and nowhere in the bible will you probably find the words thou shalt not live together before marriage or whatever and i think that's what makes it so challenging is because we don't see it in the bible we're like well you know who's to say it's wrong but if you really think about it this is something that's going to be easier for probably an outsider to give you perspective on than when you're in it yourself because you know you're just so overwhelmed with your desires to be living with each other that you just can't see past it but it's all about trying to honor god as much as you possibly can with your life and if you're living together how much more likely are you to fall into temptation of sexual sin yeah the bible doesn't say thou shalt not live together but it does say to flee from sexual temptation and if you are living together you are not fleeing yeah just put yourself in right in the midst of it you're kind of just like bathing in it you're like taking a sauna in that temptation does dressing modestly attract a guy that's a good question i actually think it can i would think it attracts the right kind of guy let's say that i think there's a way to dress modestly and classy at the same time and when you do that i think it's a great way to stand out ironically because you don't see that too often it seems like a big theme that i'm seeing in these questions is how to be content while you're single and i think you know i just kind of want to say this that being married or being in a very happy relationship it's not going to fix all your problems not even close like you're going to deal with it might add some problems yeah it might even amplify your issues so like i really the last thing i want to do is give off the impression that you have to be with somebody yeah like we're happier than you because you're not married you know yeah you can very well be happier or more content for more peace being single than you ever can being married you can that's very possible because you know paul even talks about how he wishes that more people would stay single like him because he can be more devoted to god and his relationship with god but he also says that if they can't control themselves they should marry for it is better to marry than to burn with passion yeah and you know when you're burning with passion i was burning with passion so i just want to say that you know it actually from what we read it almost sounds like it's better to be unmarried if you can handle that if you can and i think as long as you try to you strive for that while you are single it's only going to make your marriage better it's only going to make your marriage better but on the flip side if you are constantly holding on to this false hope that when you find the right person that they're going to solve all your issues and this void that you feel on the inside that's a recipe for disaster i wish that we were doing this singleness video and coming out with the idea that like we have a dating app for you guys i know like a christian dating app should we create a dating app we've talked about it i think that'll be so fun oh the ideas we could do if we had enough time but anyway i think that's a wrap right yeah i mean there was so many questions but hopefully the ones we got to were helpful to you guys yeah yeah um all right guys well that was our q a on singleness hope you got something out of it and don't forget go follow us on instagram if you haven't already because we've got a little surprise coming for you probably this week right probably yeah within the next two weeks it will be yeah yeah so in the meantime this is nate and sutton sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that was a q a on singleness what's up guys nate and sutton back again sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration and speaking of sowing seeds look what we have here yeah last video we told you guys we had some exciting news we were going to share on instagram so y'all are a little late to the party but this was the news we made this t-shirt that says sewing seeds on it that we're really excited where's my shirt yeah i feel like this is kind of for girls sorry guys kind of for girls i i love this design i'm waiting for mine you can get one well you said i couldn't get one because it's a girl's shirt i just think it looks better for girls all right well i'll be wearing one in our next video so i wanted to show you guys how the shirt fit some people were asking i'm wearing a medium and it's kind of long as you can see which is nice because you can wear it with leggings in our picture i had it tied up like this so that's also an option which is nice this long because you can do that it comes in four different colors and this brand is comfort colors which i'm obsessed with comfort colors t-shirts because they're the kind that just get softer and softer like the more that you wash them so when we were looking for someone to make these shirts i was specifically looking for someone who sold comfort colors so they're really comfortable here's a little design up close you always hear us at the end of our video saying our tagline which is sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and we kind of wanted to share with you guys what that means and the heart behind our channel and the reason we made this shirt is all is because it's all about sowing seeds what is sowing seeds yeah so there's a parable in mark about sowing seeds i'm sure a lot of you guys have heard it before it's about the farmer who goes out he's spreading his seas everywhere some of them land on the path the birds come and eat them up some land on rocky ground where there's not enough room for them to root so the sun comes out and it scorches them some lands among thorns the thorns choke the seeds or the plants and then the last one is that it falls on good soil and it reproduces it says 30 60 to 100 fold and that's related to us in our lives and the good the seeds that fall in the good soil is you know we our purpose behind this channel is to sow seeds to uh the seed is supposed to be the word of god that's the relation to the seed so we're trying to sow those and in hopes that we are going to impact other people's lives and then they're going to go and impact other people's lives so that's where like the 30 60 100 fold comes from is like we're you know trying to do our part here and then giving the seed to other people and they're gonna do their part it's just gonna spread like wildfire yes and it's not just us doing this on our channel but also we hope to inspire you guys to do that as well and it's really a very cool concept if you think about it because our purpose here on earth is to sow seeds to go out tell people the good news about jesus and it's not our responsibility for the seed to grow you know that is where god comes in god brings the increase we are very limited in our power we can't make someone believe in jesus we can't make someone get saved god does all of that but it is our job god has designed it in such a way where it's our job he has given us the privilege of sowing the seeds out in the world and whatever that could look like a number of different things yeah i used to feel so much pressure on myself like when i heard of like sowing seeds i'm like oh if i talk to this person they're not a believer like i gotta make them believe somehow and i don't know what to say but god takes that pressure off of us it's not our job to grow the seed it's just our job to plant it and that could look like a number of different things you know that could mean telling someone about jesus that's sowing a seed and they may not believe right then there in that moment that what you're trying to tell them is true but you got to realize that you just planted a seed whether it might hit them later yeah whether they believe it or not and then another person might come along later that god uses to water that seed you know put some fertilizer on that thing and then it might grow into a sprout and um or sowing a seed might just mean praying over somebody that could be sowing a seed or what are some other examples of sowing seeds maybe like living your lives for god sometimes i feel like that's the best way to witness to someone is just walking the walk talk in the talk yeah people watch you and they see you and they're like wow i want what they have you know and what we have is jesus yeah and the way you speak to your spouse the way you treat your children the way you love your neighbor that can all be planting seeds in the name of jesus there's so many different ways to sow seeds in this life and we thought what better way to just be a cool little reminder than to wear a shirt that i don't have on where's my shirt so girls you are the lucky ones we're going to be coming out with something for the guys because you know because he has not shut up about it but i have had this idea of like making a t-shirt for months now i put on instagram that i drew this little design i've had it in my desk drawer for probably like eight months and we never did anything with it we just felt like we didn't have the time just too much going on and the other day i found it i pulled out that piece of paper and i was like i want to make this shirt and so he's like well then why don't you do it so we found this girl i found her through etsy her etsy page is called cutting creative and she's really great so if you guys go to her page to look at this shirt be sure to check out the other shirts that she has because she's super talented and that's why we chose her all right i can't believe we just shot that whole video and we didn't even tell you how to get the shirt we decided to turn the camera back on to add this in yeah so like we said there's four colors we're gonna put a link in the description below and that's where you can click to pre-order yours and don't we have a little extra something coming this fall yeah but we're gonna say it okay we're not gonna say it another cool thing about it uh so we didn't really know how people would respond to these shirts sutton put out we put out an order of a hundred shirts available for sale and then sutton was kind of worried that like one of her sisters were the only people to buy the shirts my sister said they would buy one i was like y'all might be my only customers but little did she know they sold out within hours which is pretty cool so so thank you guys to everyone who bought one thank you for the support that was really special i was so excited we were like we couldn't believe it yeah so now we're putting out a pre-order for the shirts because the hundred that were available are now gone um so now you can get yours it's kind of just like you're signing up for one basically it's just gonna take a little bit longer to get to you because she doesn't have the materials yet but you'll get it speaking of sewing seeds you know i just love it so much because it really takes the pressure off of us that if you think about it like it's not my job to convince somebody that jesus is who he says he is or convince them that the way that we believe is the real way the truth it's literally your job is just to sow the seeds to be like a seed sewing machine everywhere you go i feel like this tagline like god gave him this tagline because but right when he started youtube he's like we need to say something at the end of our videos this is what we should say and just like came out with it so fast and later i was thinking i was like that's like really good and i was wondering how long he thought about that but he acted like he didn't really think about it at all every good gift comes from above james 117. for those of you that followed along our abc bible verse challenge so i can't take credit for that um but anyway i would love to hear how some of you guys sow seeds what are ways that you also seeds in your everyday life comment below so we thought that this shirt would be a good reminder to you as you're wearing it too keep in mind that that's our job here on earth is to sew the seeds so as you wear it do it yeah that's great as you wear this shirt for those of you that get the shirt when you wear it make it make it a little bit of a challenge that when i wear this shirt i'm going to be sewing seeds i'm going to look for opportunities to sow seeds out there so there you have it now you know what our tagline means i don't think we've ever really explained it did we no it just sounded kind of cool but it also has a cool meaning but there you have it all right let's say it there we are this is nate and sutton sewing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that was the explanation of what is sowing seeds what's up guys nate and sutton back with another video and today we are talking about everything you need to know before you get married most of you guys know we are wedding videographers as a profession and so we've been to so many weddings and along the way we've learned so many things about how to make your day run as smooth and easy as possible so we've been a part of about three to four hundred weddings i would say and we travel so if you don't live here it's okay yeah we've been to the bahamas we've been to greece all over the united states our wedding company is called wed flicks we're on youtube instagram check us out tip number one this is a big one to me tip number one is to if you can have everything at one location a lot of times we're filming weddings we go to getting ready then we go to the ceremony then we go to pictures somewhere else between the ceremony reception then the reception then another spot for pictures and it's like if you're paying for your vendors like your photographer and videographer may be some of your most expensive vendors i would say and if you're if you want the most out of their time do everything at one location because every minute that they're driving to and from other places you're paying for it and not only getting the most out of your vendor's time but also getting the most out of your time your day is going to be so much more enjoyable and relaxed if you don't have to worry about getting all your stuff and moving from one location to the next location so many opportunities for things to get left behind we've been to so many ways like oh we left the rings and like someone has to go back and get them yeah no matter how great you are at planning your wedding it just weddings have a way of being stressful already so anything that you can do to cut back on that stress to give yourself more time it's gonna make your day so much more enjoyable our next tip would be to say your own vows to write your own personalized vowels huge yeah this is it's so i think a lot of couples this intimidates a lot of couples because they think they're going to get emotional and they're not going to go get through it but that's what makes it beautiful it's special yeah and special especially for the video i mean we love we love that stuff we're a little biased yeah but if you want and it makes not only the ceremony that much more meaningful to you the bride in the groom but also to your guests everyone has heard their traditional wedding ceremony vows you know endless amounts of times i also feel like there's no heart in just like repeating someone else's words like they're just telling you what to say and you're just word vomiting back what they tell you to say yeah so it's special to like write down your own feelings like your own promises to each other like the promises that you're making and it's just really special don't be scared to cry yeah me and sutton we were crying babies on our wedding day but as i met you and got to know you and see you standing here in front of me it all makes perfect sense you're the man i've prayed for my entire life for god to protect you keep you prayer i'll give you wisdom and strength build your character and to prepare you for me as he was preparing me for you   but we have our vows written on our in frame on our walls right now is that meaningful to us another thing that a lot of you guys may not think of is for the bride to get her hair and makeup done a little bit earlier in the day it's the most typical thing for the bride to be lash she wants her hair makeup to be the most fresh that it can be but for photo and video purposes is really important for you to be done earlier in the day because if like for us we do interviews with the bride and a lot of times she'll cry or get emotional reading her letter or something like that if she gets her hair and makeup done earlier her makeup artist is still there to fix anything that happened but if she goes last not only are you crunched for time but then no one's there to fix anything that happened and i'm telling you 90 plus percent of the time hair and makeup runs late so if you're the last one to go like i think it's a hundred percent like every single day yeah it's been very few times that it's actually ran on time so if you're the last one to go well everything is gonna be pushed back because everyone's waiting on you to get dressed and get your photos and everything so um yeah so let your bridesmaids and stuff go after you because people usually aren't waiting on them like they can kind of be ready whenever but like you're the most important part of the day obviously so you gotta be ready so this one we are very biased but we would highly suggest booking photo and video together if possible if you can find someone who does both of them great which is hard to come by but hey we do it we get the job done but if you can find a company that does photo and video together it's really really good because they know how to work synergistically together they've worked together many times before they know how to just get the shots done that they need to get and work together where a lot of the times the photographers and videographers seem to kind of clash on a wedding day because they each have their own agenda in mind and the shots that they want to get so if they're working against each other you're not going to get the most out of your photos and video but if you can find a company who does it together hashtag webflix um you're going to get the most bang for your buck not only that but you're going to save money like a lot i know that we when you book put on video together it's a discount so i'm sure other companies out there if you want to go local they would have a discount if you booked them together another tip this was kind of random but something that we kind of get aggravated about on wedding days is like when people are stressing about rain because weather is something that you can't control so like looking at it constantly is not going to change anything and on our wedding day personally it poured down rain all day long maybe we could put a clip in here of how hard it was raining on our day and it was fine like we were just not stressing about it we're like hey we're going to be married it's fine and our indoor option was no good and so we were like determined to get married outside so it stopped we got a little window 30 minutes we wiped the chairs off and did it outside yeah and we've done tons of weddings that it has rained and a lot of times they can turn out to be like some of our coolest weddings just because it's so unique you know you can get some really cool creative shots a lot of times the clouds are looking really cool and i think it just kind of goes back to really remembering what the day's all about you know if you're really that worried and that i know i know you want beautiful pictures and you want it to be sunny and everything but after all at the end of the day what matters most is that you're getting married to the person that you love and that is what matters so keep your attention on that and speaking of rain if it does rain on your wedding day one of the coolest things that you can do is have your maid of honor or best man or somebody the coordinator to bottle that rain i wish we would have done that yeah it would have had so much i know it it's so cool to have the rain and it's a memory you know that you can look back at 10 souvenirs souvenir 10 20 50 years from now knowing that's the rain that was on your wedding day so if it does rain bottle it up and if you're ever at a wedding you should do this as a gift to your friend like if your friend is the bride it would be a great gift like you know just set a cup out there and then a little bit later go get it and after the wedding give it to her i think that's really special the next big tip and this is really important if you're if you want to get good photos and video and that is to not save the best lighting of the day for family photos so so many of the times what we see is the couple gets married the sun is setting especially it kind of depends on what time of year you're getting married this is especially true in the fall and winter the sun starts setting it's looking so beautiful and gorgeous outside but they're taking family photos and by the time they get to the couple all we want to do is like pull the couple away and like just get them together i know by the it's called golden hour for a reason it looks absolutely stunning on photo and video so what your photographer videographer should know the best lighting of the day for photos and video so take their lead on this but keep in mind if the sun is setting and you only have 15 minutes of good daylight left for a couple photos get your couple portraits in and then you can always do family photos inside with a flash you're doing the pitch darkness who cares like you're never gonna look at those pictures never but the ones of you and you two together are gonna be the ones on your walls and in your frames for the rest of your life so this is so important it's we've been to so many weddings where like the sun is setting we're like oh my goodness come on they're taking photos with their dog right now or with their far distant uncle that they've met one time another random tip that i wish i would have thought of on my wedding day is to have a specific bottle of perfume for that day i wish that i would have bought a bottle of perfume that i only use on my wedding day because i don't know about you guys but for me my biggest memory trigger is a smell and when i smell something it just like instantly brings me back to wherever i first smelt that smell and i wish i i wish i would have done that with perfume so guys if you're looking for your bride a gift that would be a great gift idea or girls if you're watching just do it for yourself and not only that you can save it for like special occasions you know that special date night so when you put that perfume on your groom is like thinking of the wedding night yeah it's not only gonna bring you back but when he smells it i'm sure he'll do it for him too yeah so our next big tip is we strongly suggest either having a coordinator or somebody that is in charge of the day someone who's directing people telling people what to do especially if you're having like a lower end budget wedding i know a lot of times people skip out on a coordinator we did yeah we did which is fine but make sure you have someone that you feel confident in that they are going to take charge they're going to tell people what to do because it really helps to have someone like that on the day of because if you don't it's going to get messy yeah we would also suggest going along with that is having like a designated question answer because on your day there are so many questions coming at you and it bothers me so bad when i'm like watching the bride and everyone is coming up to her like asking her questions that she doesn't know the answer to and i feel like all they're doing is like stressing her out so brides if you're watching this tell your maid of honor like hey you're going to answer all the questions like any and then if they come to you be like ask her like that's all you have to say just ask her and then you don't have to stress or worry about anything you just relax and we'll end with this so our final tip for your wedding day is to soak it in yes just take it slow and pay attention to everything like i remember doing that on our wedding day i was like looking at everything like trying to commit it to memory and make the day just feel slow but when you're all rushing around all day long it's very stressful yeah it's it's so easy to get caught up on the little details of the day because you know your wedding day is such a big deal especially if you know you're someone who's dreamt about it your entire life you can get caught up on such little details like i've seen brides get so worked up because someone forgot their tie or like one of the buttons was missing on the groomsman shirt or something like that that is just so okay it's so silly remember the meaning of the day whether it's rain or shine whether everything goes according to plan or not if you're getting married that's what matters that's what counts and we want you to enjoy your wedding day all right guys hope you enjoyed that video hope these tips were something that you can take away to really enjoy your wedding day that much more but in the meantime this is nate and sutton sewing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that was everything you need to know for your wedding day you what's up

we're rolling rolling halsey pay attention all right here we go what's up guys nate and sutton back with another video and today we're coming for all of our new parents out there it's a hard time in life it's a good time but it's hard yes very true because i'm telling you what if you know your baby's not sleeping you know you're living the hard life all right this is baby halsen everybody say hey baby halston he's so cute chubby looking i sleep all the way through the night and make my parents really happy and we're here to hopefully help you make it easier yes so we quickly discovered after having our two boys this is halston our second one he's a little over three months old right now that sleep is essential your baby's sleeping is directly correlated with the happiness that you're experiencing in your life and directly correlated with your sleep if they're not sleeping you're not sleeping yeah so we thought it was very important we wanted to we've been wanting to make this video ever since oakland was two months old because we felt like we have discovered the secret on how to get your baby to sleep through the night and just as a disclaimer before we get into all the details of this video we got to make the disclaimer that there's many ways to get your babies to sleep through the night i'm sure but this has worked amazing not only for us but for so many of our friends and family people that we know there is a method to this and we're gonna give you that method at two months old oakland our oldest he's now almost two years old he was sleeping 12 hours through the night and then now halston at two months old he was sleeping at 12 hours through the night he just threw up all over me oh my gosh oh we haven't figured out the solution to throwing up yet man if you could figure that out let me know oh my goodness that's why i brought this rag in here so halston's a little over three months old right now but ever since he was two months old he was sleeping 12 hours through the night yeah and that's really something i see moms all the time on instagram posting like my baby's up all night does anyone have any suggestions or they're like talking about their nighttime feedings i'm like wow you guys are living the hard life and their babies are like nine months old so we're here to help you get it get it right from the beginning so you can get your sleep and be the best parents you can be yes so how did we do it how did we get both of our boys at two months old to sleep through the night well what was the biggest thing you would say that we did a schedule babies love routine and they learn it so as if you keep doing the same thing over and over they start to understand what is happening when and it eliminates a lot of crime yeah and schedules work really well for parents who are on a schedule if you're like totally us yeah which is totally us if you are like all over the place and you don't even know what your days are looking like schedule might not work the best for you but if you are living the routine life we i tell you what yes so a schedule is huge doing the same thing every day at the same time your baby will love that variety is a spice of life but i'm telling you when you have a newborn your ultimate goal in life is to get them to sleep and the schedule will do that yeah we love to sleep so we're like what can we do yeah so we'll we'll touch on that in a little more detail at the end of this video so now we're gonna go into some tips to help you guys get your baby to sleep through the night one of the tips is to have awake time for your baby during the day a lot of newborns like to sleep all day and they will if you let them they'll just sleep and sleep and you just wake up to feed them but you need to wake them up they need to be awake a certain amount of time during the day so you can get out their energy and sleep better at night and for their naps and speaking of getting out energy one of our favorite ways that we were able to let them get out their energy is tummy time it's not my favorite way it's hard to watch yeah they don't like that yeah a lot of parents have a hard time doing this because they're most babies don't like being put on their stomach they will cry and cry but it's so good for them it helps strengthen their neck muscles it helps them move around get a lot of energy out you just have to do it for just like 10 minutes not much yeah it really helps them learn how to hold their head up so tip number two is letting them get hungry for the last meal of the day how do you do that how do you make them hungry the last meal of the day well one of the best things that you can do is make sure you're not like giving them snacks or like cluster feeding right before night time you want to be hungry for that last meal so make sure there's at least a few hours between their last meal and then the previous feeding so they're really hungry they're going to be satiated that last meal and sleep through the night okay so those were some daytime tips now we're going to go into some night time tips which i think are the most important so what you're trying to do is get him to sleep through the night the first thing is creating a good sleep environment you want your room to be total darkness no night lights nothing stimulating no we have nothing in the crib no like mobile hanging above the crib no toys no blankets just boring because that's the idea is you want them to associate their crib with sleeping not playing not playing with their blanket or anything just you they're in the crib they go to sleep all right next thing is when your baby's a newborn and they're still waking up in the night to feed you want to get out of the sleep environment for the feeding time so when you go in their room or if they're in your room you want to turn the light on you want to turn the white noise off because you don't want them to associate feeding with sleeping it's like time to feed so you stimulate them with the lights feed them and then when it's time to go back to sleep put them back in the crib lights off sound machine back on all right another big tip is to put your baby in the crib while they're awake so when they're putting when you're putting them to bed to go to sleep you want to lay them down when they're awake not fully awake not like wide-eyed but like in that sleepy state where their eyes are like open and close and really slow they're tired so you know they're about to fall asleep put them in there so that way they'll fall asleep on their own and then eventually you'll lead up to the point where you're putting them in there fully awake fully alert like with oakland we are like playing with him making him crack a blapping running around his room right before he put him in his crib and he's still fine and he goes right to sleep because if you don't do that if you rock your baby to sleep and then put them in their crib you are training them to need you to fall asleep and that's not what you want you want them to fall asleep on their own and i know it's such sweet moments to rock your baby to sleep i know but if you want sleep you got to put them in there awake you got to do it another thing that's very important who's passionate about this one yeah is when your baby starts crying never go in there i don't care if they're one day old or they're two weeks old let them cry it out for hours and hours and hours you bet people are pausing and scrolling down commenting right now you're joking i'm just joking there is some truth to that but not to that extreme when your baby starts crying it's you know a mother's intuition a parent's intuition to run in there and save the day save the day soothe them make sure everything's okay but it's you're only hindering them by doing that and we're not saying don't go in there at all yeah we're not saying don't go in there at all but you set a time a time limit so there's an age limit where you start letting them cry when you don't respond immediately i think it's about 12 weeks where you do you start with five five five so it's five minutes five minutes five minutes in between the crying so when they cry you go in their room you don't turn on the light you don't make eye contact with them because that's stimulating you don't talk to them you just put their hand your tan on their chest pat their chest just let them know like you're still here you didn't go anywhere and then leave the room start the timer again if they start crying for five minutes and it is so hard it is so hard to not go in there because all you want to do is go help them but you're hindering yourself and you're hindering them if you do it if you respond immediately you're just look at his bald spot if you do it immediately you're just messing you both up so you gotta you gotta do it if it means putting in your headphones do that if it means putting earplugs do that okay so the next tip is letting them sleep as long as the doctor says it's okay so a lot of people think and you'll even read about this online where it's like oh you can only let your baby go three hours or four hours without feedings throughout the night but as long as they're gaining weight and they're healthy and the doctor says it's okay like our doctor you know he he was gaining weight week after week but he just wanted to keep sleeping through the night but we were waking him up which is just crazy and it was the hardest thing like he's sleeping and all i want to do is sleep i'm like well i gotta wake him up yeah but if your doctor says it's okay for him to keep sleeping he's gaining weight he's looking healthy she he then let him sleep earlier in this video i mentioned that uh how important a schedule is well what kind of schedule you might be asking how do i know what my schedule is and that's what we were like when we had oakland we weren't really sure where to begin and that is where a book saved the day you guys follow us you know we talk about this book all the time and i will i will preach about this book probably so the day i die because it's been so helpful and the book is moms on call this book is incredible we tell everyone we know about it we were gonna make a video about this regardless but we reached out to moms on call and asked him like hey guys we love your book we said we loved your book it's helped us so much is there anything that you can do for our subscribers and they said that they would offer us a discount code for our followers a 20 discount code on all their courses which is really cool because even though there was courses i know so we all we went off of was these books they have the zero to six months the six to 15 months and the 15 months to four years old and it covers way more than a schedule it's like everything you need to know how to give it back how to wash their hair what do you do if their nose is running what do you do if they have a fever like literally everything that comes with being parents is in that book if you don't know what to do which was us just get the book yeah so these books have been amazing for us and we have we have a we'll put a link down in the description below so you can go and check them out if you're interested um but if you're more if you're less of a reader and more of like a visual type of video person like i am you might find the course is really helpful and the courses go into even more depth than the books and they but they go hand in hand originally when we were getting it i was a little nervous and like i don't really like to read like non-fiction factual books i don't know how i'm going to read this book but it's not set up like a book that you have to read the whole thing there's a table of contents and it tells you every single thing so we're like okay we're about to give him his first bath what do we do like in the front it says bathing and so you flip to that page like it's not really a book that you read through it's kind of just like a manual that you you know find what you need and look it look for it in there yeah so this has been and the schedule they tell you exactly what to do every hour of the day every at every stage of their life from one week old to four years old if you're interested go check out the link below you can find them on there and find their courses the our code nate and sutton is 20 off on only the courses but the link below will give you all the access to all of their books and courses and everything and i know you guys want to see more of our kids but this is why we don't do videos with them it's because we get thrown up on a million times it is challenging to do videos with little babies and toddlers i tell you yeah it's very hard but anyway that's it for now that is how we have been able to get our kids to sleep through the night it's been a game changer i hope those tips helped y'all and that you get better night sleep because of it yes everyone loves to sleep oday we want to talk about something that we are guilty of and i think if we're honest with ourselves most of us are guilty of this from time to time and what we are guilty of is getting so caught up in the things of this world running striving toiling working so hard to achieve things that are worldly that just don't matter and we neglect the most important thing of all which is our relationship with god it's the world that we live in it's like the moment you were born everyone is pushing you to do more be more it's like from the time we were a baby we're being pushed to crawl before everyone else talk before everyone else get in the best schools everywhere you go you're being pushed to do more be more and if you aren't keeping up they push you harder and harder trying to get you into the best schools the best universities that you can get the best job constantly running faster and faster and trying to be better than everybody else if you look around it's like everyone is too busy for anything everyone's running so fast that they're so exhausted all the time that they have no time for anybody else they just keep running and running and a lot of us don't even know why we are running in the first place why are we pushing ourselves so hard to make more money so that we can buy a nicer car buy a nicer house because that's going to make us happier and we're not saying hard work is a bad thing definitely not hard work is a great thing our church this past sunday said that you do not find your purpose in your job but that's where you fulfill it so it is a great thing to be working hard at that job but working so hard and running so fast causes us to not be able to follow the verse in the bible psalm 46 10 that says be still and know that i am god it is so hard in today's time to just be still when we have literally the world at our fingertips with the phone in our hand we have tvs we have friends we have families to keep up with we have jobs to work so it can be really hard to just do that one thing of just be still we live in a world of efficiency and achievement and the thought of just sitting still and doing nothing how many of us tell ourselves that we just don't have time for that because we think if we slow down we're not going to accomplish our goals and other people are going to pass us and we just keep going and going and the problem with this is that god has created us to be relational beings he wants to have a relationship with us and this demands our energy it demands our hearts and it demands our time when god made adam and eve it says that he was walking in the garden with them jesus said abide in me and i in you and this is what we were designed for what we were created for is to have a relationship and a deep connection with our savior if you know the story adam and eve ran off they wanted to do their own thing they wanted independence which is the exact temptation that all of us face today is to just do our own thing we want to be independent and control our lives we don't want to sit still and spend time getting to know god and being intimate with him because we have things to do it reminds me in james 4 13-16 where it says now listen you who say today or tomorrow we're going to go to this or that city spend a year there carry on business and make money why you do not even know what will happen tomorrow what is your life you are a mist that appears for a little while and vanishes instead you ought to say if it is the lord's will we will live and do this or that as it is you boast in your arrogant schemes all such boasting is evil that's how god describes our life it's like a vapor it's there and then it's gone you have no idea what the next hour holds even when you think you're in control of your life you're not and what's really amazing to think about is that god wants and desires a relationship with us james 4 5 tells us that god yearns jealously over the spirit he made to dwell in us that when i heard that verse that just brought tears to my eyes like god yearns jealously for me for him for you like it's just incredible to think about that the god that sits on a throne in heaven surrounded by hundreds of thousands of angels worshipping him just unapproachable like light coming out of him and thunder and and like that being who wants to know me like wants to know you i just i can't to me that's like the most powerful image i've ever thought of and i think that's like really special and really something i want you guys to get in your mind that god wants a relationship with you and he desires that with you and that is just something to be so cherished and not taken lightly spend that time with him get in the word listen to him speak to you because he has things to say to you and he wants your time he wants your attention i think that the message that god gave to the church in ephesus is the same message that he's giving to the church today in revelation 2. he tells them that they are doing so many good things but they have forsaken their first love and that they need to change and repent or else he will remove their lampstand in other words he would rather not even have his church doing all of these great things and not loving him he wants our love he wants our hearts and then there is what could be the most frightening passage of all which comes from matthew 7 and he says that people will come to his throne and say lord lord didn't i do this didn't i do that and he will say depart from me i never knew you yes so it's not about what you do it's about knowing him and loving him we are living in no better time than now to wake up and return to our first love a time of quarantine and isolation make the most of this opportunity to start growing your relationship with god the one that decides whether or not you keep breathing for the rest of today he wants you he wants your love he wants your heart it's a very bold decision to look to him and say no i've got better things to do when we say to be still we're not saying to sit around and do nothing all day god has called us to do good work and that's what we need to do but he has not called us to do that work so much and so hard that it takes away our relationship with him in the time that we could spend with him god wants you to have so much security in him that's not dependent on how well you perform how much money you make how successful you are he wants you to be so secure that you no longer fear death or anything else so much joy so much peace is waiting on the other side of deep relationship with him there are so many things in our life that are outside of our control but something that is in our control is the decision that we make of whether or not we're gonna seek god in a relationship with him every single day it's your choice   on a lighter note coming in with some announcements yes so you may have noticed the hoodies that we are wearing or mine's a hoodie yours is what mine's a crew neck a crew neck these are our new sweatshirts and we finally got some for the guys yes

seeds and that's what our hope and prayer is for these shirts and these sweatshirts is every time you wear them it's just another reminder that that's our purpose on earth and everywhere we go we should be sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration an announcement number two is that speaking of sewing seeds of love we have started a new idea on our instagram and it is we are doing a christian bachelor ambassadorette we're gonna do it every week we're rotating between the guys and the girls this past week was our very first time we did three bachelors this coming week we're gonna do three bachelorettes so if you want in on that fun to meet and connect with like-minded people follow us on instagram at nate and sudden and oh it's fun it is fun we've been getting tons of messages and people are excited about this which i wish something like this was going on when before we met well maybe not because we wouldn't have met maybe but the idea is that it's so hard in today's world for christian singles to meet and find people that are compatible for them and that's what we're hoping to do is using our platform to help some of you guys meet some other amazing christian singles out there so join in on the fun we'll see you there what's up guys nathan sutton back with another video and today we are talking about how porn almost ended our relationship and how it probably ends a lot of people's relationships and how you can prevent it from ending your relationship this is a pretty taboo topic i feel like that most people don't talk about but yet so many people out there struggle with it so and especially since the demographic of our channel and our instagram is around our age like 18 to 30. we think this would the perfect video for that audience yeah and i think well i don't think i know this is such an issue such an issue for the christian community it's such an issue for just everybody in general and it's time we take it on it's time we figure out how do we resolve this addiction that men and women have to something that is so evil and brings so much destruction into people's lives yeah the thing is i don't even know if it's something that can be resolved like for a lot of people it might be something that is always there but what we're going to try to help you do in this video is to fight it it might be a fight every single day but we want to help you in the fight so what percentage of christian men and women do you think look at porn and we're not talking about like the people that are addicted that look at it multiple times a day but just the people that maybe see something look for a minute and then later feel regret and they're like oh i shouldn't have done that but then later they fall into it again it is 64 of men and 15 percent of women have admitted to looking at porn in that way and then if you get the demographic down to ages 18 to 30 the percentage of men jumps up to 79. so as we were saying this is obviously a big topic for christians for everyone in general so let's go for those of you who don't know so me and sutton in our early dating stages we basically started talking about porn and she was asking me if i've ever watched it and i had to tell her that i have and that i actually was pretty recently and this was many years ago and in that moment it was like i could see it just broke her heart right is that what you would say yeah because for me i had never experienced anything like that um so i just didn't understand the struggle and i also had like i asked him and he told me so i think it was hurtful in that way too but this was like probably like the fifth time we hung out we were getting deep conversations pretty quick but if i were to find out now i can imagine how much worse it would hurt like now that we're married and now that i have so much trust in him and i know him and that's some people out there that are finding this out about their husbands about their wives so it's really hard yeah and so for me it was something that i've always been so ashamed of like i knew it was wrong but it was like an addiction that i couldn't break and it wasn't until sutton when i saw what it did to her like how much it just hurt her knowing that that was something that i've done and that i did and that i do that it just that is what did it for me and and i think if i would have kept on watching porn do you think we would be together um yeah i don't know if we would be together like if i would have found out later on i mean married it would be different like i think i would obviously be willing to try to work through it um i might have been willing to work through it during our dating stages you know give them a chance obviously because i feel just like it's such an addiction that even if i don't understand it it is and so i think we would have tried to work through it but if you would have continued doing it that early on after we talked about it then probably not yeah and i think i could see that in her i was like wow this impacts her so much and it really just opened up my eyes to how dark it is because when you're doing it by yourself and you feel like you're not really hurting anyone what's the harm it can be easy to lie to yourself and be like it's not really hurting anyone but when i saw what it did to her that's really what i haven't looked at it since and that was like five years ago we actually recently had a comment on our other video that we did about porn just the other day that's kind of sparked this idea was a guy saying like if i'm single who am i hurting like i'm by myself watching this who am i hurting but there's just that's such a loaded question it was so many answers of who you're hurting and it's not no one i'll just say that but we can get into the video now for us it kind of goes without saying that looking at porn is wrong but that may not be that obvious to some of you so you know real quickly we'll talk about how jesus said whoever looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart i mean think about that that's like a powerful statement committing adultery with this woman that you are lusting after so every time you look at porn you are committing adultery with all of those women so these are things that jesus takes very seriously and so should we and it's even one of the ten commandments thou shalt not commit adultery so you can see what a serious matter this is so it's not enough to just realize okay looking at porn is wrong it's something that i don't want to do and i'm going to stop it's not enough to just say that and try to motivate yourself you have to have a battle plan you have to come up with a strategic way to overcome it so we know that there is someone in the bible who has this kind of story that relates to this topic and that is david there are 929 verses in the bible about king david but yet a lot of us remember him by what happened in only three of them so in the story david is supposed to be going off to battle but he decides to stay back he's confident he's like oh they got it i'm just going to stay back and then that's where we're going to pick up right here i'm going to read some of this in second samuel 11 2 it says one evening david got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace from the roof he saw a woman bathing the woman was very beautiful and david sent someone to find out about her the man said she's bathsheba the daughter of ilium the wife of uriah the hittite then david sent messengers to get her she came to him and he slept with her and then the rest of the story is about her getting pregnant and then like this indescribable pain for david and living in deceit because this actually was his friend's wife and all these things so what we see with david is the same thing that we all see in a lot of other people's lives maybe even in our own life david was not somewhere that he was supposed to be he saw something he wasn't supposed to see which led him to do something that he wasn't supposed to do and how many of us can relate to that when it comes to porn you know maybe you're alone at night and it's on tv or you're flipping through the channels like whatever it is that gets to you david put himself in that situation back in that day it was a thing for women to bathe you know outside so by going on the roof of the palace to get this view he he knew that he was like putting himself in a position where he could potentially see something that he's not supposed to see yeah and by having a battle plan and we're going to get to that here in a few minutes but you have to come up with a plan because satan is so sneaky how he tempts you to go places that you don't want to go you know it might for me it was like starting off just on social media or something and then you see someone in a bikini and it's like oh well looking at a girl in bikini that's not bad and then it leads into something else and then it's like oh well if i've already looked at this then i might as well look at this and now since i've looked at it i can just look at it all i want you know it's just like this snowball effect that you have to cut it off way before it even begins and i think a lot of us tell ourselves the lies that oh well when i get married this will go away i'll just do this till i'm married and then i'll be able to have sex all i want and then it will just go away and then what happens is a lot of you find that that's not true that's not the case you carry this wound with you you carry this addiction into your marriage and then things just get so much worse but it's taking away more than just i mean the fact that you think you're gonna have sex all this time and it's just gonna fix it it's not going to fix it first of all and second of all it also distorts your view of what sex is like like you're watching these things that aren't necessarily real or reactions that aren't real and then you bring that into your marriage and to your wife or to your husband and expect it to go in that way or whatever you've seen and it does it and it might be this big disappointment porn is like a school that you're going to every time you watch porn just know that you're going to school because you're training yourself you're teaching yourself to go to one woman after the next one moment after the next and it's just like this immediate gratification and it's like oh let's go to the next one and then you're looking at fake women they're either photoshopped they're plastic surgeried up that you're not even looking at an accurate picture of what they probably even look like in real life and then you bring that into your marriage so it's like you're training your mind all these horrible habits a warrior is most vulnerable when they are overly confident it's one of our bible verses where there is pride then comes disgrace but with humility comes wisdom so you always need to realize that you're vulnerable and even me like i haven't looked at porn in over five years but i need to realize that i am still vulnerable satan will tempt me any chance that he gets so that means that i need to come up with a battle plan everyone needs to come up with a battle plan and like david he was overly confident and what happened to him he fell we are always potentially vulnerable so through the process we need to be honest and wise with ourselves we need to know that satan is going to be setting up some land mines to trip us up to mess us up and we need to be honest to ourselves about where we are most vulnerable and then wise enough to stay away from those situations like for you is it when you're scrolling through social media and you see someone in a bikini or girls if you see a guy in a bathing suit is it when it's late at night and you're scrolling through the channels on the tv and you see something you're not supposed to see is it when your spouse is asleep and you walk off on your own you know what is it for you and whatever it is be wise enough to stay out of that situation for part of your battle plan it's very important to put safeguards in your life that are going to help prevent you from falling into temptation when satan attacks you so whatever that looks like whether that is not being alone with the opposite sex that's one thing that me and sutton really try to do or putting blocks on your cell phone or your computer to prevent you from going to certain websites with passwords that you don't know whatever it looks like for you find out where the beginning of temptation arises and find a way to prevent yourself from going there you got to start five ten steps ahead you know you can't wait till you're faced oh with a naked person in front of you you need to find a way to prevent yourself from getting way ahead of that yeah i was watching a pastor speak about this topic and he was saying that he has all these blocks on his devices and his password that he doesn't know the password and he has a few people that do know it he can't download apps without someone's help and i'm just thinking like man are you really that weak you know is it really that easy to fall into it and he actually answered my question i guess he knew people were thinking that about him and he was like no i'm not weak i'm not that weak right now but you never know like what if i go on a business trip and i'm in a hotel alone like what am i gonna do i don't know he's like i have no plans to do anything but like why not why wouldn't i prevent myself now from doing something that i could fall into in the future and i think that's a great idea like even if you don't think you have a problem even if this has never even come up for you this might be a good idea of something to do because you never know what could happen one day so there's so much that i think we all know that is bad wrong just horrible about looking at porn it distorts the way you think it changes your relationships it's dishonoring to god and that's why it's so important to flee from it you know when the bible talks about sexual immorality it talks about fleeing like dude when i think about fleeing i think about just get me away from this you know whatever it takes yeah so in the bible it doesn't say to fight sexual temptation it says to flee from it so up until the point of fleeing we are fighting that's what we were talking about just a second ago of putting in this plan in place preventing yourself from getting to that point whatever it takes the blocks on your phone or whatever and then if it just so happens to come in front of you that's when you flee and also what we should be fighting for is purity i can't tell you how much freedom has come along with being done with that addiction it creates so much emotional distance it creates so much guilt and shame and i was i was so done with that and i think that's what we should be fighting for and realizing that this is this is the way this is the way that god wants us to live our lives he does not want us to live addicted to adultery addicted to sexual immorality so aren't you tired of that aren't you tired of trying to cover up your tracks and trying to figure and worrying about when they're gonna find out when they're gonna catch you okay so the battle plan what is it how can we use it to fight this evil of pornography so step number one is to confess your sins to god and that's what david did that's eventually what david how david got there confessing to god that i have messed up i've really messed up and i have an issue i have a problem i'm gonna humble myself and try to figure out a battle plan on how to fight this no matter how trapped you feel how dark of a place that you're in god is there to forgive you and to restore you and to give you strength and to support you in your battle plan if you think he already defeated satan so if you have him on your side i think you're in good hands step number two is to confess your sins to the right people james says confess your sins one to another so that you can pray for each other and be healed we are not meant to fight alone so if you have this problem tell somebody tell multiple people that are close to you so they can help you and they can pray for you and help you get through it step number three remove the triggers from your life whatever it is that's causing you to fall into temptation whether it's watching movies alone at night or scrolling through social media get rid of it don't be stupid get off the path of destruction number four is to get the necessary help that you need make the phone call go to rehab get counseling whatever it is whatever it takes to remove this from your life you got to do it step number five is to let god heal the wound let god restore you from this temptation and that's what he did for me and i know because i know it can be done it was something that i've struggled with for years ages from 12 to 22. i mean that's a long time that's something that i really struggled with and i felt like i could never shake it but god brought satan into my life and really showed me what kind of damage it was going to cause to her my future wife and that's what did it for me and god can do it for you but don't wait for someone to come into your life because we're here right now trying to tell you we're trying to prevent you from that situation yes yeah it's crazy to think back on what is it doing for you have you ever thought about that like what good does porn do for you nothing destruction really yeah destruction are we saying this is going to be an easy battle to win absolutely not this is going to be hard but through christ there is healing there is intimacy in marriage and those are the things that we want for you and we need to fight for and to the female warriors out there if you have a man in your life i'm talking to the girls because i'm a girl if you have a man in your life who confesses this to you comes to you and says that he has a problem he's been doing this i know you might look at them like you're disgusted like you you feel like you're not enough you know why are they doing that why am i not fulfilling that for them you may get really angry and all of that is justified you have every right to feel that way but i encourage you to try your best to not look at them as someone that is gross or someone that's perverted or anything like that but instead look at them as someone that's wounded and someone that trusts you they're coming to you you know for help and they trust you to help them and be with them through this and be that prayer partner be that person on the battlefield that's fighting with them because they they need it you know like we said before we're not meant to fight alone so don't make them fight alone and i think a lie that satan will tell you that he told me is that it's something that you will never overcome you might think if this is an addiction that i just i've tried so long that i can't i can't shake it but that is not the truth i'm telling you today that that is a lie from satan and your mind will always be a battlefield but you are its commander not its slave and we're here today to bring the good news to you that you have the power through christ to overcome these these temptations and we're here to help you do that we'll be praying for you guys and we hope this video was an encouragement to you and gave you a applicable battle plan for your life in the fight against pornography and if you're out there and you've been through this and you had your own battle plan that worked for you please leave it below share it with everyone else you know your way might work better than something that we've said um yeah and even though pornography is just one part of life i feel like satan uses it to just sneak into so many parts of our lives you know it is destructive to relationships to marriages which can be destructive to families it takes away the joy of the gift of sex you know that god you know god created sex he created marriage and sex within marriage and engaging with porn takes away what god intended it to be all right guys well this is nate and sutton sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that was your battle plan on how to fight pornography what's up guys nate and sutton back with another video and today we are exposing all of the most weird things about us which his list is about this long and might as well yeah i thought this was gonna be kind of a hard video to make because she's like the least weird person i've ever met but i was able to come up with some pretty good ones yeah so i wrote the weird things about him and he wrote them about me and we don't know what each other wrote so we're about to find out together all right who's up first ladies first okay so my first one you just know it off top of your head you don't have to look at your notes yeah first of all let me say this he's got so many weird things about him that i cannot say on camera i feel like the weirdest things i can think of about you could not be said so i'm coming out here with the bang because this one's borderline is that he does naked handstands every day when he's like going to get in the shower before he works out he's like doing a little warm-up kind of in the room before he showers and he'll like do handstands with no clothes on please don't visualize that i don't know if i can top that one um okay so one thing that's really weird about sutton is so in the she'll have these weird bad dreams about me that always get her going oh i had one last night i forgot to tell you what was it i wasn't thinking about it i just know i woke up so mad at you well the funny thing is is that she'll have dreams that are like bad about me where like i'm cheating on her like that happens all the time and or uh like i like dumped her or like did something bad to her and then she'll like be all excited about me like she like wants to get intimate are you serious yeah like i've never touched you because i'm like so mad not in the moment but then you'll like wake up and like you'll be so excited about me because i'm not really that person you know okay the second one is that he is the most routine person i've ever met like i could literally tell you what he is doing every single day probably to the minute because every he's like living a groundhog day if y'all see that movie just the same thing over and over and over but he loves it that's how he loves it i love it yeah including the handstands yeah sometimes i think like i am so routine to the max like even the way i dry off with a towel like i do it the same exact way every day um but hey that's who i am i know one of mine that you're gonna say is the only one i could think of for me i hope i got it i'll tell you when you get to it you'll get to it but i gotta say i gotta say about being routine it really makes you super productive for those of you that lack productivity we need some rules here what you can't fight every week i'm not fighting i just want to know i want them to know why i do it next weird thing about sutton is that she has never ever tasted beer or had a pb and jelly a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i think that's pretty weird yeah those are true and it is weird yeah but then not having beer one's kind of cool and i think peanut butter and jelly i just feel like i know i'm not gonna like it so at this point i just kind of feel like it's cool to say i'm 29 and i've never had something that pretty much probably everyone that's not allergic to peanut butter has had so i still haven't had one and don't want one all right another weird thing for him is that he y'all probably know this because he doesn't probably like every video but he says the wrong word for other words all the time and he got it truly because his dad is the exact same way you want to give him an example well i was trying to think of one i mean y'all have seen it because he's done it in every single video i'm always correcting you i always cut those out what when you correct me oh oh yeah and he did sayings wrong all the time along with that so you know the same like and span he'll say like and speed and then i've said something like well that girl she's a strange bird or something and he was trying to do that like later on he had never heard that saying but later on he was trying to do it and he's like man he was a strange fish okay so this one i think is pretty weird so every night we have dessert and sutton has like this thing where this is the one i knew you were gonna do she has she has to be watching the show while she's eating the dessert and if if the show's not going there's it's like a real problem like i can't even talk to her like like she'll get she'll serve us dessert and like i'm like man this is good she's like not saying anything um i'll be like asking questions but where did you get that how do you what do you think of this dessert and then should i can we just watch a show so it's like while she's enjoying her dessert she has to be watching the show because i look forward to that dessert all day and like when i get to that point i want maximum enjoyment all right next thing for nathaniel is that every night so like we said he's on his little routine so every night i go upstairs and brush my teeth and everything before he does and we'll like be sitting on the bed and then every night he comes up do you know where i'm going no he comes up and while he's brushing his teeth he will stand at the foot of the bed and just brush his teeth like staring at me and i and he doesn't say anything he's just staring at me like and i could not even be looking at him you know like looking at my phone or something and he just stares you should take that as a compliment because when i'm brushing my teeth i could be staring in the mirror i could just be staring out in space but why not have a good view that's what it says i'm like what are you doing because i would say that like all the time he's like just looking at the best thing in the room so speaking of weird one weird thing that me and sutton both do is a lot of times right before the video or right before the camera turns on we take our glasses off but for this video we got some cool glasses because these glasses are from felix gray thank you felix gray for sending us these glasses and sponsoring this video for those of you that may not know our devices such as our cell phone computers tvs they emit blue light which is very similar to like sunlight and it messes up your melatonin levels melatonin makes you sleep better so the idea is that by having a blue light blocking technology on your glasses it helps prevent that blue light from getting into your eyes and you don't have to have prescription glasses either they make it without prescriptions yeah the only blue blocker glasses i've ever seen are like the orange lenses y'all may have seen them and they look so goofy i was like i would never wear those but i would like something to block blue light i didn't know there was like regular glasses that could do that so i've noticed sleeping better personally have you oh yeah yeah another funny thing we do about our glasses is that we decide together whether or not we're going to wear them like whenever we're going somewhere like are you wearing your glasses and if one of us wears them we both wear them yeah many blue like blocking glasses that are out there don't filter enough blue light especially like in the range where it matters yeah so felix gray is different in the sense that they use their own proprietary lens technology that filters actually 15 times more blue light than the competition where it matters the most i've never worn blue light blocking glasses before so i didn't know if it was going to have any effect on me or not but i have noticed after going to bed at night i sleep better because as i'm looking at my phone at night that light is being blocked and so i've been feel like i've been sleeping deeper yeah and i've my prescription glasses that i currently had i had blue light blocking technology put on it so i was already a believer in it before because i spend so much time on my computer and phone working and whatnot but i have to say that i like these better because they they block out more blue light something that i really liked about this company is that we were able to get them completely online on their website they have different shapes of faces to tell you like which glasses are going to look best on you since you can't obviously try them on since they're online and they got us the right size the right prescription we went off of our face shape and i love them and my with my other glasses i literally went to the store i'm pretty sure four times because it kept they kept doing it wrong like it was crooked and then they were too tight and yeah it was a big headache but this one it was so nice they sent them in the mail and they were just like perfect yeah for both of us so that was pretty impressive so for those of you that are interested in checking out felix gray for your own nifty little blue light blocking prescription glasses or non-prescription uh we'll put our link in the description below so go check them out okay so back to our show um so i think this is probably the weirdest thing about sutton oh no and that is it's kind of disgusting too that is that she i would say is obsessed with popping my pimples what girl isn't man and so so much so that if i pop one on my own without letting her know she like gets mad about it she's like you didn't let me see those are only for the real big ones i know are gonna be good the big ones oh my gosh she says it like it's so normal watch the comments below people are gonna be like me too yeah and i know this is actually like a thing with girls in general that they love to just pop pimples on guys maybe girls too i don't know but wow well good thing i'm going gross for you too what do you mean your next one is a gross one oh my gosh well this is your last one way to end with a bang i started with the bang i'm ending with a bang is that he never admits to a toot oh my gosh in our entire relationship our entire marriage he will never say yep i did it sorry he's always like i didn't do that you're just you're just smelling things that wasn't me well it's true a lot of times you are just making up things i don't know if levi's sneaking in here or what now he's like the boy that cried wolf like if he were to be honest i would might believe him but now every time he says no which is every time i'm like oh you definitely did it she's just all it's all in her imagination he's still going even on camera okay you just did it right now did what you too no i did not you're just she's so full of crap i can't even tell you all right this one's not that i mean some of you might not find this that crazy but to me it's really weird because i'm like the complete opposite so she doesn't like bananas or berries who doesn't like bananas or berries those are like literally my two favorite foods ever every morning i make a smoothie full of bananas and berries and she doesn't like them you didn't end with a baby i know i didn't know the bang but that's because you're like so normal she's like the most normal person ever so i was really having to reach for some stuff but i thought i got some good stuff out of her we'll do a bonus one for sutton because just because because i'm not that weird yeah so she is uh she's like a little sleeping diva it's not good to be when you have kids if she doesn't get like a minimum of nine hours of sleep she acts like she's just exhausted it's not a minimum of nine now nine is eight and nine is my good number um but let me put out there that we go to bed at the same time and i get up first so what do you got to say about that first we have at the same time you may get out of bed first because you got a baby crying but we wake up at the same time not every day and except you get the naps and i work harder you could get hate for that one this is nate and sutton sewing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that was the weirdest things about us what's up guys what's up guys we are about to open up the vlog before we do we had an exciting announcement to make yes our exciting announcement is that if you guys watch one of our previous videos you know that we are in the market to be trying to build a house and we got some renderings drawn by we plan homes and they are amazing yes so they're actually creating a like virtual video of what our house is going to look like but he's like walk through it yeah before before it's even built which is really cool which we're excited to share with you guys which brings us to the point that we are in the market for a builder we live in georgia so for any of you okie i mean halsey i need my finger or any of you builders out there in georgia that want to build our house or if you know of a good builder send them our way contact us at nate and sutton gmail.com with the subject i want to build your house and we're looking for you that's the announcement for now let's get into the vlog what's up guys nathan sutton back with another video and today we are vlogging back finally with another video we've finally skipped on you guys for i think the past two weeks it's been a busy time of year for us you know we're in the wedding industry and everyone wants to get married in october which we're thankful but it just makes us very busy so where are we going today guys we're back we're back with some fun okay what you see he loves his books so we got cute baby number one baby number two good job he's getting his animal noises in anyway where where are we going today sutton we are going to the mountains to tennessee wow yeah so last year i decided that this is a tradition that i want to do i want every year for the fall i am like in love with the fall the leaves and here in georgia in the mountains up in tennessee it gets beautiful so the trick is hitting it at the right time we don't know if we're gonna hit it at the right time but we're giving it a shot so today's halloween oh yeah so we want to make it a tradition to start going up to the mountains every fall as a family and to enjoy the foliage the the beautiful colors let's talk about halloween we get asked a lot if we're gonna celebrate halloween or not and i'll tell you guys my thoughts on it i obviously think it's wrong to like the witches and the full moons and like decorate your house all scary and all that stuff i'm not for that but like as far as do you think it's wrong or you think they're just not for it you said it's definitely you said you think it's wrong that's a statement i was thinking gotta be careful what you say yeah i don't think it's wrong probably yeah it seems a little odd to me to be like like there's a person in our neighborhood that has like a dead girl on her porch you know something about that just seems a little odd to me but as far as like dressing them up in cute outfits where they get to one day to pretend to be something else and getting candy innocently i don't see a problem with that like a lot of things in life i do believe it's kind of like where your heart is where your intentions are on another note i don't really know how i feel about halloween part of me is like yeah you know you're just just dressing up being cute having fun but then another part of me is like are we celebrating satan's holiday so i don't know it's it's um last year we didn't do it this year we're not doing it so i'd rather just make it a tradition to go the mountains take a trip do something fun as a family because who needs candy anyway we might get him some candy should we give him some candy in our little cabin he's never had candy no he's never had it so anyway um we rented out a cute little cabin for the night with the jacuzzi oh you want to go in your jacuzzi anyway we're about to hit the road a little nervous about this car ride it's about three and a half hours with two babies we're leaving at nap times that's either a genius idea or like a horrible idea we'll see how it goes there they are you see them so far the car ride's going pretty good all these sleeping okay     all right guys we have made it this may look like an average river walk to you but to us it's serenity the drive it went great the first like two hours but that last hour and a half things were going downhill really fast we pulled into gatlinburg tennessee which by the way for any of you guys that are considering going to gatlinburg i never want to see that city again in my life we went right down over the mountain to another place called pigeon forge and this is what i'm talking about they have a nice calm river walk the reason that gatlinburg was so crazy is we were stuck in like traffic like you would not believe that was sleeping up until that point but as soon as our car stops he's just like that place was like an amusement park and it was just bumper-to-bumper traffic both of them were screaming and crying but now we found them to get in the back seat and those are the times that you just don't think to pull the camera out no this is why we came here he found his little treasures these two leaves right here is the whole reason we came to tennessee   ready where's the leaves three two one whoa look at the big pumpkin okay how do you feel about that   we made it this is nice look at this place wow smells so cavendishy look at this look at that view heck yeah   we're home you see that loft come on downstairs everything like what like our room i think oh really yeah check out the little downstairs area got two porches and there the jacuzzi is sudden you think we'll be getting that jacuzzi later i know jump good job okay look at all the toys they got for you here oh you see all the toys he's finally enjoying himself i think we could live here me and him we're back home we're back home right where we belong yeah the trip was fun it was uh short and intense would we do it again yeah it was you know we made some memories but i think we kind of walked away with the same lesson that we walked away with from our mexico trip no it couldn't be that bad of a lesson yeah it wasn't that bad but it was just traveling with kids with babies is hard i just think if we would have gone and stayed a little longer it would have been more worth it but you know we were just in and out like it was just one night um but they slept great and everything which is really nice but that car ride it got serious it was not that bad   it was but anyway we we didn't vlog as much as we were hoping to because it just seems so chaotic and busy with them yeah just traveling with kids just a lot there's a lot of things to bring a lot of things to remember trying to do their schedule a new location is not the easiest thing but me and nathanael love to travel so yeah we just need to hold our breath until our youngest is like three and then we're wide open yeah we have this dream of traveling with our kids but i think we're gonna have to wait a few years people do it but and you can do it it wasn't that hard but is it like the most convenient and enjoyable thing i would say probably not he's trying to suck his thumb with the bottle that's his new move he needs both of them at the same time all right guys well this is nate and sutton that was our vlog hope you enjoyed it we'll see you next time what's up guys nate and sutton back with another video and today we are talking about how to be a good wife no that's not it that's not it no what what is it how to walk like a light of place oh okay all right sorry let me try that again what's up guys nate and sutton back with another video and today we are talking about how to walk like a wife yes so this is for people in their single stage or even in your dating stage of how to walk like a wife even if you're not one we had posted a video of a tick tock on our instagram about this topic someone messaged us and asked us the question of what does this look like and what y'all's opinion like what does it look like to walk like a wife and we're like that's a great topic so we are going to answer that with our opinion yeah because us men out there we need you to be walking like a wife because we need to find this whole life and this also goes the other way around you know we could do a whole other video of like how to walk like a husband because i know the girls feel the exact same way of like they don't want a guy walking like a boyfriend they want someone walking like a husband but that's for another day today we're talking for the girls because that's what the video was about let's get into it okay the first thing this is just our opinion like i thought of the question how do you walk like a wife and i just thought of the things to me of what that means so the first one i came up with was to walk confidently like you already have everything you want you know you're not walking like you're on the prowl like you're looking at every guy wondering like is he is he it for me to see it for me you know you walk confident in yourself that you just have everything that you need yeah and um not that you should do this to become more attractive but i'll tell you from my perspective it's definitely an attractive quality um when a girl seems like they're constantly like in need of a guy there it's just something about it is a turn off for me personally and i think for most guys but when you see a girl who is just it seems like she's completely content with herself and her relationship with god and she's not necessarily looking for a guy it just makes you makes you want them the next thing i came up with is to walk like you have high standards i know that when you're single sometimes you can lower your standards because you're just like i'm never going to find what i want like i just need to take it down and just settle for something that's actually out there but don't do that you need to have high standards like just like a wife like a wife has high standards for who they hang out with because those people are gonna be taking away time from her husband so they better be darn good if they're gonna be taking away that time yeah so you know you don't be settling      it's a good thing you're in this video i know we do i'm really uh contributing here can you guys tell he's had a very busy few weeks and so it was up to me today to come up with our video topic which it's about time i'm the one always coming up with the video topics not always i just never get credit when i do do it step number three don't need credit for what you do the next thing is to walk like you have strict morals for yourself because that's what a wife would do you know she does a wife doesn't go around flirting with multiple guys being physical with multiple guys checking out multiple guys she's just one guy and that's her husband so when you say strict morals you mean like in their dating relationship like they should have boundaries yeah like strict boundaries and this is something that i've suggested guys doing in the past is letting it be known like hey i just want to let you know up front that i am not okay with going past a certain point physically or doing this and i think that would be a great thing for you girls to do as well and uh because most of the time you might find a guy out there that that comes up and says that ahead of time but most likely you won't i feel like that builds a lot of respect too like if you if you were to say something like that to a guy if you're with the right guy he will respect you for that oh yeah the next one that i came up with was to have a curfew for yourself like not getting home late because i feel like that's what wives do they don't get home late because they got a husband to get home too so not that you have a husband to get home to but you should still set a curfew for yourself of when you're going to be home when you expect yourself to be home because late nights with guys can turn into temptation and leading down rows that you don't want to go down so i think that that just shows the respect that you have for yourself and also the respect that you have for the other person if you're like i gotta be home by nine or whatever yeah and i don't know if you have to label it as a curfew but just letting them know that hey i want i want us to be home by this time because i think it's only going to be healthy for our relationship it's only going to help us prevent from uh falling into temptation um and yeah they will definitely respect you for that that's the definition of the curve i know it's the definition but something about the word curfew like i feel like if it i feel like if someone if a girl were to say hey i have a curfew i set for myself it would just sound a little weird announce it i'm just saying have one in your mind yeah but i didn't know anything she has to tell like if they're out hanging out at like 10 o'clock and they're like i'm adding a lot of value here the next thing is to walk with intention wives are intentional with their time with who they give their attention to they're not um you know playing games with multiple guys and that's something we suggest you do that's what we did in our relationship and something i actually told him from the very beginning was i'm not here to play games um what what would be an example of walking with intention like not playing games with guys you know like say that you want to text him but he hasn't text you and you're like well i'm just not going to text him because i don't want to seem too eager or too interested like to me that's a game if you want to text him do it yeah and you've probably heard me say it before but i i one of the things that really stuck out to me in sutton mine and sutton's dating life was when she told me that i never want you to have to worry he put that in our wedding vows it meant that much yeah when she said that i was like whoa whoa now who says that like no one's ever said that to me i feel like all girls have wanted me to do in the past is worry like worry if they like me or not or worry if they like somebody else yeah like when you go out with people you know not talking to them while you're while you're out with other with your friends or something just making them worry about you it's just a game yeah so sutton has always she's really walked that one out ever since the very beginning i feel like she's gone out of her way to make me feel secure in our relationship and it worked and it may not work with all guys but the guys that don't appreciate that you don't want to be with them last one that i came up with was to walk with value and self-worth you walk like somebody out there already has your heart which is true anyways because jesus does for most of us so you walk like someone already has your heart you're not looking you know for someone to fulfill a hole in you you're not looking for compliments and validation which kind of reminds me of social media and i feel like a lot of people fall into that trap is posting things on social media to set people up to compliment you i guess you know like if it's a picture say you're insecure about your body but you post a picture of it because you want people to tell you like oh you look so good you know you've lost weight whatever it is um i feel like you should walk with confidence of like you don't need you don't need that validation because you already know how great you are yeah and i think that's a great point and that there's also a fine line between being confident and being prideful so you don't you know you don't want to be like oh i never need a compliment i don't need anyone to tell me that i'm pretty or that i'm a good person because i'm so confident but i think if you start finding yourself falling into the trap of like needing validation on social media posting a picture in like hopes that people say how pretty you are or how you get a certain amount of likes then that that could be a giveaway that you might be falling into that trap of needing value and validation from other people yeah so that was it that was all that i came up with but we hope you guys enjoyed this and i hope it was helpful and hope it helps you walk like a wife and just wait you're gonna the guys are just gonna be flocking to you you're gonna be like a men magnet yeah and as we were going through these things i could see it being easy for like girls to hold on to like okay i'm gonna do that because that's gonna make more guys like me and that's gonna make guys more attracted to me but you gotta realize that's not the purpose behind doing these things these really need to become like in your core it's who you are like you you find your value in god you aren't crossing boundaries or settling or doing things that you normally want it to appeal to a guy you got to just become that wife do you think you did a good job with these things when you were not my wife um most of them i would say yes there's some that i didn't do and that's what made me think of them was like this would have been a good a good thing to have which ones were you good in and which ones were you weak in this has turned into an interview um the good ones i would say maybe being confident in myself i felt like i was confident like who i was and not really willing to change for a guy or anything or like needing that validation or compliments and stuff um something i was bad at i would say is the curfew i was good at the not playing games one two things that sutton did in our dating relationship that really stuck with me one i mentioned earlier about her saying that she never wanted me to have to worry about anything but number two and i've mentioned this in some of our past videos for those of you that follow us closely was her letting me know that she is very serious about our relationship and if anyone else is involved then she's out because he was trying to involve others because right when i was talking to her i was talking to another girl at the same time i think she kind of sensed that and she basically let it let it be known that if that was going to continue she was going to be exiting and and that made me that made me get serious real quickly yeah that goes into the just valuing yourself and your self-worth of like you know that you deserve better than that and i i'm pretty sure i told him that i was like i don't deserve for you like your attention to be split between me and somebody else and like i don't know that just felt so weird to me to be there was two of us like it was just so weird but you're on the bachelor but i feel like yes if you don't settle for that like let that be known that that's not okay with you then you're not gonna get walked on and you're gonna get what you want fight for what you want all right guys well if you enjoyed this video let us know and we might do uh how to walk like a husband yeah because i know all about that don't i no i didn't walk that i didn't walk like a great husband beforehand but i i think i learned how i should have walked i think there was a lot of things that i didn't do that i wish i did do that i hope i can teach our kids one day you guys are going to make a video about it because you really left them hanging there they're like what did you do yeah i did some really bad stuff next week for episode numbness joking all right guys well this is nate and sutton sewing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that was how to walk like a wife what is your go-to dance move pew pew pew pew pew pew pew     here we go what day is today today is q a when you do that i was like what are you doing i forgot about the song yeah all right hit me we're just jumping in yeah okay so you guys asked you to ask us some questions on instagram anything goes so i forgot about our intro okay what did you almost name oakland and halston that's a question yeah wow that's a good one because we almost had names for both of them i almost named oakland avery yeah we almost named oakland avery and we almost named halston embry avery and embry oakland halston yeah that's a big difference except even when we had oakland as oakland we were still going to name halston embry we weren't going to go with like the a.n endings i've always wanted to name our kids uh ivan that was like my name i've been holding on to since i was like a young ever since i watched the rocky movie for those of you that are rocky fans you know who ivan drago is i wanted my name my son to be named ivan and if you guys don't know our last name his name would be ivan eisenmann yeah i think that's cool but i want to tell him that that's stupid her whole family shot me down that ain't happening he can get himself a pet and name it that all right what's next do you find value in tithing i like that one what does that mean value just i think it's a good thing to do yeah answer it's a great thing to do we have been tithing since we got married and even on our own before that and it's just been very obvious to me that when we give our first fruits to god he is blessing us for that because i know that's what he wants us to do yeah i would say tithing has probably played one of the biggest impacts in my life out of anything i mean it's probably top 10 of like the biggest hard hitters in my life i think the best part of it is that when you're tithing your your first fruits like the first ten percent is teaching you to not have an attachment to money like you know right when you get your money giving it away can be hard for some people but since once you get yourself in that practice like giving it away it just gives you a heart of giving and you're not like mine mine it's my money you know it's god's money and i do think it's very important that when you tithe to not tithe an expectation that you're gonna receive more you know because then you're not coming from the right place but giving just knowing like wow i am so blessed like god has blessed me so much to be able to have what i have that yeah i'm gonna give i'm gonna give a portion of it away because he he calls us to do that oh i'll say this about tithing so when i was younger she's making a whole video about typing yeah i know i know when i wa i feel like the first time i ever really tithe that like stretched my faith i uh i received a lump sum of money when i was younger don't get any ideas don't think i'm like uh you know multi-millionaire anything like that or even a millionaire but i did receive some money that was a lot of money for me when i was younger and i wanted to give you know i felt like i should give 10 of it away but it was like wow they give 10 of this away that's like really hard uh and then when i did it when i did that the very next day i made almost to the dollar like that much money in a different way i feel like that was god telling me like i want i got a yeah i want you to tithe and i got you who's your childhood tv celebrity crush i loved the i want to say love but i like the olsen twins how it changes how old are you going like 10 you're like 10 years old maybe probably like 19. childhood i'm just chicken no i i would say from like ages maybe like yeah 10 to 13 or something mine was um peter pan jeremy sumter from like the real peter pan movie he was mine so your crush was like a man no he was a little boy oh i thought the real movie he was like a man no you didn't seen that movie you told me you haven't yeah but i thought you showed me who he was why haven't y'all been posting as much let's leave that one up to you why is that up to me because it is your fault i feel like yeah it's just yeah we take on too much too many things we take on so we're trying to figure out how to balance it all you know and i love making youtube videos but also i i don't want to ever to feel like an obligation or like a job like oh we gotta make a youtube video yeah like we have to come up with something to talk about i want it to come more from like a fun place so like we feel like god put a message on our heart to give to you guys or just something relevant i don't want to feel like i have to come up with a video topic but i do want to be consistent yeah and now that things are slowing down a little bit for us with the weddings hopefully we're going to be getting a little bit better if you were gonna die tomorrow how would you spend today that's hard i think i would gather all of our family and just sit in a room together if i was gonna die tomorrow something i really want to do is go to like our church has a night of worship where they just play the music and i love elevation church worship like their songs and stuff i've never been but i would love to go like their night of worship with our family that would be really fun which of you is the pickiest eater not even close is a hot dog a sandwich i would say no that's what one say what advice would you give to soon to be newlyweds we actually just had this conversation with my brother and sister-in-law because they just got married i think my biggest my advice to them was to pray together make it a habit of praying together on a consistent basis and also praying for the other person individually so like when you're not praying together pray for the other person on your own time and mine was to outdo one another in showing honor like um you know for me nathaniel we have our little weight like our little chores and stuff but i think it's nice to do those chores for the person if like his job is taking out the trash but if i see the trash full i should take out the trash you know i shouldn't just leave it there and be like that's your job but if you're both doing that you know it just makes you a good team member i feel like who do you think's ahead me you do who do you think i guess it depends on how you look at things like chores around the house you but in other areas i don't know what would you do if one of your kids came out as bisexual gay or trans never really thought about that but i know that i would love them like i think you love them through that and you don't support it because you know that's not what we believe in so i wouldn't like support their actions but i would still of course love them and try to like help them help them through that yeah i would love them for sure i wouldn't change my love for them at all but i would also um i felt like i'd be in the fight with them because i know it would be very tempting to act on their desires and i would i would fight with them to resist the temptation to live in sin like i will with all other sins if you could change one thing about your life right now what would it be i think i would change my a mindset that i have i i have a tendency to over obsess about things like i work really hard towards certain goals but i feel like being attached to the outcome and like upset if the outcome doesn't come to fruition the way i want it to happen that i hold on to those really strongly where i want to just like be able to let go and just be like yeah i mean i'll work hard but you know we'll see what god has planned for me which i feel like i do but not as much as i want to do what is your go-to dance move pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew oh my gosh if we went to high school together would we have dated each other heck yeah we would have what do you think this is i don't know if i would have liked his high school self but i would have saw her and like what do i need to do just i'll be who you want me to be yeah that was like definitely god's timing for us is i feel like kind of when he became who i would have been interested in is like right when we met wouldn't you say uh yeah what's the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you i don't know this is the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me but something that stands out my mind was when i was younger i was like so easily embarrassed like painfully embarrassed if people just looked at me like my face would just turn bright red i didn't talk much i didn't like to talk out like loud in front of the class or anything and went and i rode the bus home and on the first day of school when i did it it was like my first time ever riding the bus i didn't know anyone on there i was like one of the younger kids i accidentally got up on the wrong stop because it was like the closest to my house i couldn't imagine the bus was going to get any closer to my house so i got off and then the bus driver was like driving beside me and opened the doors and like yelled at me like get back on the bus that was not your stop like i knew and i did not know so like everyone on the bus was just like hearing her yell at me and i had to get back on and literally ride on the bus for about 10 feet and then get back off and it was like humiliating i don't think i've ever heard this story i'm pretty sure i went home and cried and then the next day my mom like got on the bus and talked to that lady which just made it even more embarrassing you know sutton's embarrassed when that face starts turning red yeah if we talk about it for a couple seconds it might turn red      no now no now my face is just has a mind of its own like it will turn red a lot and i'm i'm honestly not embarrassed but when i was younger it was bad i like it i think it shows her innocence did you guys shop for an engagement ring together that's interesting i feel like a lot of people do that nowadays which is kind of funny to me kind of not really she showed me a ring that like she really liked on pinterest no i didn't show him so my mom had rings that i liked which she she had i think even before i met him because she didn't want me to know at all like when an engagement was coming so she was like hey whenever the day comes why don't you show me some rings that you like so i'll no i'm like okay so i showed her so she showed them to him right maybe yeah yeah so her mom showed me a ring that she really liked that she had on my pinterest board and i did my goal to recreate it yeah i had no idea that our engagement was coming which was so fun to me like it's just funny to me if you'll pick out the ring together and they just know that it's coming like sometimes i'll ask people so when are you guys going to get married like probably in the next month we'll get engaged and i'm like how do you know that yeah definitely not our style if you could go back in time and do over something what would it be family feud i would go on that family feud and that fifth game we would answer the question right yeah and we would win that car because it's so funny that has been replayed in our minds like over and over like why why did we not say tennis yeah for those of you that don't know we were on family feud a couple years back and we won four games in a row and we were one question away from winning the fifth game and winning a brand new car and we got the last question wrong the other team got it right and they won and then they didn't even win their next game and they didn't win the twenty thousand dollars so he basically got beat for nothing are you choking no that's as close i have to be biggest highlight in low light in marriage that was our very first question today starting with a bang yeah it's a good one i know my low light we should start with the low and then work our way to the high you know your low light just like that well you know i just like we haven't had very many so i the one that we have stands out to me oh what's a low light do you mean like the the lowest moment we've ever had or like the lowest thing in general about marriage i was taking it as like a low moment okay and a high moment my lowest point of our relationship i don't know this this was not in marriage but it is like to me the lowest point of our relationship uh he had told me that he like has a desire to have a relationship with other girls or something like that but his wording like that was his wording which i it sounds horrible but like in his mind it's like not what he meant but that's what i heard is what he said so that was pretty bad we talked to our counselor about that worked our way through it now we're on the other side but for the record it was not fun times for the record i was saying that i just i would like to be able to communicate have conversations with other girl that girls that are friends that's it like he has any friends i don't know what he was talking about all right anyway the lowest point of our marriage for me is probably i think it was our first year we just there was times where we were like fighting quite a bit and um i guess we're just we did not know how to work out our issues and there was moments i thought she was going crazy on me i'm like dad come and i married a crazy woman oh right back at ya but we worked it out so if you're in that first year marriage and you think they're crazy there's hope stick it out you'll make it it's so funny too people told us like oh the first year's hardest get ready and we're like uh that's my house gonna be for us but yeah they were right all right highlight what's the highlight our highlight of marriage oh there's so many but golly there's a lot i feel like i mean i obviously having our kids was definitely a highlight like being able to make a kid together and raise them together has been so much fun um but also our honeymoon was like amazing yeah there's been so many like obviously great moments in our marriage from like our wedding day to having our kids to just so many like divinely awesome moments but to go to give you something that might be a little different than what you are than the obvious i'll say when we were moving into this house and we pulled i pulled up to this house before sutton got here with like the u-haul and i remember it was just like such a moment of just amazingness it was like i don't know you you always picture like you know living in your house with your wife and it was like that day had arrived it was just so cool to pull up to our brand new built our brandly new built house and there it was ready for us to move in together and start a life together that was pretty cool moment all right well that's it for today's q and a's if you guys have any video topics that you'd like us to cover coming up feel free to shoot them our way we're looking for good content to put out for y'all but in the meantime this is nate and sutton sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that was our q a what's up guys nate and sutton back with another video and today we are talking about the best the best gift ideas for your significant other yeah we thought what a better time to do this in christmas time people are shopping for gifts so we wanted to give you guys some ideas because sometimes it can be really hard and we've been there and also want to throw out there that none of this stuff is sponsored these are just things that we came up with that we think are good gift ideas good point they can thank us later so she's gonna list some gifts that she thinks is a good idea for guys and i'm gonna list some gift ideas that i think are good for girls so my first thing is actually the first gift some of them i have things to show and some of them i don't the first gift i ever gave nathaniel was a bible and this is it has his name on it and everything um you already had one before i gave this to you but i just feel like it was special because it was the first thing i ever gave him and it's like nice it's small it's cute yeah that was a great gift yeah i doubt your other one is cute solid gift a little tip on the bible though if you do do this you want to pay attention to what translation that you are giving them you may want to see what standard or what version that your significant other likes to read and make sure you get that same version otherwise you might throw them off a little bit a tip about getting the bible with their name on it so usually they do what it's called foil of like putting this silver stuff or whatever color the pages are on the name but i told them to just like indent the name so it's not silver i split that's kind of old school and i really like how it turned out so my first gift idea is a meaningful ornament oh that's a good one so a little tradition that me and sutton have picked up over the years is that we try to get an ornament that reflects a significant moment of that year or like if we go on a trip like when we went to montana we'll get like what did we get like a little bear ornament like a little bear ornament or uh we made an ornament out of oakland's footprint the year he was born and just cool little things like that our goal is to one year for our whole tree to be special meaningful ornaments yeah and and women love thoughtful gifts and what what a thoughtful gift that would be okay my next one i don't have the actual objects that's in the car but if you've ever heard of a drop stop that is a great gift for a guy because we call it the carmuta triangle like that space in between the like where your seat belt goes in and the console thing like if you drop something in there you're just never gonna find it so there's this thing called a drop stop and i think it was on shark tank right and it's just it's like the most simple thing it's just like this little strip of foam that goes over your seat belt you can get it to match your car seat so it just blends right in and it just blocks that hole yeah it's amazing it i have been driving so many times where my phone falls right through the crack and then the drop stop saves the day my next gift idea for the ladies is a nail slash spa day oh yeah so basically where you give them a gift card to like their favorite nail salon um or spa and just tell them this is really good if you have if you're married or you have kids and you can it can be like a double whammy gift like here's your gift to go get something for yourself but also a couple hours to do whatever you want you know what a dream my next thing i saw this ad one time that got me with the ad on instagram for these t-shirts it's called built so here's one of them these are nathaniel's favorite shirts ever and they have all different kinds they have solid colors they have henley's long sleeve short sleeve whatever you want and these are the shirts that fit him the best and they just are so comfortable and they don't ever get wrinkled which is something that's cool about them and he loves them so for most of the guys out there which is probably like 99 of them we like shirts that fit our bodies in a certain way you know they're tight around the good areas your arms and your waist um but they're also i like them where they're not so short you know i always have this problem with my shirts like show my stomach if i like put my hands up or but anyway these built shirts are my absolute favorite i got one in like every single color and the material is so comfortable they don't stretch out i felt like i struck gold when i got on this for christmas one year because i never heard of it and then they fit and i was like what they think yeah no shirt fits me properly but these shirts are awesome my next gift idea is this book right here there's two of them there's a husband in pursuit book and then there's a wife in pursuit book and i suggest getting both of them one for you is the husband and one for you the wife if you're a husband and wife and this is really a great thing to read even before you get married too but it's essentially a 31 day challenge where you both read a chapter a day and it walks you through these exercises and ideas on how to strengthen your relationship your marriage but it's called husband in pursuit 31 day challenge for loving your wife well and it's amazing it's a it's a book founded on biblical principles and i honestly believe like if anyone was having a struggling marriage and they read this book like it could really save your marriage yeah these were actually gifted to us my best friend sent these to us which was super nice thanks mackenzie and we love them and it's actually from the instagram if you guys follow it's called fierce marriage which is so great like they're always posting such great things and the husband and wife wrote these books the husband wrote the one to the guys and the wife wrote the one to the girls and it's been great so far all right my next one is special to my heart because this is my dad actually makes these belts i know we've talked about him on our channel before some of y'all follow him advice from dad so he makes these belts so the brand is called emmanuel raparo and emmanuel means god with us and raparo is shelter and protection so he makes these belts he has a casual one and a dressy one i didn't bring the dressy one down here with me but it's pretty cool so it has this thorn pattern along the whole belt um nathaniel's has been kind of worn in he wears this thing all the time um but the thorn pattern obviously for jesus just representation of what he did for us and wearing that every day is really cool and then for the dressy one there's also there's black and brown and the dressy one only has the thorn pattern on this edge of it y'all will see that online and then on the back it has romans 13 14 which is clothe yourself with the lord jesus christ so it's really cool it's a good meaningful gift he wraps it really nice and you know during this time i know it's going around of like supporting small business so you could get a really cool gift and also be supporting a small business yeah these belts i love i don't know why these belts are not like on the mainstream markets because these things are the bomb like i love these belts and uh i mean if you if you're gonna wear a belt why not wear the belt of truth you know my next gift idea which sutton has said this is probably her favorite gift that i've ever given her which is a ring with her birthstone on it yes i consider this ring to be my wedding van because i don't have i don't wear my wedding band i just love this ring so much so i love it what i did is i went to a ring store picked out a ring that i thought looked nice and then i asked them to replace what was in it with the with her birthstone yeah and that could also be cute you know if you have kids getting the kids birthstones or something else you know if if she doesn't like her birthstone i know how girls are i love my person my next one is this thing that also i think got me on instagram no this is from shark tank right oh my gosh and this is called manscaped and i'll just leave this up to your imagination once i show you what it looks like it's this little trimmer who knows what it's for but it's great and he loves it right it is a great gift yeah yeah we'll just leave it there so next gift idea is you can get a little creative with this one but anything that makes your significant other's job or their work easier or more enjoyable so for example me and sutton we filmed weddings and a lot of times we would film weddings in the winter and her hands would get so cold which is hard but i'm trying to like work a camera and i can't feel my hands yes our hands would get freezing so i bought these hand warmers it's like these little rocks that you hold onto they're like electrically powered rocks that you put in your pockets and you they warm your hands up when you're when you put your hands in your pockets so anyway the idea there was to a thoughtful gift to make her work more enjoyable so you could think of something that your significant other does in their field of work and what can you think of to make their everyday job easier my next thing is this little leather bracelet this was gifted to nathaniel from my parents but we think leather bracelets are really cool it's just like a simple gift and it's something a guy can wear i feel like dresses up their outfit a little bit but they have a verse on here they put psalms 127 3 to 5. you can look up what that says because i don't know it off the top of my head and on the inside it's got oakland and halston written on it so it's just another little meaningful gift that looks cool so my next gift idea is for those that have their significant other that loves to read and which seems to be like a lot of women out there love to read um so this is a really nice book light right here that just hooks on to their book and it has a light what's what's this called you know it's called a booklight where'd you get it it's called mighty bright my mom actually got me this because she saw my aunt with it and she loved it so much so she got one for me and it's great it's got like three uh brightness settings that you can switch it to and i've been using it every day i love it yeah my next gift is to get something that you guys like to do together like tennis rackets me and nathaniel love to play tennis so just an activity that creates quality time for y'all it could be anything i've heard of pickleball it's kind of like tennis that looks like fun i've wanted us to try to play that but just something that's like an activity for quality time because who doesn't like that yeah bikes could be a good one oh yeah that's a good expensive one but it's good all right guys well those are our gift ideas i hope they come in handy for you all this christmas season we're gonna link some of them below we're gonna look for them and hopefully we can find them all and we'll put the links below if you guys are interested yep but in the meantime let's see we'll probably see them before christmas right with your schedule probably not all right hopefully we'll see you all before christmas and if not we hope you all have an amazing christmas celebrating the life of jesus this is nathan sutton's sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that was our best gift ideas for your significant other for christmas or for any holiday or birthday or anniversary or anything what's up guys nathan sutton back with another video and today we are talking about how to persevere through anything what to do when there's nothing that we can do about our circumstances what a relevant topic yeah i know we just came off of 2020 which for many of us was arguably the most difficult year for a lot of people leading into 2021 it gives us an amazing opportunity to learn from and to grow our faith and we're going to talk about that in this video     so today we're going to talk about not only how to get through the tough times but how to come out better than you were before so we're going to start this off with james the brother of jesus what did he tell us about trials we're gonna learn from someone very special and that is the brother of jesus jesus who went through some serious trials in his life and james takeaway he tells us what he learned and how we can apply that to our own life in james chapter 1 verse 2 he tells us consider it pure joy my brothers when you face trials of many kinds not if you face trials but win meaning that we are like all guaranteed in our lifetime to be facing trials you may be going through something really difficult right now but all of us in our lifetime is going to be going through some difficult things and so we need to know how to handle it and he's telling us to consider it pure joy so hard in the moment consider it pure joy what does that even mean why would we consider our trials pure joy we're going to tell them so the reason that we should consider our trials as pure joy james tells us is because trials produce the testing of our faith and the testing of our faith produces perseverance and perseverance is basically like the ability to hold up under pressure or to hold up under stress and it strengthens it strengthens our faith and just like our just like muscles you know our faith is like a muscle and how do you get a muscle stronger is by working it out and our faith gets stronger by getting worked out and so james goes on to tell us to let perseverance finish its work so that we may be complete and mature not lacking anything meaning to embrace the trials that you're going through knowing that the very thing that we may be praying away or asking god to take out of our life that god can use that to strengthen you and your faith do you have an example for yourself of when you felt like you were going through a trial and you needed to like you got to work out your faith muscle yeah lots of times um i think the biggest trial that i think that i've ever gone through it wasn't it didn't even happen to me directly but i think it was probably still the biggest trial that i've ever gone through and we've talked about this a little bit on our channel was when my sister's boyfriend got killed in the belgium terrorist attack that was beyond difficult to handle not like for so and this is i love this example because this is kind of like the epitome of this video and what we're talking about so long story short it's my sister's boyfriend that was from belgium flying to atlanta to see her and he was in the airport when the terrorist attack blew up the airport and he died and receiving that news that morning it was just like what like i remember us praying so hard that it just wasn't true that like somehow he was alive throughout all of it but it turns out that he was not and to see you you see this you see this kind of situation and you think how could anything possibly good come out of this and looking back it's amazing to see what it how god used that situation in my sister's life to strengthen her faith and that was one of my biggest concerns is i thought my sister was never going to recover from it but it actually is something that created so much more faith in my sister what was your bit what's been one of your biggest trials a trial that happened for me was when i i've told you guys this before too is when i failed out of nursing school so that's what i was going to school for was to be a nurse which was so not my thing like i hated every second of it so it was really a blessing that i failed out but at the time it was like oh my gosh what am i gonna do because i had already spent like i dedicated three or four years of college to go to school to learn to be a nurse and then when that didn't work out i was like what am i gonna do and it was just a scary situation of just like not knowing i guess the unknown of the future but i feel like that was a testing of my faith and god sure came through because now we have a job that i'm just like so passionate about and i love it so much it's like every day that i i just consider it like i get to go to work not like i have to mm-hmm yeah and i feel like i just hear this this happens so much especially uh to people that i know of that have faith in god that he that he's going to use these situations to turn it around for their good it's amazing how many times i hear something like this where like when you're going through it it just seems so difficult and so challenging and some of you that are watching this might be going through something very difficult right now and you can't see it but when you look back on it especially when you go through it with the mindset of like i know i'm trusting you god i know that you're gonna make turn this into good for me and just having that faith that it's amazing um how god can do that yeah when i feel like i know a lot of people that have lost someone close to them like a husband or a child these horrific things that you can't even imagine like watching them go through it and watching their faith get strengthened is like such a testimony to me it's really like a supernatural thing i feel like when i watch them just like how how are you coming out better than you were when you've just experienced such heartache that like no one should have to go through and this brings us to our next point which is trials expose the authenticity of our faith meaning when we are pushed down and shaken and it it really shows us that do we have true faith like do we really believe that god is working all things for our good and that's why i feel like we say this first so many times like the verse of our life romans 8 28 and we know that god works all things for the good of those who love him like do you believe that because i love that verse so much because if it's like if you really believe that verse what do you have to worry about you know so trials they expose what kind of faith do we truly have you know when we are put under pressure and have difficult circumstances happening do we lose our faith are we do we lose our joy do we lose our peace or does it draw us closer to god knowing that okay god i may not know i may not see how you're working this out but i believe that you are working it for my good and so that's that's what i think james is talking about considering it pure joy when you when you go through trials because when you go through trials it it uh shows you the the authenticity of your faith whether in that discovery of what kind of faith you have that is pure joy now i know that everything that we've said so far in this video is way easier said than done and when you're in the midst of a trial you don't see any good in it and you're just like how am i ever going to get out of this but that is why james tells us to ask god to give us wisdom to be able to see what he's doing and to show us like what is the point of this why why am i going through this so the verse for that is james is saying if any of you lacks wisdom you should ask god who gives generously to all without finding fault and it will be given to you so he's saying it will be given to you like there's no it might or he could it will wisdom will be given to you yes which is pretty cool yeah i think that's awesome to have that kind of faith and then if you don't have the faith if you really just can't see what god sees ask him to give you the wisdom to see it and he promises that he will give it to you yeah have you ever known anyone to have that kind of faith that it's like you see what's going on in their life but they're just still filled with love and joy and peace those are the most inspiring kind of people because they should they give us a hope that it's their faith is not circumstantial it gives you hope that no matter what you're facing in life that you can still be filled with that peace love and joy that god provides us and i think those are the kind of people that leave the leave a mark on their lives and their the people around them and the world and a great way to close off this message is a quote from james since that's where we're at so he says blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because having stood the test that person will receive the crown of life that the lord has promised to those who love him now we don't know what the crown of life is but it sounds like something we want yeah so the take home message here is that god values and he uses persevering faith and i believe in miracles and that we should pray for miracles but the point is is that we shouldn't wait for a miracle until we live happily or peacefully that no matter what you're going through embracing it knowing that god has your hands that he is walking you through every valley and through every mountaintop and knowing that he's gonna work out everything for your good and that we don't choose our trials but we can choose our response to our trials and knowing that persevering faith leaves its mark on the world and those around you and a prayer to add to your prayer life could be heavenly father use this until you choose to remove this so just ask him to use whatever it is that you're going through until he chooses to take it away and then you can ask god for wisdom to understand how he can use your difficulties for his goodness all right okay guys well i hope that was encouraging to some of you i know this has been a tough year but let's go into 2021 with this kind of persevering faith that whether god blesses us with amazing and great things that are happening celebrate but even if they're not even if 2021 is 10 times harder than 2020 we have the persevering faith that we can get through anything knowing that god will work everything for us and for our goodness this is nate and sutton sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that is how to persevere through the hard times all right what is up guys what's going on i'm in a hat i've been no makeup and halston is here today's a different kind of day and we're in the corner we're in the corner what are we doing today so we wanted to go do a routine video with you guys to kind of show you what our day our daily devotional routine looks like and how we get rooted in the word and powered for the day and you know how we've talked about satan trying to ruin videos for us yes hawson he's supposed to be napping right now we waited to film this video during a nap so we could have it nice and quiet and he's been screaming his head off for like 15 minutes which i don't even know the last time he's done that do you so he's here so maybe this is supposed to maybe this is gonna be a really powerful video if we can get through it that's what i always like to think when i when satan tries to come and steal kill and destroy usually is a dead giveaway that he's he's not wanting something to happen how important is it to have a daily devotional as a husband and wife how important would you say that is i think it's so important not even just as a husband and wife but anybody in general should have time with god during your day we like to start our time like right now we're filming this in the afternoon because we're trying to wait for the nap but usually we do this first thing in the morning and i think it's the best start to the day what better way than starting than getting in god's word and reading truth and having him on your mind in your heart yeah and speaking of my hat today this is my new sewing seeds hat it's a lot some people say i look like a little boy with a hat on but it's the only way to cover up the hair when it's a mess yeah that's good um anyway so a typical day for us usually halsen is a wiggle no i'm just gonna let him lay here he's like a wiggle wiggle wiggle worm um anyways i like to start my daily devotionals with the right type of fuel i like to get filled up with some coffee it gets my brain going what do you put in your body for your daily devotional water if i have anything to drink i'm usually not drinking anything right then i feel like but anyway yeah i like to start my day with some coffee and then um anyway so we usually what we do is we kind of go through like a book of the bible at a time we just kind of pick and choose like we'll pick matthew or we'll pick proverbs or we'll pick john or we'll pick they get it huh they get it ephesians are you sure i don't think they understand how many books you can name i don't think they understand um and then we usually just read one chapter a day a chapter a day keeps the devil away yeah today we started proverbs and we usually like to read and then when we're done will i talk about what we read and ask each other questions if we have any lord yeah so we usually read a chapter together um it's become a little bit more difficult with kids because oakland used to be asleep during our devotional but now he's awake so it's a little more challenging but yeah we'll go through a chapter together and then after that we will some a little fun thing that we like to do it spices it up a little bit it's like if we're reading pretty common verses like i'll start the sentence and then try to have her finish it oh yeah i do like when i do that it really helps you pay attention like if you're not the one reading and you're just listening and i call you out on a on a like fill in the blank it makes it kind of fun because then it involves both both of you instead of just one person reading and one listening yeah so here's an example i'll put it on the spot right now we're in matthew come to me all who labor and are heavy laden i will give you rest take my yoke upon me and learn from me for i am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light there she goes matthew 11 28 and 30. uh-oh she's going even above and beyond usually we don't go that far that was one of our bible verses if you guys were following along with us on that on instagram at nate and sutton um we did that for throughout the whole alphabet each letter represented a verse and we committed ourselves to memorizing one a week and we did it yeah so we'll read a chapter it's not too much not too little you know it just seems to be the right amount of time for us and then from there we say our bible verses and for those of you that weren't on the bible verse train i it really has changed my life um what we did is we went through the bible or we went through the alphabet and uh created a new verse we tried to do one verse a week so like starting with a created or not creating but we came up with a verse or we didn't come up with it we just chose it we chose we chose a verse that started with that letter so like a b the first week we said a um and then the second week we did b and then c and then d and we tried to memorize it and um we would alternate so like i would go one day sam she would go the next day and then we got all the way through the alphabet last year that was a great accomplishment and so this year we started again like different versus starting at a so now we try to say like two verses for a two versus for b and we've been stuck on d for about three weeks now like our memories are like hitting their limit i know but i was never one to really memorize i'd only i may have known like two bible verses a year ago by heart but now i know like however many letters are in the alphabet plus more probably like 30 verses by heart that i can uh say so that's a great way to do it and real quickly we're going to interject this video to thank our sponsors function of beauty function of beauty coming at you today what you have for us hey guys we wanted to interrupt ourselves for a second here to thank function of beauty for sponsoring this video if you guys remember a while ago i tried out their hair care products which i loved and i'm still using and then i found out that now they have skin care products as well so anyway they sent me some products and i've been using them and i really like them they have this moisturizer cream a serum and then they have a cleanser and so the way that you use them is you start with the cleanser i'll put it on before i get in the shower and then i'll get in rinse it off and then when i get out i use the serum so i'll use that now these little packaging is so cute like these little bottles with the ombre so it comes in a little squirter like this and you just it doesn't take much you just use a little bit and rub it together i think i mentioned in the past i have really dry skin so this this stuff feels so nice on my skin my favorite thing of these three is the moisturizer cream because i have dry skin and so when i use this you're supposed to let this one dry and so i'll use this one before i get in the shower rinse it off get out of the shower i use the serum right before i go to bed i'll use the moisturizer and this stuff feels so nice i just feel like my it's nice and creamy like that and i just feel like my skin is just drinking it in similar to their hair care products where you take a quiz online they also do the same thing for skin care because they're personalizing it to you specifically which is really really nice something i really like about function of beauty skin care is that i feel like i can trust them because they never use parabens sulfates gmos or toxins and it's 100 vegan and cruelty free they also use the highest quality of products to target your skin goals so for example one of the things i chose was that i wanted my skin to be hydrated and the ingredients that they use for that is hyaluronic acid blue green algae and a very rich source of antioxidants you can get 20 off any bundle and a free selfie headband if you click the link below and then off we go off we go to our days and that's something that we've been very consistent with what did you say yeah very like if we don't do that one day it's kind of weird it's like why didn't we do this today yeah so i think it's been a very great foundation for our marriage it's it's it's uh you know it's a great way to start your day as a married couple a non-married couple or a single person it's just um what's another what's another saying they say start your day in the word not in the world did you make that up no i've heard someone say did i emphasize the words wrong you know how i do that no you did it right i think start your day in the word not in the world that's right you got it all right okay so more on our devotional time so we do all that all that we've said in the morning and then during the day we have our own little time that we do things by ourselves because it's also important to further your relationship and spend time with god alone not just together so i do mine at night so i like to we do our thing in the morning and then at night is when i do my thing by myself and i'll usually read in the bible and what i started doing is i found this website it's called enduring word bible commentary and i've been following that which has been really helpful they like break down so you read a chapter they're breaking down the chapter and telling you history about like why things were the way the way that they were why people said things that they said and just gives you more of a backstory and helps you understand it which has been so nice because sometimes it's hard to understand you know unless you're like a pastor i feel like of what's going on so it's been really helpful and then i my bible has note taking spots on the side and i can write down some things to help me in the future if i'm ever reading back through there i'll it'll help me remember like what they're talking about which has been nice and then sometimes if i'm if i don't want to read that night i'll do um what my doula she told me was called soaking and i'd never heard that before but it's where you just like be still and put on some worship music and you just relax and listen to it and that's very enjoyable if you've never tried that that's good i don't know you do that you soak i soak it um yeah so my quiet time i one thing that i felt like god convicted me of is i when i first started doing my quiet time with god i kind of did it like at the end of the day or like if i had time or um and i still i'm not saying i'm perfect about this but one thing i felt like i was convicted over was that i need to be giving god my best time in my day and usually that's like right in the morning like when i just had my coffee after i read the bible i feel the best i'm like ready to go and start the day and i can be really tempted to like start trying to get all my tasks done and i do do that sometimes but i try my best what do you want i try my best to do my quiet time at that time because that's when i feel like i'm most alert most energetic most ready to give it my all and that makes me sound bad by saying i do mine at the end of the day but for us it's flopped like the end of the day is when i get time by myself i get like an hour and a half or so to just be alone and i have a million things that i would like to be doing but i try to put my quiet time as priority and i get to my other stuff if i have time to get to it yeah anyway that's our daily devotional routine i hope you enjoyed it and uh hang with us through this season of life where we have two little babies we're trying our best to pump out content but it's not always the easiest we're in a very busy season of our life we're very grateful for it trying to soak it all in but not overwhelm ourselves to the point where we feel like we're just you know doing too much but something we do want to do is talk about everything that's been kind of going on in our world right now we feel like that's a really big topic and we might try and touch on that next video yeah yeah sutton said the other day she's like we gotta touch on what's going on in the world right now or else people are going to get angry at us no because i said that at church when i went to church on sunday i was like now if he doesn't interject his normal thing to talk about what's going on anyway as you can see as you can see we struggle we struggle so uh we're out for now but stay tuned hopefully we'll be bringing some politics into this youtube channel because that's all we need is some politics right because no one hears about politics we should talk about it yeah all right i love you guys thanks for watching our video this is our nate and sutton with our daily devotional i don't know how to say our ending anymore this is nate and sutton sewing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view a time and that was our daily devotional okay you do it almost every night there are so many questions about our sex life i guess that's a big big mystery in the youtube world maybe we should keep it a mystery you don't want to tell them tell them well we do it every night oh well i thought that was obvious are you trying to pretend like we do yeah       what's up guys nathan sutton back with another video and today we are going over the assumptions you guys have about us yeah it's been over well no it's been almost exactly a year since we last asked you guys your assumption so i figured you might have come up with some new ones within a year and we got some good ones let's hear them i haven't even read them okay first one is you want another dog that's a big fat no we love levi and i've always said like i'm never getting another dog because he's so perfect that no dog is gonna live up to my standards very true yeah we just don't think we can get one better than him nathaniel wakes up on the wrong side of the bed four out of seven mornings if by the wrong side of the bed you mean like literally because i'm on her side of the bed then yeah you did it correct no they mean in a bad mood but wouldn't you say that it's kind of a funny assumption because you're always saying you're on my side of the bed yeah he does wake up at like 3 a.m because i like to snuggle you're a good morning person thank you nate only eats grilled chicken and veggies they're really coming at you no not true at all although i wish i had more grilled chicken veggie meals because i feel like it would do me a lot of good like if you could just prepare me a good tasty grilled chicken and veggie uh meal for me i would be pretty happy about that someone asked a question about that we're gonna get to that in a minute or had an assumption about that you would like that oh yeah i would you guys are low-key racist but like most white people you don't know it low-key what does that even mean i know no i know people say that i don't like know what it means exactly um maybe like under the radar racist um no yeah i'm definitely not racist are you racist no i think i would know if i was racist because they say that we don't know it but i think i would know it if i was yeah i would think so you put water on your toothbrush before putting on toothpaste never would i do that what's the point i put maybe you think they meant to say you put water on your toothpaste after you put it on your toothbrush because that's what i do oh i definitely do i could never put a toothpaste toothbrush in my mouth without wetting it it's like soap i like you it's like soap and water like you need the water you have a lot of friends we have like maybe two friends i have three friends i told me my mom were talking about that yesterday how many friends i have i have three friends you have none you really don't think i have any i have friends you have one friend i have friends who i have brandon i have walker my brother your brother's on call it's family i'm not counting my sisters i have two friends okay he's got two friends he never talks to and i've got three friends that i talk to y'all spank your kids i don't know why that makes me laugh we don't do that yet we're doing the time out thing right now as punishment yeah i definitely don't want us make our kids if we don't have to but sometimes i wonder if they try to force you into it it's like nothing else works i really feel like with kids all they really need is one good spanking and then from that moment on you can just threaten the spanking and you don't have to do it again i don't want to spank them sutton can be very confrontational and hold her own that one was so funny to me because that was not the only person that said that there was like probably at least four people that said that i'm confrontational which is so not the truth yeah she's really not it's like the opposite of me like i was born in october so i'm a libra and the thing is like a peacemaker and i feel like that's what i am like if there's ever an argument going on i want it over before it even starts like i just don't want to do it it's true you'd rather pray for your nation than go deep into politics that's a good one yeah and that's true i'm sure that you guys have all noticed that we don't really get into politics on instagram or on here we've had thoughts of like we want to talk about it but at the same time we also feel like it's so dense and so complex that we just feel like we don't really know how to talk about it and we definitely don't want to be talking uneducated yeah i have this theory that almost no one knows the truth about politics you know you have these politicians who dedicate their whole lives and they can sit there and debate each other for hours and after listening to them you don't know who's telling the truth so it's like for me to pretend like i mean i can do my research and everything and but for me to pretend like i have the answers it i just feel like it's kind of naive but even if you do the research i feel like the websites and the computers are so modern that like you may not even find the truth yeah so it is it's definitely not one of those things that like we're too afraid to talk about it because i feel like that's like a gift that god has given me and sutton to speak the truth and not really be fearful about the consequences but when it comes to politics it's just kind of like i i find it very challenging to know the truth and so when you say when you assume that we'd rather pray for our nation and go deep into politics i think that's a good assumption because we know god has the answers and we can pray for our nation sutton is the one that punishes the kids when they do something wrong while nate just sits and chills that was kind of funny because i am with him most of the time so i do have to punish him but i feel like oakland doesn't really listen to me very much he's definitely getting better but there's a little time that he would listen to me and they'll just be like oakland and like look at him and then he would like literally duck and like hide behind the couch one of the things standing back there so he kind of has to come in sometimes for some reason oh glenn's like scared of him but he's never done anything to him like i don't know what he's so scared about yeah not all the time just sometimes i think sometimes he's in like this mood to cuddle and he views me as more like a play mate because i'm always like really rowdy with them real quickly we're going to interrupt this video to thank our sponsors felix gray yeah we've talked about felix gray before this is these are the glasses that we wear what they are is they're blue light blocking glasses which is really cool and blue light is something that we're actually exposed to all day every day really there's all kinds of sources of blue light and we need it for our cycles because the sun comes up it produces blue light it tells you to wake up and then when it goes down it's telling your body to produce melatonin for you to go to sleep so it's not all bad but these can block out the bad parts yeah so blue light is not the enemy but the problem is the overexposure to blue light or getting exposed to concentrated amounts of it at the wrong time such as staring at your phone at it right before you go to sleep common symptoms to overexposure of blue light include eye strain and fatigue headaches migraines and insomnia a main source of blue light is something as common as our phones it's something that we look at every day or even computers like for him he's staring at a computer all day and you can use the settings on your phone to do like the eye saver setting or whatever that makes your phone like an orange tint but actually that does not protect you from blue light all it is is it's nicer on your eyes it just feels nicer because the warmer tones the type of glasses that we got i personally like the black carver and i got the robling in clear felix gray glasses actually filter out 15 times more blue light than the typical blue light blocking glasses which is really cool felix great blue light blocking glasses come standard at 95 or you can get your prescriptions in your frames like we did starting at 145 one thing i really like about them is they're very comfortable and they're super lightweight you want a baby girl next yes i do think having it this was also one that was like a lot a lot of people were saying this and i would love to have a girl but i also feel like we're not gonna have a girl next i feel like no one's honest when they say what they want because they're like i'm you know i'll be happy with either and i will be happy with either but i want a girl but you want a girl next specifically yeah i want a girl next specifically i just want a girl in general like i would love to have a girl amongst the boys but as far as like next like she has to be next no they nate is so buffed up but sutton just don't care but trying to be happy about it for nate's sake you're not being modest you're very vanilla with your sex life yeah just like sutton it's time to have sex you think women and men are equal equal in what way i don't know you can't be so in-depth about every question you know i mean obviously obviously we're not equal equal in value yes equal in how we were made i mean no it's like so obvious right sutton is more impatient than nathanael oh absolutely i'm surprised you're even thinking about that i was still stuck on this sex question um oh yeah something's got some work to do nathaniel if patience means like waiting on something he can wait for you for like days but patience means like with our kids like crying or something i definitely have more patience the last time i lost my patients with him was when he was asking me the same question in different ways like multiple times or no when he asked dumb questions like this is so tough i just can only answer pleasantly for like the first three and then i'm like over it you'd consider divorce at one point in your marriage false false you are a trump supporter um the thing everyone wants to know this was another one that was very asked yeah i wouldn't say that we're like go trump go trump go trump but i would say that i would say that we voted for trump we sure did who'd you vote for come on youtube and tell us who you voted for so everyone can hate you      because no matter who you voted for there's haters here they come the last one is you guys are sensitive and that's the truth you think both of us yes i feel like we're both with each other like with things that we say to each other or do to each other we're very i also would say hyper sensitive to like the things that we say or do to each other but as far as like other people saying things about us like youtube you know like comments or people making videos bad videos about us that's just like water off our backs yeah i think we're sensitive in the areas that it matters like you know someone i really care about like sutton says something hurtful to me it just like shatters my heart into a million pieces it takes my days to get over it yeah but you know if like someone on here is like they're a trump supporter and i hate them then i'm like unsubscribe yeah i'm like all right that's all right with me all right guys thank you for watching our video hope you enjoyed it cheers to felix gray and uh this is nate and sutton sewing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that was your assumptions about us can you hear halston it's time it's time bye-bye what's up guys nathan sutton back with another video and today we are talking about how to have self-confidence when you don't feel good about yourself image is that the topic about your appearance about your appearance how do you do it sudden well this is actually really funny because i'm just realizing this right before we sat down to film this video as you guys could see we're in a different little setup we're closer to the camera and before we filmed this i said to myself i was like oh i'm glad that we still far away from the camera because i'm just not feeling good today and then i come downstairs and nathanael has this set up like this and i was like oh my gosh why are we sitting closer to the camera he likes the lighting but anyway what perfect timing why don't you like the way you look today yeah so i've never like had breakouts on my face in my whole life thank god but i would say like the most i've ever had is like two bumps at a time and that's very rare but something is happening to me and i have like these small little bumps i'm hoping you can't see them along my bottom lip line right here and then also right like under my eyes just these little bumps i've never heard of that i've tried googling it so like i can't find what it is so you're probably not feeling too good about your image today are you yeah so are you confident though not really so today we gotta listen to what we're preaching or i have to listen to what we're about to be preaching today because i'm talking to me too i'm feeling pretty confident today no actually not really my hair man my hair has been acting so weird lately i feel like i don't know i didn't know you thought yeah uh anyway so i feel like this is a good topic for us i mean for me especially because i at one time was extremely unhappy with the way i looked extremely and i would say it affected my confidence big time growing up i was very shy i always felt like people were looking at me like i was ugly like everyone everyone was better looking than me um and i felt like i had pretty good reason to think that because i did i was insert picture of younger nathaniel yeah maybe i'll insert some pictures here what's up guys today is for day 45 day 45 after my sharp surgery i was i was not the greatest looking fellow um so but i had the opportunity to work through that and i feel like i have come out on the other side and today i'm happy with the way i look i feel confident in myself um i mean there's always room for improvement but i feel like i've made a lot of progress how do you feel like you have been growing up did you were you confident did you like the way you looked i feel like growing up i really didn't think too much about the way i looked which i think is not that normal but now that like instagram is a thing like social media now i would say i probably think more about the way i look than i did when i was younger but when i was younger you know that stuff wasn't a thing so i guess i just didn't really pay attention to that honestly but i would assume the kids growing up nowadays you know like young teens right now probably have it very rough because they're like coming into themselves and at the same time that they're doing that they're seeing all these pictures that are edited and perfected and not real and like that's what they have to compare themselves to and it's constantly in their face like they're constantly on social media seeing these pictures and thinking like wow why don't i look like that yeah i definitely feel like the world is heading in a direction of it becoming more difficult for especially kids growing up with their confidence that they think they see other people think that everyone looks better than they do because of social media but it's really not the case um anyway so how how would someone have confidence if they're not happy with the way they look i would say the first thing is to find your confidence in who god says that you are you know god says that we're fearfully and wonderfully made that were made in his image there's like so much truth about you in the bible and i would first just fill yourself with god's truth and stop listening to satan and the lies and like what the world tells you yeah and when you're so focused on the way that you look it's if you think about it it's really a very self-centered mindset because you're putting so much importance on the way that you look and god calls us to not be self-centered but to be outward focused where we have our attention on others loving other people counting others more significant than ourselves so i feel like it's a very self-centered mindset it's very easy to fall into trust me i've been there many many times and i mean so much so i used to try to break my jaw i literally used to bang my jaw up against the foot of my parents bed frame to try to break it because i thought if i if i broke it then maybe i could go get surgery cosmetic surgery and make it look better because for those of you who don't know he had like a serious underbite so his teeth were like this yeah i grew up like i was talking that made me have a lisp so it made me really unreally self-conscious with the way i spoke and i made me not want to speak in front of people because people would make fun of the way i talked people are so mean to everybody dana talks like this and i used to have a chat i was born with a chest deformity where my chest sunk in and i was on the swim team so that was like always exposed but i feel like god really used those insecurities of mine to humble me and i don't shape who you are now because i've always told him i was like if you grew up like looking the way that he does now i think he's very good looking i don't think he would be who he is do you oh no i definitely feel like these challenges that i had shaped and made me become the person that i am today um but with that said uh i don't think there's anything wrong with trying to look your best you know i i think it's fine like to want to look good and try to do everything you can to work with what you have but i think the issue is when you start having placing so much focus on that like oh people would like me so much more if i was pretty or if i was better looking or maybe i would find the person in my dreams if i was better looking like that mindset i feel like it's straight from satan and that we as christians are not called to be focused on that for that to be a focus of any kind really right and i'll tell you something to me personality goes such a long ways like you may not be looking like a model or looking perfect but by gosh you can have a great personality and that can make you attractive yeah so some practical tips if i were back in my shoes when i was you know a teenager and i was really self-conscious of the way i looked i would tell my younger self to take your attention off of yourself and start focusing it on other people see how you can help people focus your energy on other things like becoming a better person becoming the person that god calls you to be praying about it taking these concerns to god and really surrendering that to him and you know just having that conversation with god like i know i was not put on this earth to be so worried about the way i look especially it's kind of like i feel a slap in god's face i mean if you are a human being breathing walking talking i mean that you are an incredible specimen you know and to get so caught up on the details of like oh my teeth aren't straight or my face isn't symmetrical or my eyes aren't blue all these things i just feel like it is it's a real slap in god's face because he created you you are his creation yeah and if you think about trying to like he said put the focus on other people so say you want to spend your energy becoming more generous or more kind more giving more loving i just feel like shining god's light in that way will make you attractive i mean i have definitely met people like that like they may not look the best but you're so drawn to them because they're just such a good person and that's what really matters yeah and i mean confidence is so huge that and i think when you start taking your focus off of yourself and onto other people and becoming everything god created you to be like sutton said it just makes you more attractive inevitably not that that should be your goal but that is just kind of the that's what happens and also i'll say this so i have noticed that when some people have certain maybe considered flaws about them or maybe they're not the best looking person in the room but they kind of own what they have to me that is like a really an attractive quality so for example like i've seen people who are overweight but they act like they just love that they're overweight you know like they're just they're not afraid of it and i'm not saying you should be overweight it's healthy to be overweight but um or it's a good or bad thing i'm just saying it's something that most people are self-conscious of but some people know how to own it and it's like wow that person they're awesome or like if i were when i was younger if i had you know my jaw issue i felt like i was always trying to hide it like i may have even like tried to cover my mouth when i was talking or i just didn't talk at all because i didn't want people to make fun of the way i talked or looked that i would have if i could go back in time i would really try to own it and maybe even make fun of myself like yeah i have this huge on your body it makes me talk all weird you know it's kind of a hard thing to do but if you can really try to find ways to own what god has given you and shine it the best way that you possibly can i think i mean that's all you can do can you do any better than that yeah i feel like if you have confidence in yourself it will like give people confidence in you yeah and uh for example one thing i'm kind of self-conscious about is my calves the men in my family just it's like it's like someone deflated our calves when we were born and they just they're like little twigs so i could i can take one of two routes there i can like try to hide my calves i can try to you know avoid them but a lot of times i just kind of make fun of myself like any time the conversation anything around that conversation comes up i always kind of you know i'm like oh yeah i have the biggest cabs in the room kind of thing but obviously i'm like i have the skinniest cabs ever so i think it's just to not take yourself so seriously learn to make light of your flaws and and just love yourself for who god made you to be and i feel like you're going to draw people in by being confident there's a fine line between like confidence and arrogance like we're not talking about like flaunting yourself or like coming across really again but just like being confident in who god made you yeah yeah and uh i don't think there's anything wrong with doing things that make you feel like more attractive uh like for me i feel like one of the things that makes me feel pretty is uh getting a tan you know i feel like going outside laying out in the sun i get tan and i'm like yeah i feel good about myself or like dressing a certain way um eating eating cleaner i used to have really bad acne and for any of you out there that are really struggling with acne something that healed me of my acne was raw milk um if you can find raw milk anywhere in your area why don't you tell them what that is so that they know yeah raw milk is basically milk that comes from cows or goats or whatever that hasn't been processed or that hasn't been cooked or homogenized um and you can find these like local farmers markets and stuff like that but it helps it helps long story short it really helps with acne for most people you can make a whole video about that topic he's very passionate about his milk but anyway guys um i know this can be a tough subject for a lot of people and it's not a fun world to live in that when you don't feel good about yourself and i really i know what that feels like and uh and i thank god that i feel like i have grown out of that and um you know it's it's just straight from satan really is what i believe it is he wants us to be defeated and not see the beauty that we are yeah i'm currently working today right now with this stuff going on my face i'm like been wearing my glasses to the gym i never work out my glasses but i'm like trying to hide my eyes to wear my glasses yeah i'll say one more thing about comparing yourself to other people there's just no win in it it's a lose-lose situation because if you compare yourself to people that you think you look better than well now you feel prideful and arrogant and you think you're better looking than someone else and it just comes from a place of pride and that's not winning but also when you compare yourself to other people and you feel less than them then you feel you know defeated and you're not recognizing the beauty that god has given you so really trying to take your attention off of yourself comparing yourself to other people and focusing on um loving other people and not not worry so much about yourself all right guys well this is nate and sutton sewing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that is how to live confidently when you don't like your appearance all right you ready yeah can you just like scoot over a little bit easier are you kidding me i really i'm just feeling claustrophobic i just feel like you're so picky about the way we sit it's kind of ridiculous today's topic is about fighting and i thought it'd be funny if we do a little pretend fight to test our acting skills but clearly i'm the better actor which we've known our whole marriage he thinks he like missed his calling as an actor how'd i do rape me on a scale 1-10 should i try out for   hollywood     what's up guys nathan sutton back with another video and today we are talking about how to never lose another argument again yeah that's a big deal because for us personally fighting in our marriage i would say has been our weakest point yeah yeah it's been our weakest point because i usually resort to violence but we got this idea from our church um they talked about this a couple weekends ago we thought this was like a great topic because it's super helpful so credit goes out to them thank you kevin and he actually wrote a book about this it's called the second happy if you guys want to look it up you might could get it yes our church did a sermon on this recently that really hit home for us and that's basically how to fight how to argue uh as a couple as a married couple and um and i just thought it was really genius yeah this is basically going to be a step-by-step process of like how to argue with each other and this could go for anyone this doesn't have to be married couples this could be dating engaged this could be with your friends like it doesn't matter who it is your siblings yeah okay so there's five steps to begin with of calling for the fight so you can't just like come up to each other like starting the argument right off the bat you know if i went up to him it was like you let the toilet seat up again like you can't be coming at them so hard you have to call for it so i would go to him and i would say hey i have something i'd like to talk to you about later so he knows that like something's coming yes so that's not always easy to do this so like sometimes things just happen in the moment and you get mad at someone and you start saying things in an angry way so as you as that starts happening it might be a good idea to take a step back and like okay this is starting to turn into an argument it's time we need to call for a discussion about this and i actually think this is also a good idea because sometimes when you're calling for the discussion in your own time before the discussion happens you could resolve it in your own life like it's not that big of a deal yeah so i i think what happens for most people is they start getting into a little bickering and it just starts building and building and and you just want to keep going and keep going but that's our step number one here is to take a step back and be like okay ah this is starting to turn into an argument we need to have a discussion about this and it could be right then or it could be later on but it might be wise to take a few minutes take a breather step number two is defining the issue so after you tell them you want to talk to them you guys tell them what it's about you can't just say i want to talk to you later and their mind is just going like what what happened what are we going to talk about you have to tell them what it's going to be about so that they know when you know and you're coming together in a fair way to talk about it okay so step number three is one that i could probably use some help on and that's why you're the one saying that and that is scheduling the fight you know not letting it linger i know for me i i feel like i just kind of want to not talk about it for a while whether that means hours or days i just want to like get over it in my own timing but i know that's something that drives sutton nuts because she's just like not really knowing when we're gonna talk about it so step number three is to schedule it so being like okay at two o'clock after my period is finished we will talk my man period is finished we will talk about our argument step number four is to show up and lovingly engage with each other so i think that that's why it's good to schedule the fight it's because you're taking some time to cool down you know it's not the heat of the moment highly suggest you pray about the argument going into it maybe even together i mean a lot of people can't do that i don't know i mean you could do that really and like the heat of an argument like pray together but we should maybe we should try that that's what my best friend's paul reese shout out says that he does with his wife i'm like man you got a gift and i was like listen to paul all right step number five is to keep the fight clean you know going into the fight knowing that you're not going to be doing any low blows not going to be name-calling not going to be bringing up things from years ago you're talking about this the matter at hand yeah so now we're going to tell you that's like all the prerequisites to the fight but now you're coming to the fight what do you do how do you start who talks first things like that so this whole thing of the actual fight is set up into three stages step one is communication stage two is compromise and stage three is counseling so you're going to start with communication so the way that you start is one person is going to go first so you choose however it goes in your relationship for us what who would you say goes first we've never actually done these things because we haven't had a fight since we've listened to it but we're gonna do it next time i'd probably suggest that you go first since you're the weaker vessel i was gonna say you go first jk all you feminists out there jk shout out okay so for the sake of this we'll say that i'm going first so the first thing you do is we sit down and i tell my side first so i think we should actually like use one of our real arguments for this yeah yeah i think this is probably the most important factor of any argument is letting one person fully express how they feel without being interrupted and confirming that they have been heard and then vice versa so that's what this is right now so you want to talk about one of our most recent arguments what's been our last argument that trip from the airport okay okay so what i'll give you a short little thing of what happened so nathan been gone all weekend he went to shoot a wedding out of state um i was at home and he gets home from he's at the airport he's driving home he calls me he's like what did you have for dinner and i said uh sandwich and he was like a sandwich really and i'm like yeah why it's 9 30 at night right now and um he was like well what am i gonna eat which i didn't know he wouldn't have eaten at 9 30 at night so i was like i don't know i mean we have i can make you one of these sandwiches we have frozen pizza i named off a few things and he's like so basically my options are a sandwich or pizza like he was not happy and i was like i mean that's just what we've got and he said he would like if a meal was prepared for him when he gets home which is fair should you be telling them the story should we actually reenact it i don't know i feel like they need a basis of what was happening all right that's the basis okay okay so that was the basis of the argument okay so if we were doing this verify rules i would talk first and i would say um i think it's fair for you that you want something to eat when you get home that's fair you've had a long day but you it's not fair to get mad at me for not like reading your mind and knowing that you want that because you didn't ask for that and if you would have asked i didn't do it then you could get mad but getting mad at me for something that i didn't know is not fair because at 9 30 at night i would assume you've already eaten dinner okay so that's the first step the second thing that's supposed to happen is that he listens to me like he just was he doesn't say anything and at the when i'm done talking he's not sitting there like trying to think of what he's going to say like all of his comebacks to me he's just listening and the next thing is that he confirms what i said so i know that he heard me okay so what i'm hearing you say to me right now is that you basically just you think it's important that i have dinner but you think you just thought i would have already eaten and it's not fair for me to get mad at you for something that you didn't know about yes so then so once he repeats to me what i'm feeling if he gets it right i say yeah that's right or if he gets it wrong then i tell it again and try and tell it in a different way okay so at this point she has expressed herself to me i have successfully programmed what she said into my brain i've heard her and so now it would be his turn okay so this is mine um all right so the reason i'm mad is because it would just be nice for you to have considered my situation like a little forethought of okay nathaniel he's flying across the country today he just got off a four-hour flight probably the last thing he wants to do is get off the plane at nine o'clock at night and go find dinner for himself it would just be nice if you would think about that like you may have not known it but i wish you would just be thinking like kind of have that mindset of i want to be i want to i would like to welcome nathaniel home from a long work weekend with a nice dinner not even nice just anything oh i feel like he's like getting really passionate about this oh i'm passionate okay so the next thing would be vice versa i would confirm what he said so what you want is for me to know that when you're traveling and you're gonna get home late you need to have food ready for you and i mean there's a piece of that missing what i would like you to just think about me my food needs oh to think about your food needs and if you don't tell me then maybe i should just ask you if you've eaten or if you plan to eat or if you want something at home so is that right yeah yeah so that whole back and forth thing is the stage one of the communication that's what we just did was communicating stage two is compromise so now that we've talked about the whole thing i would offer up a solution which i kind of just did in the previous step okay so i offer a solution so i would say next time you go somewhere if you're not going to eat tell me your plants for food and if you need something when you get home i can have it ready so that happens then he suggests his suggestions all right my suggestion would be that you know if i'm especially on a work weekend and i'm getting home late that you just put a little forethought into my dinner situation whether that be asking me if what i'm gonna be eating or if you would like me if you would like to make something for us to eat together or just me that would be my suggestion okay so after that happens we have to discuss what we both talked about the suggestions we both gave and choose one and then once we choose an option you can like write it out and even sign it so you know like next time this happens which that will happen for us in the future because he goes to film weddings a lot on the weekends so this will happen again and you like write it out sign it like this is how it's going to go and you're both agreeing to do it that way okay so our agreement is that we're going to do a little mix of both i'm gonna try to think of my own dinner needs if possible like i might not be eating dinner try to think for myself a little bit and you are going to ask me okay does that sound like a good compromise yeah you sure yeah okay and you're gonna ask me about my needs what do you mean does that sound right yeah that's what you said okay all right i feel good about that do you feel good about that great all right i can't wait to ask you about your dinner plans the last stage is counseling so you have communication compromise and then counseling so if you get stuck at the previous step where you're trying to figure out like what's going to be the most fair what's the thing that we're going to sign that we're both going to agree on and you can't come to an agreement that's when you seek counseling okay so the first step of counseling is your list of trusted friends so if you have some good quality friends in your circle go to them ask them their opinion on how you guys can come to a better compromise because a lot of the times when you're involved in an issue it's so difficult to see the solution to your own problems but people from the outside can usually see a lot more clearly what's actually going on and how to solve that and a very important tip about that stage is that this needs to be a list of trusted friends that you agree on so he would say i'm going to go talk to paul and i would say yes or no like am i comfortable with that or not and then i would tell him like i'm gonna go talk to mckenzie and then he would say yes or no so you have to be agreeing upon the friends that you're gonna be talking to the next step in the counseling phase is we each talk to our friends we come back together we discuss our friend's advice and then we try again to seek a compromise once we've heard some outsider's perspective and then if that doesn't work we suggest meeting with a pastor or a marriage counselor to make sure that you guys come upon a good godly agreement and the very last thing is you process your counseling and then you seek a compromise and hopefully after all that you've come to a compromise yeah so let's break it down real quick what are the first like we just summarize the whole thing okay summarize the whole thing is that before you guys have a fight you need to call for it set a time and a date and keep it fair then when you get to the fight um you start in the communication phase where you're taking turns talking key i feel like that right there could save marriages yeah like not yelling over each other and actually seeking to hear and not to be heard because i feel like everyone goes into a fight like wanting to word vomit all of their opinions about whatever it is on to the other person when really you should be seeking to hear and understand the other person be quick to listen slow to speak so you've communicated you've hurt each other you know what's going on and then you compromise so you try to come to that agreement and then if the compromising isn't working between your own decisions you then seek counsel so communication compromise counseling boom yeah we thought this message was like so valuable when we first heard it um because fighting is just not a strong point in our marriage so next time we have an argument we are going to try this and we hope you guys do too because i really think it would be really beneficial and our pastor actually wrote a book about this and marriage and it's called the second happy um and so it goes it tells about all this stuff into more detail than we just did and then a bunch of other um tips and tricks to make your marriage as good as it can be yep that's it all right guys so this is nate and sutton sowing seeds of truth love and inspiration one view at a time and that was how to never lose a fight and if you do lose the men out there we know the last resort what you just overpowered the woman you create so much hate
